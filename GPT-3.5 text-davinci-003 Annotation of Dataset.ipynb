verbals (words formed from a verb, but functioning as a different part of speech e.g., gerunds and participles) naming aspects should be annotated as aspect terms.\\n-Subjectivity indicators (i.e., words/phrases expressing opinion, evaluation etc.) are not considered aspect terms or parts of aspect terms. \\n-If an aspect term appears in a sentence more than once, all of its occurrences in the sentence should be annotated. \\n-The identified aspect terms should be annotated even if they appear in quotation marks or brackets.\\n-The identified aspect terms should be annotated as they appear, even if misspelled.\\n-Determiners (e.g., “a”, “the”, “some”, “many”, “all”) should not be included in aspect terms, unless they are parts of embedded noun phrases. \\n-References to the target entity
