With a movie called "Gayniggers from Outer Space" how could you go wrong? Just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters, utilizes the Village People as the main suppliers for the soundtrack, and throw in tons of gay-gags. Plot is unimportant. Too bad, this film doesn't contain any of this and every joke lacked the taint. The characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger, one or two jokes work, the rest fails.The title made me laugh and I was prepared to laugh even more about the film. My expectation were to high apparently.$LABEL$0,1,1
Play Mystery Theater 3000 at home with your friends! Rent this movie for the laughs! The behaving is poor, the sounds is terrible and the fights are ridiculously unbelievable. I thought the movie was a joke until I looked it up on IMBD. I can't wait to rent the sequel, China O'Brien II.$LABEL$0,1,1
A shaming, nobody seems to know this meagre thriller-masterpiece. Everytime bigger budgeted movies fail, "Terminal Choice" affords lots of thrills, convulsions and bloody violence. A little seen mgm, that deserves being raided for in your local video shop. That anonymous guy beneath is quite right, when he says, you'll never trust hospitals again... it IS that effective ! Good ending,too, not really a twist, but it doesn't end the way one thought it would. Yep, that's Ellen Barkin in an early role...$LABEL$1,1,0
Spooks is enjoyable litter, featuring some well directed sequences, ridiculous plots and dialogue, and some third rate acting.Many have described this is a UK version of "24", and one can see the similarities. The American version shares the weak silly plots, but the execution is so much slicker, sexier and I suspect, expensive.Some people describe weak comedy as "gentle comedy". This is gentle spy story hour, the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre.Give me Smiley any day.$LABEL$0,1,1
Simply but imaginatively filmed studio-set performance short, a perfect match of music and images that defines the very coolness of cool and the hipness of hip. The precise visual and musical arrangements give the lie to its claim to be a record of a jam session: what it is, is a pop video - every bit as stylised and cognizant as that implies, and all the better for it. Among the very best music films ever made, and almost certainly the most cinematic. These cats are solid gone, daddy-o ...$LABEL$1,1,0
I was very skeptical about jeopardizing my cherished time to watch this film. I didn't enjoy the first one at all, and the last Jean Claude Van Damme film I liked was Blood Sports! After managing to sit through it all? Avoid, avoid, avoid!!$LABEL$0,1,1
Technologically abominable (with audible "pops" between scenes)and awesomely unprofessional, "Flesh" requires a lots of patience to assis through and will probably turn off most viewers; but the dialogue rings marvellously authentic and Joe Dallesandro, who exposes his body in nigh each scene, also gives an utterly convincing performance. A curio, to be sure, but the more polished "Trash", made two years later, is a definite step forward. I suggest you watch that instead. (*1/2)$LABEL$0,1,1
I never thought I would absolutly hate an Arnold Schwartzeneggar film, PERO this is is gruesome from the get go. there wouldnt one redeemable scene in the entire 123 long minutes. an absolute waste of time thank yu Jay harris$LABEL$0,1,1
As a child growing up in the Sydney of the 1950s, I can readily identify with the content of this fined film. Each week I toured the Wynyard Newsreel cinema on George Street to watch the Cinesound (and usually 3 Stooges) shorts. Never has there been a better blending of B/W and colour in a film. Faultless productive values round off a never to be forgotten movie experience.$LABEL$1,1,0
The opening credits are pure poetry and I have watched it several times. It had a mundane 20's adventure feel to it. Of course Kathy is gorgeous, but that voice! Did she realize this was a talkie. One word--voice coach. Phenomenal film for chronic insomnia (along with a bottle of scotch).$LABEL$0,1,1
Verhoeven's movie was utter and complete detritus. He's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed. By his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored, and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.Heinlein would have NEVER supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it. It basically steals the name, mocks politics of the book (which is a good portion of it), and throws in some T&A so the average idiot American moviegoer doesn't get bored.This anime isn't perfect, but it's at least mostly accurate, as best I can tell.$LABEL$1,1,0
This is one of Jackies best films that is him without opera buddies Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao it has uno of the best openings in any action film and it carrys on in that way with Jackie showing some high quality stunts the only critisim is that in the middle it gets a bit slow but it shows up for a frantic last 25 mins in the film and the end credits show what a crazy fool jackie chan is just to keep us film addicts happy$LABEL$1,1,0
Claire Denis' debut is both a valiant and self-assured one. During this depiction of life towards the end of French colonialist Cameroon, she explored the relationships between mens and women, black and white.With the black servant 'Prot√©e' as the film's primary object of desire and oppression, the film enters taboo territory from the beginning. Denis builds a picture of life through a serials of character relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed to the screen. The mood of the film is captured perfectly by the camera-work and (lack of) lit.A great discourse.$LABEL$1,1,0
A noble endeavor, I guess, but ultimately a pauper one. Before seeing this film, I felt "Bartleby, The Scrivener" was unfilmable. After seeing it, I still do. Unfortunately, I think only those who have read the stories will understand what is going on, and they will be upset at the film's needless revisions (updating from 1850 to 1970, relocating from New York to London). Yet the superb talents of Paul Scofield can't salvage what looks to me like a well sense but misguided effort to film Melville's metaphysical classic.$LABEL$0,1,1
It was stringent watching Harrison Ford obsessing over nothing. Christine Scott-Thomas should have slapped this guy and tell him to take a hike.Savings your moneys. Don't even bother with a rental fee, unless you need a good siesta.$LABEL$0,1,1
A DAMN BUENO MOVIE! One that is seriously underrated. The songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain, but also their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg puts in a good performance here, but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character. I wish she was in more movies.This movie should have a higher rating. I give it a 10/10.$LABEL$1,1,0
Entirety y'all hatin' on the doing you'd arguably neva make the cut for "Second String" need to save it. If more boys out there took their desolated behinds to the gym for once...maybe y'all have a chance....bah,...maybe.

I've seen a lot of stupid plotlines in my time, but this one is among the hardest. After catching some disease in space, an astronaut comes back to Earth and starts melting. He then goes on a rampage, killing people (how is beyond me; I just watch them, I can't explain them.) This is the kind of movie that shouldn't have been made in the first place.$LABEL$0,1,1
