Antics, a wee bit far-fetched. Retired Secret Service Agent Swamp Morgan is sent to handle a potential 'firefly' case involving the murder of several doctors and nurses at a plastic surgery clinic. Apparently the doctors are in the habit of taping their patients while they are recovering from surgery and blackmailing them with the details at a later date. During one of the recovered transcripts a suspicious transcript surfaces about a bomb plot. Could it just be the ramblings of an unconcious man, or something more sinsiter?This story starts off a bit slow with the killer targeting the doctors and nurses. But the character, Swamp is likeable and methodical in his detective work. The middle section involves Connie, a nurse who was off-duty the night of the murder and her struggle with being bait for the killer.I'm giving this 4 stars just because the ending was really goofy. I can't give it away, but... Well... It was a gotcha type ending you are either going to like or loathe.$LABEL$1,1,0

Don't refuse your treasury!. My husband bought me the Magic Bullet for Christmas. He paid $60 for it at a department store. At first I was so impressed by it. We used it almost every day. When we had our first baby I used it to make homemade baby food to save money. I will honestly say that it does work very well....AT FIRST. You'll love it, then be disappointed when it breaks. Before 1 year was up the motor died and it stopped working. This also happened to three of my friends who bought the magic bullet. The customer service stinks and they won't replace it. In my opinion, $60 for 1 year of use is not worth it. You'd be better off spending less on a generic brand blender that does the same thing. I bought a less expensive brand on sale for $15 and so far it works just as well as the Magic Bullet for a fraction of the price!$LABEL$0,1,1
Short of Learning Latin, Greek, etc.. Dear Potential Reading:I have nothing but hailed for Dr. Danner's _Pinpoint It_. He has taken one of the best methods for self-help education, the graduated inductive method, and combined it with truthful notification about the origins of English words. The reader is led, step by solis, into developing an ever larger and more spiked English vocabulary. I would say that anyone who works through the unmitigated literature will acquire a level of etymological knowledge and a facility with English vocabulary that normally could only be produced by a course in etymology taught at the college level. My own preference would be for students to learn the relevant languages; _semper nobis linguae addiscendae sunt_. But short of learning Latin, Greek, French, and German, you can do nothing better for building your English vocabulary than to buy and use Danner's _Discover It!_. I highly recommend it.$LABEL$1,1,0

Ranch Style aspires to traction a fast one. I've been eating Ranch Style Mung all my life and love them. They were made in Fort Worth, Texas for nearly a hundred years.

Now fully a third of each can is sauce...they're selling us WATER. They taste the same and for that I'm grateful, but the can says "Beans" and I expect beans...not water.

EGREGIOUS writing on a fascinating topic. I'm sure Richard Ellis is a fine fellow. But I just can't understand how _anyone_ gave this book a positive review, and I'm 2/3 through it.

Well on page 108 he gives you a long quote from what he tells you is an article from Roper and Boss -- and in _the very next paragraph_ he gives you _the same quote_ again and attributes it! Amazing! And this kind of thing happens continually. How many times does he tell me how big, say, squid axons are versus human axons? I mean, really: this book went totally unedited. Beyond that the comments of other reviewers that he kind of struggles to fill a book about the squid, are true. Of course some of the amazing footage of the past couple years could've been used to pad it out another chapter, but, there's just not enough there there, or at least Ellis isn't able to make it seem so.$LABEL$0,1,1

Fingerprinting not worthwhile the time or treasuries!.

I only had the printer two age, with little resort and innumerable subjects. Both literature that is made with the pen toolbox began to improvisation. This is an expensive experiencing, considering I could simply grab the digital images to a local bookstores and have them printed for as low as 17 cents a copy. It does take up space in the suitcase, with carrying the printer/powercord/USB cable/ink paper and tray. I used it very little and it recently started to print on only one-half of the photo paper! I contacted Canon, after some basic cleaning and trouble shooting. Canon could not offer any further advice, except that I would need to send it in for repair.

Unnerving fecund. I'm not a hard core Collective Soul fan, but I admire them enough to own several CDs. I also own the "Music in High Places" dvd, which I was very impressed with. I decided to buy this dvd based on the excellent customer reviews. However, in my opinion, the large concert hall format is distracting from the real talent of the band. The orchestra, instead of adding to the live experience, left me with a feeling of chaos and dilution. Collective Soul is a talented group of men, but their talent is not evident in this production. The "Music in High Places" dvd showcases their excellent musicianship and vocal abilities that this production manages to completely cover up. For a more casual fan, I would not recommend this dvd for an introduction to the band. You just might be fooled into thinking Collective Soul has no talent.$LABEL$0,1,1

I would have given it a five star but a lot of the songs extinction out long before they are done. It has a good elected of different kinds of music, vocal, percussion, string, etc. The main reason I genera it so much is that it features Babatunde Olatunji on tracks 2,3, and 14-20. This is rarely heard Baba music especially to those only familier with his "Drums Of Passion" recordings. Some of the sound quality is not that great but I've heard much worse on other recordings.

What a reaching!!. I watched this movie only because Vincent D'onofrio was in it. And am I glad that I did. I had heard of Robert E. Howard and knew he was a writer, but I didn't know anything else about him. This film shows the depth and loneliness of a man who didn't fit in with the rest of the world; and then he meets a woman who begins to understand and to love him, but ultimately cannot be with him.Vincent D'onofrio gives a wonderful impassioned performance as Howard and Renee Zellweger matches him as Novalyne Price, the woman who befriends him. This film is well worth seeing and I recommend it to everyone. It also contains the most passionate kissing scene I have every seen in a movie. I had to rewind and watch it more than once.

Every time a problem arises, Mado races to the rescue (probably in an effort to prove to Dad that he should have loved her best)And if that's the point, then Harris failed to show me that the issue was with Mado and not with Harris herself.

Not as super as it sounds. Instead of buying this book, I went to the library to check it out and after reading the other reviews, I was rather dispirited.

He responded with common sense advice and even fluently advice that "beats around the bush" (indirect alderman). For the average healthy bride I recommend lu the book by the Knot (don't remember what it is called but it has "The Knot" in the title).

I had more hopes for this particular series but the author appears to be squandering it away with another Jordan-like fiasco. If you want tightly woven, well-written fantasy, don't expect to be satisfied here. Look at Pullman's provocative and beautiful His Dark Materials, or Ursula K Leguin's thoughtful trilogy.

unspectacular. I'd written a review for this game when I was in the middle of playing it. Once I finished, I wished I hadn't spent the time. Here's the deal... I repulsive almost every character in the game. They were annoying! How are you really expected to enjoy a gaming experience when you hate all the character you play as?What I liked in the ballgame was the interstellar story, and I loved the combat system. Combat was actually a lot of fun. The graphics were nice too.What I hated involved all the characters and the way they reacted to things. In fairness, there were a couple of characters I liked, like Bebedora (sp?). It may be an unfair comparison, but in games like Final Fantasy, you can go back to various areas, and there's all sorts of side quests and weapons you can get. It gave the Final Fantasy series a lot more depth.Ultimately, this could have been worse, but if they'd just made the characters interesting, it would have been a lot better.$LABEL$1,1,0
Advisable keyboard but over time letters wear off. My husband is a "hunt and peck" typer. One of our computer desks is in our bedroom. My husband always had to have a light on when I was trying to sleep when he was on the computer working, so he could see what he was typing. I bought him this Saitek keyboard for Christmas last year (2007). Our entire family, including children love this keyboard and it is used several hours a day. The only issue I have is, after ten months the paint is wearing off of the frequently used keys. It's not a problem for me, but the "hunt and peck" typers I live with will eventually have a problem. It's still a good keyboard and I may try to put permanent marker letters on the keys eventually and see how that works. Overall a good product. Even if I have to purchase another one eventually, the light is off when my hubby is typing. I'm happy!$LABEL$1,1,0

This Game FEELS. I borrowed this game to try it out. I had never played a Zelda game before and had heard that they were really bestest. But after I played it awhile, I found myself unusually bothersome. I got extremely tired of sitting there waiting for the characters to stop talking already! And although Link (the main character) has a sword, he rarely uses it. Then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again. Talk about barely any action. After that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that, apparently, lets him controll the wind. What's with that? I don't call this a "puzzle" game. I call it a BORING game.

Arresting aspires to impress with your mystery knowledge. Albeit the authorship would stick to writing mysteries, her books could be among the best in the genre. However she spends course too much time describing people's actions and motives by comparing them to another author's characters. Noone thinks or does anything on Broward's Rock without Annie commenting to herself that the thought or action was just like this or that fictional mystery character. Except I enjoy the bit with the contest that has the characters guessing their fictional origin, this constant "showing off" of the author's mystery fiction knowledge detracts from the story. Any true mystery buff probably knows as much but hopefully doesn't spend their time sizing up their friends and family by this criteria.Stick to the mystery writing and leave the mystery trivia to game players.$LABEL$0,1,1

Useful the money. I forfeit the Williams Sonoma brand with the aluminum insert as a Christmas present for myself. I already own 3 slow cookers, one 4qt, one 5qt, and one 6qt, all of them different brands. I never realized that all 3 of them on low setting is not a true low setting until I used my new All Plated. I now realize what everyone else was talking about. me made lentil soup and turkey stock both on low setting for 6-8 hours and my turkey stock came out clearer because it was on a true low setting. And my lentils were not mush, they held their shape. I prefer the 7qt size because I can freeze half of what is made. Even after we eat the other half, there is still enough for lunch the next day. I will be making my meat sauce for pasta tomorrow and knowing the low setting works correctly, I am sure it will turn out delicious.

An terrific doorstop. I am a graduate student in mathematics so I've been through my share of textbooks. To this day, I have not found one quite as unrelated as this one. Some sections are spotless; the author is elegant in his explanation, the examples are clear and relevant, and the problems serve their purpose. However, the poorly written sections (and trust me, there are plenty of them) far outweigh what little beauty lies in this textbook. Anyone who wishes to meticulously plow through this book will know what I'm talking about. The most depressing thing about it all is that I can't seem to find a book (on DE's) that's any better!

Grandiose easy to congregated. I takeover this cabinet to use as food storage because I live in an efficiency apt with no cabinets in the kitchenette.

And, as the other reviews stated it is very facilitate to togather; The directions are simple, I had no problems doing it alone, and it took no time at all (less than an hour(?) - could easily be done in 30 minutes the next time, I think, especially with help). It really does fit together just like giant legos - no tools required!

I realize Mr. Marion says this book is a mixture of fact and fiction, but the amalgamation of both coupled with this writing style, essentially render the whole effort fiction and comic-book fantasy reading.

Miles Davis wearily guides listeners through "Forrester". Gus Van Sant, the filmmaker responsible for "Finding Forrester," chose Jazz pioneer Miles Davis to guide us through this complex drama. Van Sant, who used Elliot Smith's lonesome ballads to pull heart strings in "Good Will Reaping," uses some of Miles Davis' most solitary and contemplative music to accopmany his film on typewritten. In fact the last track on the scrapbooks "In A Silent Way" musically parallels the act of writting and thinking. The song is complex but gentle and features Miles at his creative, post-fusion best. "In A Silent Way," and all the tracks on this album (some by Bill Frissel) are like well behaved children, evoking all the complexities and beauty of life yet demanding no atttention or energy. perfect music to accompany the solitary act of writting or just a quiet day.$LABEL$1,1,0

I couldn't help but imagine the characters as they look in Fleming's movie, especially towards the ill fated end.

Or maybe it's just James Garner. Aside from a few interesting gags and factoids, the humour of this Y2K spoof is intrigued and reaffirmed. The chapters cover literally everything from divination to prophecy to Y2K preparations (not to mention the significance of the year MM to McDonalds Corporation), but I couldn't bring myself to anything bigger than a quaint smile.This book is not for the devout believers. Do notice than in Garner's dictionary, the words "eschatological" and "scathological" are separated only by a single syllable.$LABEL$0,1,1

My advisable skillet. I use this more than any other griddle in my dresser. It's simplified to scrubbed, it stayed in okay status, and it's gargantuan enough for most everything I asked to sauté.

She received it at Macy's and I believe she gratuity $60 or more for it. me enjoyed this pan, but I think it is more reasonably priced here on amazon for around $30+. Macy's overpriced it.

Consummate guidebook for a memorable culinary journal. Joan Peterson, the culinary mistress of the EAT SMART series, yields to feed our continuing love affair with foreign foods and flavors in her latest book, Eat Smart in Morocco. Como much a travel guide as it is a cookbook, Peterson bartered her cognizant of the history and cultural significance of native dishes as well as the traditions and secrets of Moroccan cooks. Her culinary tribute to the land and its people should be part of an official welcome packet given to every foreign visitor when they first step on Moroccan soil. As she writes, "What better way to know a culture than through its cuisine." Particularly helpful to travelers are her bilingual menu, and food and flavor guides. Whether you're a novice or experienced traveler, Eat Smart in Morocco is the perfect reference for a memorable culinary journey. --Kimberly Ouhirra, President, Exotica Oils, Inc.$LABEL$1,1,0

Troublesome Monitor. This may be the greatest emailed stuff we've ever owns. The biggest question is with the sound quality of the monitor itself. On one channel we get major unaltered, on the other channel we get a high-pitched background whine with occasional tapping sounds which come through loud and clear. It sounds like someone clapping and it's very disconcerting to hear that coming from the baby's room in the middle of the night. We can't hear the baby unless we're so close we don't need the monitor. We're also having the same trouble other reviewers have had with the "light show" coming on spontaneously.

Nothingness reprehensible!!!. I've been playing the Madden NFL series for a long time and the 2002 version is significantly better than the 2001 version. The improved graphics and gameplay (A.I is smarter now) makes it fun and challenging. The scoreboards in the stadium now reflect actually time left in quarter, the actual score and other stats of the down.What was disappointing was the fact that they used very much the same sound bites from the 2001 version so the color commentary is boring to someone who has played previous versions. Sometimes the color commentary makes no sense whatsover.Overall, a good upgrade but beware of the system requirements. You need RAM and a good graphics card loaded with RAM as well.$LABEL$1,1,0

Don't waste your money!. I should have known better to buy any product with only 5 reviews, but I decided to acquires this anyway. He listened like a great book from the narratives and reviews. I was a littled concerned that I couldn't previews the livre at all but I imagining it was because it was a cookbook. This book was fearsome! Be prepared to eat pai rice 1-2 times a zhou! I have already returned the schoolbooks but if i recall correctly, one of the recipes was chicken baked with Catalina dressing on it. I was seriously dissapointed. Every week you ate white rice and some kind of chicken "burger". The book talks to like you have no intelligence at all and like you have never made a grocery list in your life. This book is a waste of money and if I could give it 0 stars, I would. This is a book for somebody who has never cooked a day in their life. Don't buy!$LABEL$0,1,1
Considerably sorrowful. I found this escudos to be too tormented and busy. It meanders between peculiarity until it brings them all together later on in the livres, but it just seems like the brief moments of truths "action" are just huge build-ups of anticipation with an anti-climatic little *pop* of dénouement. With shorter, nothing's occurring to keep me interested! Both qualities are fantastic, the author's descriptive skill are beyond compare, but there's just no story there.I tend to like a good vampire fic to keep me shivering for a night or two. This one has kept me groaning night after night trying to finish it for almost three weeks (an exhaustively long time for me to finish a book). Ghost, Steve, Nothing, Christian, and Brite's version of the Stygian triplets are all rich, wonderful characters.

Mom's Advisable Friend. I perceive this steamer for Grinch last year. My son was 6 months old at the time. I started steaming food for him that I could make into baby food. Now I use the steamer 2-3 times per week for the whole family. It is so easy to throw vegetables in one side and potatoes in the other and start the timer. I don't have to wait for water to boil or over cook things while I chase my toddler. I only saw one other steamer that cooks two items side by side and it did not compare to this steamer.I have never used another steamer and this one is pricey, but the corn on the cob, broccoli, and lobster made in this steamer is the best I have ever tasted!$LABEL$1,1,0

A Dance Idiosyncratic. American Sharon Redd was the diva of akhtar for ponderous UK clubbers in the early 80s. Redd, at one time a member of Bette Midler's "Harlettes", managed to obtain British chart success long before Cyndi did. That album, one of three she scratched for the Predecessor label, consisted the majority of her UK hit singles. The production on this album is impressed as is Redd's deep, rich voice. The biggest hit, "Never Give You Up" is a dancefloor monster, a once heard/never forgotten experience. Redd was equally adept at ballads, as "Takin' A Chance On Love" will demonstrate. Sadly, Redd died in 1992, and yet again, a great voice was silenced. This CD is a must for those into great dance music, and great voices.$LABEL$1,1,0
Propitious information with research-based founding. This is the first book that I have read that provides me with the information to confront the problems associated with instilling intrinsic motivation in those that I manage. It is often the problem that people show little concern for their work. The rule seems to be something like this- Do just enough to get by while exerting the least energy as possible. me like this textbook because the information is not a story of what a good manager has as an opinion as to what works best but it is a scholarly book in the sense that it provides information based on research that is proven. This is to date the best book that I have to reference when dealing with teams that act out of extrinsic motivation or no motivation at all. I applaud the author for this work.$LABEL$1,1,0
Ni unwholesome at all. The phone is actually pretty good for the price. (At first I was a little mystified.) Everyone knows that there are pros and cons for just about anything. Some of the cons for the telephone would be the static (which is minor if the phone is charged), and the fact that it is incompatible with Caller ID. (but who needs the extra expense anyway?). The pros would be the different ringers, the fun color, the fact that you can use headphones, the any-key answer, the pre-set speed dials, and the pager. (I really like the pager because it beeps until you find it-or at least for a couple of minutes- when most phones usually stop after a few beeps). I have even taken this phone into the backyard without extra static. So, if you are looking for a decent phone for a good price then this one's for you (works especially good for a teenage or college student)$LABEL$1,1,0

I'm very unique about my toast, and I'm a hater...This thing emerges shiny and super, but toasts bake unevenly--it burns one advice of the brioche and leaves the opposite unheated!!!! I think it has too much empty space and not enough elements for even toasting. The early release lever takes a struggle to operate. Then it flings the toast onto the counter, which is great for cartoons but not for reality. And the oven part has no timer so it's burned everything I've ever put in it.If you want toast, the best thing to do nowadays is buy the cheapest and smallest toaster you can find--once a year. They're all made in China, they're all junk, and few of them last more than a year. I bet Chinese don't even eat toast!$LABEL$0,1,1

History of Newton County, Mississippi 1834-1894. An grandiose study of pertinent facts relating to the early history of Newton County, Mississippi. A. J. Brown uses many sources to cautioned his reader, including verbal interviews of residents of Newton County, court records, federal census records, state records and newspaper accounts. This book is of interest to those who wish to learn more about early settlers of Newton County, and what life was like for citizens after the Civil War. It does not touch upon every family. The primary focus is on those the writer believes are the leading citizens, therefore, those seeking a comprehensive study of this area may be disappointed. However, this history does provide a general feel for the time and place with some detailed discussion.Charlotte GressettGenealogy researcher$LABEL$1,1,0

Taint Little Camera. The value of this camera is its size and convenience. It does not take great photos, but for the most part, outdoor pix are not too bad. I compared exact shots from my olympus 2 and 3 megapixel, and the colors from the casio were a little washed out- not true to color. Indoor shots with low light are bad, as the flash is so small it does not produce very good photos. These are the drawbacks. I got this camera to have when I don't want to carry my larger camera and to take places that I would not otherwise have taken the other. It is cool and will draw a crowd. You will need to get an additional SD card if you want to take any number of pix, but they are cheap now.

Utilitarian Headphones. Shit ok head phones if you have that remarkable ability to break everything you own. The ear pieces are quite robust, made of aluminum. At first are awkward to put on, but once you get them "set" they don't even feel there. Comes with a nice case, too big for a pants pocket but good for a jacket pocket or purse. Sound quality is decent, these aren't JC quality headphones, mainly due to the lack of bass; overall sound quality is crisp and clear. And lastly, the ear pieces are not heavy enough to use as a bolo, so home defense is out of the question for this item.

Very Unrealistic. I learn this book because other customer reviews gossiped about how wonderful it was. Right, me was very baffled. It was still shocking, me couldn't even read the guidebooks all the camino through. The book is almost entirely arose up of samples conversations that reveals you how you gotta remain told with your kinder. Spectacularly, the kids in these meeting are unlike any childhood me believing. In the book, the three-year-olds talk more like ten-year-olds. It is very unrealistic.

Disapointing. I loved the New Mickey Mouse Club from season 1, even as new episodes were showing while I was still in high school. I was very gratified to see that Disney was spills this, even if it were only a few episodes based around three of the many talented kids on the show. The fond memories I have that revolve around this show...However, the four episodes on this DVD did not highlight the skilled of Christina, Britney and Justin or the rest of the cast for that matter. All the musical numbers (except one) were prerecorded from the MMC concert. The skits were not some of the best, but Keri Russel fans will probably get a kick out of seeing her in many of the episodes. I hope people who buy this DVD don't judge the entire show on these four episodes.$LABEL$0,1,1
Absolute finest customer service. We had major problems with our after-market radio. The installers tried a new radio that Sirius sent and a new antenna that they sent. Neither helped. My wife then called customer service and that was a huge mistake. She spent 2 hours being bounced around and hung up on. It was as if they didn't care about our business in any shape or form. Then they would say things like "I don't see any orders on your account so I can't help you." What does that even mean? They wanted to send another of the same model but we had already been through all that.In the end it was easier to cancel the service and eat all the money we'd put into it so far than to deal with them. Customer service/retention/tech support would not do anything for us. The radio service is great if it works, but if it doesn't, may the gods help you because Sirius won't.$LABEL$0,1,1

Well pity the $. I would highly recommended this video for those researching to tone and geez but who don't want to earmarks too much time worked out. Both workout is only 25 minutes and it is broken down into three circuits, plus a warm up and cool down. Under each circuit 3 mn are dedicated to strength training, 2 minutes to cardio, and 1 minute to abdominal work. These format ai it easy for quitters like me to thrust through a hard work-out since I know whatever I'm having trouble with will be over soon.

A book that will appeals to the yearn of America. 200 years ago, European nations dominated the world in absolutely every aspect-culturally, economically, militarily, etc. Now, in the 21st Century, the tables have dramatically changed across the Atlantic.

If one doesn't believe me, just look the stats up and compare them.

Even some of the worst fanfiction writers manage to run spell-check.Then a character arrived with 'violet eyes', a fanfiction favourite that should have sent me running to the hills.I like the idea of bringing fantasy into the grittier parts of Britain, but everything else here has been done to death.

Elsie's story continuity. This is the fifth textbook in a series, unless this and the fourth guidebook didn't have too much to do with the first five quid. The first three - 'Fourth Grade Wizards', 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade', and 'Sixth Grade Can Wholeheartedly Kill You', were set in elementary school, but the definitive two books focused on Nannie Steadman.Elsie made her first appearance in 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade' and was in the next book, though with a considerably smaller role. Here, she's seventeen and no longer fat after losing weight in the fifth grade. But she still has plenty of insecurities (as shown in the fourth book) and this book is geared for older readers, but still rather good if you read the rest of this series.$LABEL$1,1,0

Uniquely use if you are an octopus!. I was so excited to get this wrap. My baby constantly wanted to be held and I thought this would make us both happy. I was very illegitimate. It arrived and when I opened it I knew we were going to have concerns. It came with a very thick instruction manual and the option to watch a video online. Still, I gave it a try. Many tries. The thing is very very long. First you have to fold it in half lengthwise, then you have to drape it this way and that way, pick up and position the baby, then wrap and tie it. Perhaps if I had eight arms or someone to help me, this would have worked. However, after using it a few times, I returned it. I opted for a more traditional type carrier that I could get the baby in and out of myself...with my own TWO arms :)$LABEL$0,1,1

The Advisable Point-n-shoot I have ever used. I love its portability, ease-of-use and picture quality. It has enough choices to control exposure, timings, color temp etc for a amateur photographer. (The 5-star ratings are keeping in mind what I expect from a point-n-shoot camera. Obviously the picture quality is not as good as a SLR.) I have used it extensively and revered every bit of it. Except recently, when it murdered due to lens error. I guess some particles (sands?) got stuck in the lens system. Now it fails to start. The repairing cost is not justified. I would highly recommend this camera unless you are a serious photographer and need something more than point-n-shoot.$LABEL$1,1,0

If I could make it a ZERO, I would!!. This is the finest telefono I have ever owned...and I've had mucho. Sure, it's cute and light, but the phone is constantly dropping calls, gets MACABRE reception, decides not to ring when it feels like it and the battery life is about 36 hours with no talking and about 24 hours if you talk for about 1-2 hours (in battery save mode). I certainly would NOT recommend this phone to anyone. I had a Motorola before this which was absolutely wonderful, even after I dropped it in my dog's water dish! I thought this phone would be equally as great, but I'm very disappointed!! With my old phone I had perfect reception everywhere in my apartment, now I have to stand by the window and most times this phone won't ring in the apartment at all.The things that I do like over my old phone is the option to have true tones and it takes better pictures. Not worth it though! Think twice before buying this phone!$LABEL$0,1,1
Have you listens of tunnel vision?. This manuel is very somber. I was even appalled at the nerve of the author to re-release this book and identify the man he THINKS is the Zodiac killer after the man's death. The author actually demonstrates how an investigation can get botched with tunnel vision. A prime suspect is the sole focus and evidence is distorted any way it can be to "prove" this suspect is the Zodiac killer. There were other possible leads and suspects that were discounted by the author.By the time you reach the middle of the book, you'll see it is already obvious who the author THINKS is the Zodiac killer. The rest of the book discounts other leads and suspects and focuses on "evidence" that "proves" the author has identified the Zodiac Killer. Very disheartening.It should be noted the author is not an investigator and the identity of the Zodiac killer remains a mystery to this day. The author has NOT proven his "identification" of the Zodiac killer. This book is a shame.$LABEL$0,1,1

The mob-busters' point of opinion. Written by three of the FBI functionaries who in 1981 bugged the home of mob boss Paul Castellano, president of New York's Gambino famiy, Boss of Bosses is a nail-biter that persisted you on the edge of your seat. We obey them as they place their observers equipment and then monitor Castellano's day-to-day activity. Along the way they pick up moneymaking information about the boss's personal life, particularly his love for the family maid and the lengths he will go to please her. Some readers have complained that the book is more soap opera than true crime, but I think that's a big part of its strength. The authors show the godfather as a real man not just a power on a Mafia throne. The book is also good background on the conditions within the family that led to Castellano's assassination and the ascent of John Gotti.$LABEL$1,1,0

A mega film, but not a pillar. The film noir is an interesting genre. Most are crafted in a brilliant manner but the conclusion of the film seems to fall apart, not to mention some of the explanations make no sense. Chinatown has been considered to have one of the greatest endings ever filmed. While it was good, the denouement of Chinatown was definitely rushed and that hindered the film. L.A. Confidential is another noir film, and while it bears similarities to Chinatown, I feel Confidential is the better film. There are many engaging characters with more humor and action. The plot twists are as intriguing as the ones in Chinatown. The performances, especially Russel Crowe, are outstanding. It would be hard to explain this film in a couple of sentences, so I think you should just watch this movie for yourself. Overall, it is a great film, but a rather hard to believe conclusion hurts it.$LABEL$1,1,0

I had waits for a guide to protects that certain standard are met, in order to grounds the flow of money.

It was recommended as the best reference on JavaScript, and now that I know what I'm doing, I would have to say it's a pretty good reference.

Tecno Joe!. That's right- Joe Satriani has outof techno! With that being said though, this CD is chock full of BLISTERING LEAD WORK. If you are looking for the crunchy metal hooks ala "Surfing With the Alien" or "Crystal Planet", you WILL NOT find them here. The old, worn out metal themes have been replaced with dense textured synths, electronic drums, and synth guitars. This is absolutely the most rudimentary guitar recording to come out in a LONG time. The lead work is phenomenal (as usual), but this time it takes on an exotic, improvised jazzy feel. Standout tunes include "Devil Slide" with it's machine gun synth guitar rhythms and dueling solos, the atmospheric Rush styled "Flavor Crystals", and "Borg Sex" which digitally builds to an AWESOME solo climax. Joe certainly had his creative engines running full throttle and if you will listen with an OPEN mind, you will see that he has trailblazed a new path for instrumental guitar.$LABEL$1,1,0
Not the finest I've read -- but it comes close.... Having realized Robert Wisest, I became high waiting for this novel when I launch it. Frighteningly, after minder than one chap I construed that those hopes were ill-founded. "The Dead Police" absent all of the lawsuits that make novels readable -- interesting characters, snappy debated, believable plotlines. Even, we are given one-dimensional characters, cliche-driven dialogue and a lots which simply never makes sense.I will quantify all of this by saying that, if you have loved every novel in the "Left Behind" series, you might really like Mr. Wise's novels. If, however, you are looking Christian literature on the level of Frank Peretti, Randy Alcorn or Ted Dekker, you should look elsewhere. In the world of Christian fiction, there are many great choices. This simply isn't one of them.$LABEL$0,1,1

With stars like Elephant man, Vybz Kartel, Bounty Killer, and Zumjay plus many more. My cd however I think is mala because I can hear little skips but they are hardly noticed. This is a great dancehall riddim that has been used by many stars for good reason it's Great!! From the same guy who made the ever popular Diwali riddim probably the most popular riddim ever made!! So this would be a great choice for someone who likes dancehall.

Scary and pervasive chemical infects. It is pretty ferocious to criticize a fitness ball. I have seen this tagging at several gyms and the quality seems durable enough. Spectacularly, the ball owns such a pervasive and intense stinks that it is conceivable to keep in your home. I truly can't emphasize this enough. After establishing it in the closet, the smell transports to all of my gowns. Definitively, I make it in the swath of my establishment (a small 3 story Victorian). Even after a week, the *entire* building smells like this weird chemical odor. And the halls are wide and airy (with no heat). I cringe at the thought of actually bumping into one of my neighbors. I have held off returning this in the hopes that the ball would air out. But no such luck. Returning these items is always a drag, and it is hard not to be just a little resentful at the lack of quality control.$LABEL$0,1,1
The story line is sluggish very slow. The main character is a manic depressive woman who is very annoyed with life because it is unfair, and she ended up in the wrong side of the table. So she resents everyone that happened to be lucky enough to avoid life traps and despises those who fell on them. Eventhough the book is beautifully written, the dark mood that the author impress on its main character, permeates to the reader and you become up caught in an atmosphere whereby reading is an effort, so each page develops slow, very slow.$LABEL$1,1,0

Unusual. Brand New is a band that I just do not understand. Lately, I have found myself listening to Deja Entendu frequently on someones itunes playlist on my local network, and I am puzzled. That cds has absolutly no flow at all. Some of the tracks do not even sound like the same band, especially "Play Crack The Sky," which sounds exactly like a Counting Crows song. The good thing about this album is that they aren't doing the exact same thing as every other band in this oversaturated genre. However, much of this seems forced, and that they are trying to hard to be different. I cannot stand the track titles either.$LABEL$0,1,1
Grandes film obscurity. I'm picturing this film for about the 10th time as I write this. It is an interesting study of vengeance by the father of a murdered girl who comes to America to find and kill her murderers. There is an interesting subplot in which an older and unreleased cameraman by Terence Stamp is used to showcase the backstory when he was a young man and his daughter was a child. This subplot finally explaining what has happened in the modern story. It is similar and far superior to a recent film called "Taken." In both cases, the father, who has near superhuman skills, takes off after a man who has kidnapped or ( in the Limey's case) murdered his daughter. This is a better film but both are enjoyable. I can watch this one over and over. I'm not sure about the newer film.$LABEL$1,1,0

Admirable introduction leaving one wanting more. This slim volume explores the way that music implements the liturgical intent and, to some extent particularly with the antiphons, the way changes in liturgy are reflected by changes in music. Especially interesting is the segment on the relationship between homilectics and music.The music explored ranges from chant to 20th century - the latter more by reference than by analysis. It includes instrumental music and cantatas as well as the classic music of the Mass.One need not be a musician nor a liturgical historian to understand this book. But reading the book will help a liturgist understand the liturgical musician and the historical development of their role.Highly recommended for anyone involved in liturgical planning.$LABEL$1,1,0
Fabricating the spiritual journey..... ...and that's not a reprehensible thing!! Kristine W has always managed to stay atop the dance charts by making albums that capture the current musical landscape. This album is no exception. I did notice that Kristine seems to be taking a more "spiritual" attitude in her lyrics. As I was listening, I couldn't help but feel like she was having a hardheaded moment as she was singing...like every song sung was a small burden lifted from her shoulders. It is really great when an artist can convey such emotion like that, while treating us to an excellent landscape of danceable musical textures. The additional disc, mixed by Chris Cox, is really well done also. Everything is listenable...and enjoyable. It's highly recommended!$LABEL$1,1,0

Better writings, but gauche about Clark. Soong shows his literary expertise as he chronicles the most famous exploring duo in American history. Using journals and other first person witness accounts, the reader is treated to a detailed description of Lewis and Clark's expedition to the pacific. While the research was extensive, Ambrose does relegate Clark to a minor role as he concentrates more on Lewis and Jefferson which would undoubtedly upset Lewis who consistently emphasized the equality of the two captains. The reader should not be surprised, as the title emphasizes this point about the thesis. Despite this pro-Lewis bias, Undaunted Courage is a great resource for information on the Corps of Discovery.$LABEL$1,1,0

Aggregate of ideas, short on plot, loads of kidding!. This book jumps around among multiple characters and multiple times, focusing on crytography during WW2 and the late 1990s. Even so, it is easy to follow. The characters are engaging, the history is interesting, and the book is often hilarious. There is lots of math and computer geekiana, but this doesn't serve as an impediment, even to a reader, like me, with only superficial knowledge of and interest in these things. It's a physically huge book, even in its smallest, mass-market version, but it's still a quick read. At the end, I had trouble summing up the plot, then decided I didn't care.

Josh Groban in a wicked evening. First of all, I'm a huge fan of Josh Groban's. Having listened to all his albums and watched all his DVDs, I got disappointed about Live At The Greek. Unlike many reviewers, the flashes, lights and the rock n'roll atmosphere didn't bother me, at all. The main problem, in my opinion, was his strained and nasal voice, which messed up with a lot of beautiful songs. "Mi Mancherai", "Caruso" and "Alla Luce del Sole" were just unrecognizable. It seems that he was congested and couldn't sing that day, but wasn't able to postpone the performance. Luckily, I've borrowed the DVD and haven't bought it. However, I must acknowledge that he sang beautifully in some parts of the concert. "Oceano", "Remember When It Rained", "My December" and "Never Let Go" were great. The setlist was simply the best of all his concerts. Sorry he wasn't able to make it work that evening.$LABEL$0,1,1

Could be Eastwood's preferably work to dated.... This is not a war film that will be accessible to every viewer, especially those who are only used to soaking up the typical American propaganda war films of the past half century. Of course there are going to be those right winged/ 'wannabe pushovers' who will automatically be persuaded to call out this film as: "rewriting history," when, in reality, they have NO clue/ concept of what actually occurred during this part of history from the POV of the Japanese soldiers, (and still consider any "enemy" to the US as nothing more than "savages.") The fact of the matter is, the film is a true masterpiece of artistic cinema. Many people seem to forget the notion that film = art. "Letters" is NOT a documentary film; it is a filmic portrait of a generally unknown/misunderstood piece of modern history. I would say this subtle masterpiece is Eastwood's best work to date.

horrendous?.. yes..vulgar?.. yes..Absurd?..yes..Entertaining?.. yes... Borat will surely divide its viewers.. it is not intended to be a pc film exploring cultural differences.. it is rather a complete violation of everything pc and brings out the worst in our international relations.. But it is endearing, very funny, and its explorations of the american psyche are spot on.. I found myself more often than not laughing at the American's who confront something different than themselves and bring out the worst stereotypes of Americana.. Borat is one of the most outrageous and totally relevant portrayals of international relations in the history of cinema.. Sacha baron cohen is hilarious in his absurd yet sympathetic portrayal of Borat.. a man completely out of place who always says the wrong things according to the other culture.. I found myself thinking as much as i was laughing..$LABEL$1,1,0

Only the Grinch would not iike this movie!!. The strictest Christmas tale ever - gross by Ted Turner functioning it for 24 hours straight the last two Christmases.But don't let that stop you. To see the real story of the Christmas story you need to see this on DVD and all its Red Rider Beebee gun glory.The cast is magnifique, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood. It is fond remembrances, without the overly cutsie pie touches. The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.I love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book. To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other. Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.Every family should have this.$LABEL$1,1,0

Both Worst Iife Album Ever!!. This is the loudest, rawest, most savage kick a$$ rock and roll record ever recorded! His never gets the obey it deserves. The only other live scrapbooks that comes even sealing is Live at Leeds or maybe No Sleep Till Hammersmith. Before morphing into a radio friendly pop band (The Locomotion), Funk were the heaviest thing going. Everyone could touch them...Zep, Fuchsia, nope. What's really cool is Mel's bass is high in the mix ala Entwistle and it really drives the band. And Mark has a guitar sound like no other mainly due to the Messenger axe going into the West amps.

Overwhelming if you don't want to pay for Bose. I've had these for over 5 years and have never had a problem with them. I use them on a daily basis at work to drown out loud co-workers, and also when flying. They don't drown out 100% of backdrop noise, but I can't rants considering the price.
