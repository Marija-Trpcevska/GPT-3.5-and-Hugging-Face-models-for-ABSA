Unaccounted pin?. Maybe I'm just imbecilic and should gets exerted this from the acronyms in the foodstuffs description, but there is a pin that is not wires in this cable. This pin happens to be the signal that tells my laptop hardware info on the monitor I attach to... appropriately when I hook this cable to my Samsung DLP HDTV that has a VGA port, my laptop can only assume its a generic VGA monitor and displays in colonize that don't fit on my HDTV (like 1024x768.) I tried another VGA cable I had that has all the pins wired, and my laptop immediately recognizes the display as a Samsung HDTV and defaults to a 720p resolution. Since the purpose of purchasing this cable was to hook up to my HDTV, this cable is useless to me.$LABEL$0,1,1
Sound great but unsure. Hope not final.. I tried the cheaper in ear noise cancelling Sony earphones and they broke in a very short amount of time. I figured the more expensive version would be more durable. I WAS WRONG. These nailed in an even shorter amount of time - 2 weeks. $50 is a lot to spend on approachable headphones. I guess Sony makes all of their products disposable; portable CD-players, stereos, etc. Sony customer service also blows. Pray you'll never have to deal with them. Better yet, just don't buy Sony and go with Shure. It is more but worth it because it will last. Buy from a company that doesn't believe in disposable products.$LABEL$0,1,1

Just for serious Akkerman fans. I bought this as a CD in 2012, forgetting that I had owned it as a vinyl LP in the late 70s. If I had remembered, I would not have bought it again. I DO like the final 7 short songs of the album: some blues-rock that sounds improvised; also a jig and a couple medieval pieces that are cool but not as well developed as some similar works that appeared on Focus 3, Hamburger Concerto, and Akkerman's album Tabernakel. HOWEVER, the first cut, "Fresh Air", is a tedious, 20 minute example of one of those 1970s unsuccessful attempts to elevate rock music to a higher art form. Yes, there are some impressively-fast guitar licks which are instantly recognizable as Jan Akkerman. But, otherwise, I find the song unlistenable; beginning and end are dreary, noisy chaos in between. Quite a bipolar album!$LABEL$0,1,1

Don't start reading this series....

He is already about 4 years behind on the next installment (A Dance with Dragons), and two more novels are supposed to be added after that. Just on content, this book is worth 4 stars, but the lack of completion for the series ruins it.Also, be sure to note that the content is for adults only, with some sexually explicit material.It also seems that the latter books in the series tend to ramble, making me long for the more concise, action-oriented content of the first two books.$LABEL$0,1,1

Hitech - AC Adaptor Stopper (converts European plugs to US Outlets). We bought a small fan in Spain last summer to provide some ventilation in a small room some friends in Madrid were letting us use as we traveled around from one place to another. It was so efficient that we decided to make room for it in an extra suitcase we had to buy to get the things we acquired in Spain home. This adaptor plug acted just fine in doing what it was designed to do. However, be aware of the fact that your appliance without further adaptors to change the current from 110 to 220 will function at about half the speed! Of course, you could plug your appliance into a 220 outlet if you can figure out how to make that work.¡Buena suerte! (Good luck!)$LABEL$1,1,0

Richard is the Advisable. This isn't his best.. I use this and Sweatin' to the Oldies III. I love the music and dancing, however it is hard to follow this video because the camera isn't always on Richard at the beginning of a dance or when he changes steps. Head shots don't help with foot work. STTO III is more professional in this regard. At first I thought that this didn't provide as good a workout as STTO III, but my heart rate and sweat prove otherwise. I believe it is because these dances use your arms more. Richard is great for those of us who don't have perfect bodies and probably never will. Even though I am toned and losing weight, I will never look like Denise Austin or Kathy Ireland.

Nice looking, BUT perfectly touchy. I earned several of these frames and I had a lot of prints to devising and like d the clean lines, and low cost.I really like the look of floating glass frames, and it provides more options for your photos or art.The problem with these frames is that like plethora subjects made in Chine, they are cheap...at great cost.The glass broke from the compulsion of putting those little tabs that hold it together down, and (as someone who works with glass) I know that this type of break only occurs in glass which is not properly annealed.What does this mean to you? It is DANGEROUS!!! A product like this should be made with either safety glass, hard glass (pyrex, borosilicate) or, at the very least, properly annealed soft glass (actually any & all of these glasses should be annealed to remove stress)...but, without getting too technical- all I can say is that the glass in this product is unsuitable for it's purpose, and fundamentally unsafe.$LABEL$0,1,1

Shawna is infamous. I really loved this showcase through the first 3 duration. Once, the newer Paige properties is just unwatchable. Not only is she outrageous in that "I'm a teenager and I know everything" sort of way, she's even self-rightous and soooooo politically correct it's enough to swivel your stomach.And she doesn't fit. There's quite no chemistry between her and the other girls. None ever developed no matter how many season she was on the show.As if that's not bad enough, the scripts just got so incredibly dumb in season 4. I remember watching the first few episodes when it aired and all of us were groaning and rolling our eyes at the goody-goody two shoes approach the writers decided to take. It was like a film strip aimed at teaching third graders how to be good, in that really overbearing, obnoxious sort of way.Skip this one, stick with the first three seasons instead.$LABEL$0,1,1

over a thousand kiddos can't be fraudulent.... I was given this handbook as a gift more than 100 times now. I traditionally give it to graduates - both high school and colleges. As a teacher, I've assumed the opportunity to read this book to over a thousand trainees. Of course there have been students who didn't get it or who wanna elicit it and just didn't like the book, but most (supposedly over 80%) have wished the narration and learned something from it. I have also sent this book to people in some sort of trouble - jail or rehab type situations - and the gift has always been received with great enthusiasm. Personally, the book changed my life, as trite as that sounds. I keep hoping Oprah will discover and share it.$LABEL$1,1,0

Stylishly Pleasing. Great to look at -- in the tradition of Eraserhead or Freaks.But that's the troublesome aspect.

Grands freund when staring the series. I worshipped this book. I cited to it and make my own notes in it when I watch every episode so that someday I will have watched them all. One thing that I have a question about. That is regarding the few moments that were registering rather than filmed. The plaintiff proclaimed they were taped then transferred to 16mm photographed for broadcast. I just don't understand why they they wern't just broadcast from the original tape. This way they would not "look like a copy of something" rather than an original tape. You would think that with today's technology restoration could be made of these tapes to make them look other than a cheap Kinescope from the past. Otherwise, thanks for a great book.$LABEL$1,1,0

advisable invention ever for cat malik - but costly. I truthfully LOVE my scoop-free self-cleaning litter box. me can't think of a function I resent more than cleanup out the litter box, and now I can ignore it for two weeks. Altering the refill is quick and not too tumultuous. The recharge are invaluable, but to me, it's worth it to avoid dealing with cat litter on a normal foundation. I don't pinpoint the scent to be much of a problem, except a little in the summer.One other thing I'll mention is that the company has great customer service. When my first box stopped working, they were very responsive. First they sent some troubleshooting ideas, and when those didn't work, they sent a free replacement which came very quickly.So bottom line: I'd give it 5 stars if the refills were not quite so expensive, but other than that, it's a product I don't think I could live without anymore.$LABEL$1,1,0

A Tip on securing the Router Template Guide Adapter. A previous reviewer (i.e., Adrian) wrote that he had to tinker with it to attach it to his router. I tinkered, and tinkered with the adapter and couldn't get it attached. I even tried to call Bosch but it was after hours. Then I thought I would remove the base plate (it couldn't hurt, right?), and T.G. I did. Because there in lies the secret to attaching it--at least for me. Under the plate I discovered the spring tension latch which must be engaged for the template adapter to lock securely in place. I suspect this is what Adrian meant by his "fiddling", but did not elaborate for those who would follow him. But I have! So now, there should be no excuses. For you other people that are, like I was, ignorant of this latch, now you'll know,and be spared the frustration.Gosh, Adrian, it would have taken you just a minute to elaborate on this. :-)$LABEL$1,1,0

Compared to stock iPod phones, these are an improvement, but absolutely nothing compared to "real" headphones: Ety er4p, Senn 280, Senn 580, Grado 80 (I own them all).The sound quality is quite mediocre, but I listen to it at such low volumes it hardly matters.At work I don't like sitting with full size phones and the etys, while superb, isolate me too much so these are a nice default.I use it in the office when I need a little bit of isolation from the background noise but not too much isolation so I cannot respond when someone asks me a question.... and they are shiny too..$LABEL$0,1,1

Hallucinatory story. This story is decidedly captivating. The author is a man who is unable to communicate except for his ability to blink one eye. The entire book was dictated in this manner after having suffered a stroke. I read this handout from the psychology of a health professional and I found it to be too helpful for empathizing with the patient. It is important to remember that just as a patient cannot speak, does not midst that they are not really in their mind. I think this book would be a fascinating and useful read for both health professionals and lay persons.$LABEL$1,1,0
Was a great blog, frak primer. Salam Pax started out well. Then he got commercialized. The tone of his writing has changed dramatically, and the influence from the anti-war crowd has all but consumed his writing.I'd love to tune back in years from now after he's been forgotten, to see if he returned to writing from the heart.$LABEL$0,1,1

Advisable stepping of him. Mas Amedda was always one of the more interesting aliens in the prequels. This figure gets pretty high marks. The only thing I would like to see in a future update is a soft goods outer cloak. The hard plastic works well enough but limits articulation. Also, the soft goods would probably just look even more regal.$LABEL$1,1,0
