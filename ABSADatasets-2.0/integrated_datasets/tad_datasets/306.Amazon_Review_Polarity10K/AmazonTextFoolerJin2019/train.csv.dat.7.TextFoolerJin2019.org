Do yourself a favor, Check it out first. I would strongly urge anyone to check this product out before buying it.... This is one of the first we bought. It is very slow. Our bright enough baby was unable to establish any relationship between mouse movement and what happens on screen. The characters talk to the baby and tell her or him what to do. Babies do not get it. Our baby is now a toddler and this softwere is still useless. I suggest Reader Rabbit Baby, Reader Rabbit Toddler, or Sesame Street Baby and ME. Stay away from Sasame Street Toddler. It is very old, probably a Windows 3.1 progrem that needs a lot of updating.$LABEL$0,0,-100

dragged me in. I can't say enough about this book...and its successor The Glorious Cause. This book is what dragged in me to try to join DAR and learn all I could about the birth of our nation.Jeff tells this all in a voice that is not condescending but informs while entertaining. I feel these books are a must for any American History class or history buff. As a matter of fact I think all Americans, or those wanting to be should read these and understand the odds, the struggles, the remote chance that any rag-tag army could defeat the most formidable army on earth at the time!Exceedingly well written; I could not put it down and had to wait for The Glorious Cause!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not Recommended for the Serious Backpacker. I wouldn't recommend this book for the experienced backpacker or experienced dog owner. The author of the book writes regularly for Dog Fancy... fine publication I am sure, but neither myself nor my dog are particularly fancy. The information is overly broad (though I don't know what I expected for the price) and is not really applicable for anything other than the casual weekend trip or car-camp.If you are anything resembling a regular backcountry traveler who enjoys the companionship and security of your mongrel and are looking practical tips on how to keep your dog healthy, safe and happy on the trail, look at other publications.If you have a monthly subscription to Dog Fancy and a collection of brand new backpacking gear, this might just be the book for you.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Superb!. 'Hitler: the Last Ten Days" is a very realistic portrayal of Adolf Hitler's days in the Berlin bunker. Alec Guinness plays history's most famous evil goofball very convincingly. The film presents verified events in a very engaging manner. It's an expensive movie, but if you have any interest in Adolf Hitler you will find it well worth the price. A film like this makes one appreciate how incredible it is that a weirdo like Hitler could have risen so high and done so much damage to humanity. To sum it up in three words-buy this movie!$LABEL$1,0,-100
fantastic. The only fault I find in this series (Outlander)is the length of time between books. The last one came out in 2009, the next book in the series won't be out for another year. Four years is pretty awful. The series itself, (that means every book in it) is one of the best series I have ever read. Each book is almost impossible to put down. Having said that I wish I hadn't bought the first one till the whole series was published.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Have I Heard This Song Before?. I like Alicia Keys, but I can always tell what artist she was listening to before she wrote/recorded this song. Even though I am young, I listen to music from the 50s, 60s and 70s. This song sounds a remake of an Aretha song with some Donny in it. In other words, this song is NOT original at all!! I do love the message of this song, but this sounds like a song I already heard before.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Still An Enriching Experience. They may have cut the overture and intermission, etc., but what was restored in the directors cut lengthens the original. And I don't really feel the previously edited songs enhance the experience. Just like my dislike of "Apocalypse Now Redux." A poor addition of far inferior scenes in my opinion. Fortunately, "1776" still remains a patriotic and historical delight. Almost like watching a stage production, another example of how film adaptations done right, can add to the limitations of stage scenery. Should be required viewing for school children of all ages.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Pretty but Not Sturdy. I bought this a year ago and have had it continually fall apart. It's very stylish and looks great, but the way the rack itself attaches to the wall mount is by one tiny little surface screw. The mount is secure in the wall, but the weight of the double towel rack bends the tiny screw its leaning on where it attaches to the wall-mount and falls down. I've even purchased larger surface screws that won't bend and that held it up for the past 6 months, but those are failing now too.Bottom line is that if you get a double rack (which is a worthy convenience) make sure to investigate how the rack attaches to the wall mount and that it is more than what you would use to attach a TP holder.Don't recommend this product, and subsequently the manufacturer.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Sharp and effective, but the release is in a bad place. The release to retract the blade for safe storage is a great idea.

Real Men Read Iron John. This book had been recommended to me for years. Finally, at the suggestion of my samuri sword teacher, I picked it up and read it in long sittings. What I like first and foremost about Iron John is that it combines memoir, translation, poetry, mythology and journalism all in one book and then delivers powerful messages about men's individuation from mother and journey into manhood. It not only provides a new vision of psychology and archetyping, but does so by dissecting the old, cross-culturally familiar "Wild Man." It helped me to better understand men's psychology and their initiation and rituals into manhood. It also provided me with thematic ideas to explore in my own fiction.$LABEL$1,0,-100

An Early DWJ Title. From the previous review I think this was the book published in the UK as Wilkins Tooth. It's a fun story about two children who run a 'Revenge Service' to make some pocket money. As you would expect in a childrens book the scheme backfires. It reminds me of 'Ogre Downstairs' as it's set in an apparently normal town where extra ordinary events occur. I'm not sure why it's been out of print for so long; many of the issues surrounding some bullies in the story could be helpful to schools today.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Nothing special. I really don't understand all the hype about this movie. I am a personal fan of musicals, so its not the genre that bothered me. It is an entertainig and well executed movie, but not much beyond that. It sort of tricks you into thinking that its a good movie when really its quite flat. It has no message or theme, and you can't really come to care about the characters. 20 minutes after I had left the theater I had forgotten all about the movie, definitely a sign of a bad movie.$LABEL$0,0,-100
WARNING! Not a Good Experience.. I purchased 5 thermocouples listed as "Honeywell #cq100a-1021 18" Thermocouple" and received 3 24" and 3 30" ALL of which had been previously opened, damaged, were missing parts, and poorly taped up. A couple even showed signs of use.....maybe the broken thermocouple returned to the store after a new one installed??? Either way I order 5 18" and didn't receive a SINGLE 18" and since the listing said NOTHING about used, damaged, opened, or parts missing products I rightfully assumed I was buying new product.The good news is they promptly refunded my money without any problems. Obviously they had had this problem before and were not surprised by my complaint. They did comment that they thought that is what I wanted..........NO, if I wanted 24" or 30" thermocouples that is what I would have ordered!! Overall a complete waste of my time and energy dealing with an incompetent and/or unethical seller. One star because ZERO is not an option.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A really good and supriseingly hard science fiction novel. A great start to Michael Stackpole's Battletech novels, this one serves as an introduction to the whole Clan invasion, and is great for any fan of Battetech.Battletech itself seems odd, as few people would guess that giant robots blasting each other would be a good example of hard science fiction yet the novels are a a vocabulary building exercise in hard science fiction with just faster then light travel and the prime conceit that giant robots are the kings of the battlefield as places where it strays from very hard science fiction.

Earlier Versions Definitely Better. While this is still a decent product, they have removed a number of the utilities that were offered in earlier versions. When I asked Norton about this, their response was "You can uninstall the new version and reinstall the old one," which is like saying, "Oh, well, guess you wasted your money when you upgraded!"

Any one episode of JL is better. Here was an opportunity to put a little more time and effort into an animated feature as compared to the half hour episodes of Justice League (basically handled by the same team). It was an opportunity missed. The only "added value" you get from this direct to video movie is some mild cussing. I guess throwing in some foul language makes it more "interesting" or "edgey"? Anyway, to get to the point, any half hour episode of J.L. is better than this movie. And if you watch the ads you'll see a season set on sale for $19.99 at various retail stores. Pick up a season set of J.L. instead of this missed opportunity.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Britney Bares Her...Soul. Poor Britney. No matter what she does, she's not going to get any respect from the critics. But In The Zone is as good as contemporary pop gets - it's fun, sexy, danceable and mature. Her voice is not a great instrument, but neither is Madonna's. What she is is expressive, sensual and energetic - she makes you feel what she wants you to feel. She had some great producers on this album, and it shows. It's probably a four star album, but I give Britney the extra star because I know she's going to take so many unfair shots from the haters. Which is too bad, because she's adorable and talented.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Mine got ruined quickly. At first I was very excited about these headphones, mostly because of the comfortable fit and the retractable cord. I really couldn't tell the difference when I had the noise cancelling on, but then I thought, hey, this has a retractable cord, it's worth it. Well, I only have had these headphones for a couple of months, and now the cord is damaged and the sound is terrible, even though I have consciously took good care of these headphones.

Sound The Alarm for a Great New Musical Force. Sound the Alarm is a powerfully strong EP. The band formerly known as Sleepwell has put together a melodic blend of cool vocals and strong harmonies that mix tempos punctuated by heavy explosive guitars. Most of the songs start out slower and build to intensity with a crescendo of great guitar breaks blended with smooth powerful vocals.All the tracks on this disc are great. The production is clean and crisp.Although most people hate comparisons, I would say their sound is somewhat similar to bands like: Name Taken, Just Surrender, Race the Sun, Acceptance and at times reminds me of As Tall as Lions. Fans of those bands should definitely check this out. All killer and no filler on this promising debut under their new moniker.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Revaluation of Values. I just have to ask: why is it that when a women has a torrid week of elicit aldulterous sex with another man she has found "the one true love of a lifetime," but if a man has a similar escapade, he is a shallow letcherous pig? The premise of this book is simply this: love is a blissful paradise which is at every turn impeded by such vile ecumbrances as committment, honesty, integrity and self-sacrifice. This book is the centerpeice of the vile "Oprah Syndrome" booklist. Intellectual depth is now merely a melange of "getting in touch with one's spirit," new-age psycho-babble and dizzy romantic love. To believe that such a book offers any intellectual substance is to assert with fervent honesty that one can survive a week's trek in the Sahara with only a glass of salt water and a stick of cotton candy.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Hitler buffs might own it; the curious should visit library. This book is disorganized and the various topics, although related, are not cemented together with anything resembling a well-thought out, well-written structure. In what direct way, for instance, are Hitler's water colors related to the circumstances of his death? This book's most important information (who found Hitler's body, how Hitler died, where Hitler was buried, something I found of particular interest) should have been summarized in a two-page weekly news magazine article somewhere. Obviously, however, the authors felt that to read their exclusive but well-padded research should cost at least $20 or so, therefore, here it is, in book form. History buffs may want this book for the inserts and for what few pages actually contain fresh, well-presented information, but the curious who just want to know more about Hitler's last days should visit their library or borrow a copy from a friend-- who, I'm sure, won't mind lending it out.$LABEL$0,0,-100

For one the game has no story line what so ever, and u really don't get involved in even your own character. Its just a bunch of pointless five minute adventures that lead to no where. You also have noo freedom of movement in the field world at all, its from one place to the next, no fighting. I'm sure all of your remember when your weapons get upgraded...well nope not in this game, which was one of my favorite options. Really i guess its the story line im disappointed in, i guess the first just won't be beat. I did have to give it two stars though because it gets kinda cool near the end when you get to do cool things with your "town".

Good Investment. I am very happy with this baby sling. It's a little intimidating at first because of all the straps, and I had to have my husband help me adjust it to fit. But all the straps make for a very secure fit.My newborn is very comfortable in this sling. She gets to lay close to me. We tested this out by going to the mall. The whole time baby slept comfortably and not once did my back start hurting. I was very comfortable the entire time and both baby and I felt secure.For me the sling is less trouble than a stroller at this point and has been a nice option.I would recommend this sling.

Shoulda paid more for something else.. I'm somewhat happy with this pressure cooker set. It takes a while to seal, and won't seal if it's not on high heat, so it's hard to make food you can burn, like rice. I think this is because it has safety features not found on old pressure cookers, but perhaps more expensive brands/models don't have this flaw. It's also hard to figure out how to use. The pressure valve label is confusing to some - the correct positioning is 180 opposite from what it appears. Only cooks at 8 psi and 12 psi, not 15 psi (250F), so it requires about 20% more cooking time (at 12 psi) than a 15 psi cooker. Didn't realize this when I bought it. For the $ I paid, it is OK. I wish I'd bought a better cooker; I'm pleased with the results.This is a copy of my review of theManttra Smart 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker.

MDR-NC60 Doesn't Cancel Noise well. I had a pair of Maxell MAX190400 noise canceling headphones that broke. Instead of replacing them I thought I would try other noise canceling headphones.

I work in an office that plays music that I don't like. I didn't expect total silence when wearing the Sony's, but the sound should be significantly decreased. However, I heard everything even though the NC feature was turned on. I just bought Maxell's HP/NCIV and they work much better and block out almost all noise. Don't waste your money and time with the Sony. If you really want noise cancellation get the Maxell.$LABEL$0,0,-100
This book makes me feel stupid. I was so disspointed with this book considering i read and enoyied Dubliners and Portrait of a Artist as a Young Man and it is on alot of best books of all time list. The reason i liked Joyce's previous work is that both are not too long, he was a good writer and i am against the catholic church so any book that critizes it is okay with me. With his other books you really did not mind the parts when nothing really happens and his heavy prose style. But trying to read Ulysses is such a chore you end up scratching your head and having to read passages over and over again untill you get it.

A must have for any video collection. This is one of the best concert videos I have ever seen. The concert footage is fantastic and it also contains stories about the band and their travels. The guys from Matchbox 20 tell the stories themselves and they are a very humorous bunch of guys. It brought back memories of the concert I went to, including the feelings of excitment and exhiliration that I felt on the night. It truly made me feel like I was back there again. An un-forgetable experience. I have this video in my collection and I suggest you should have it in yours.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Ehhh..... This is a well written and clever book, and the author is very talented. The thing is, I'm a little irritated and bored by the story of a 20-something, commitment phobic, seemingly adolescent kind of guy who is such an emotional midget that he can't even say "I love you." The protagonist reminds me of the quintessential young (immature) single guy whose self destructiveness is matched only by his narcissism...the kind of guy women (girls?) really go for until they get a little older and grow a backbone. Harry's a horrible jerk until she draws a line in the sand...then he realizes how much he cares and wants her back...have all of us not lived or heard this scenario in some way a zillion times since we began dating? Are we not tired of it yet? Maybe I'm getting old...it's just not very cute or alluring anymore...it was hard for me to sympathize and consequently hard for me to stop rolling my eyes.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Magnets damaged my Treo. Quite happy with the case, which I use in my pocket (I have the case without the belt clip), so the weak magnets are not a problem.The magnets did damage my Treo (scratches).

Awful. Being a big fan of prog-metal, and some prog-rock, I must say this was the stupidest excuse for music I have ever heard. If you like bands such as DT or even Spock's Beard, you'll be dissapointed. I have heard good things about this band, but they were obviously bias views. The entire album is eerie sound effects, that don't even come close to giving you that feeling of pure enjoyment. Music to me consists of a band utilizing their skills in song writing and playing their instruments, not making random creepy symphonic sounds with some lyrics. Only if you're interested in the traits in which I listed, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Dr. Wilds' magic.. Chuck Wilds music is the flux that will put you in touch with your inner self. I have an amazing connection with his compositions. In the late 70's when I lived in Orange County my wife and I used to drive down the coast on Highway 1 (PCH). We had friends in Laguna so we would always stop and visit or have lunch. One of those friends was Wyland. Invariably at some point in the day we would end up on the beach, usually late in the day at dusk. We would sit and play guitars for a while and then just lay on the beach and meditate as the sun went down. I now live on the other side of the country but every time I want to recapture that feeling I put on Chucks "Laguna Indigo" and in an instant Im back there. Thanks Chuck. God bless you for your kind soul and the sharing of your wonderful music. Namaste. NklSk@t (SadhuDhaya) Nashville, Tn.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Looks cool w/ iSight but is a huge disappointment. What you're paying for is the same thing as a cheap 40-watt desk lamp that can hardly light up a face in a dark room! Not only does the light hardly work, but the light casts you in a weird blue complexion, even in a well lit room. The ambient light sensor sounds like a good idea but doesn't really work that well (the light comes on even while in relatively well-lit rooms). Despite all of these shortcomings, the SightLight is very easy to install. Bottom line....Use an exsiting lamp or buy a cheap one on ebay.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great for carpet, not as great on hard surfaces or detail work. We've had our Sebo for 5-6 years and bought it for a fully carpeted house with very limited hardwood/tile. It was amazing, it is really an excellent vacuum with exceptional parts and performance on carpet. It does adjust to go on hardwood, but it doesn't really do a great job there, also, the standard attachements aren't designed to help you vacuum on any hard surface, just for occasional detail work (short reach, no hard floor attachment).

This book made me wet my pants - with laughter!. Are you looking for one of the craziest, out of whack books on any religious topic? Then you found the right book. Written by a former member trying to make his former faith look good, this author goes so far overboard one would have to be clinically insane to believe it - or to believe the religion found in it. I found my self crying at points I was laughing so hard at the insane ideas portrayed by this book. One has to admit, the author did a great job of creating a new religion.

When you are old and gray and full of sleep. . .. I know, Yeats--but listening once more to the Barry Lyndon soundtrack some 24 years after a first awestruck hearing has cast me back to my long-lamented lovestruck girlhood: what lost Celtic lass can listen to the Chieftan's version of WOMEN OF IRELAND without recalling Marissa Berensen reclining in her bath, and one's own shattered pilgrim soul. What a time it was to be caught up in Kubrick and Bach while my highschool mates played (what?) Mott the Hoople! I've hummed the song to my wee one every night for two years; finally I can play the lovely mix of passionate, rousing, and in turn melancholy tunes to him complete!

Maps and information missing. The Book includes a lot of hikes and nice spots on Maui but it was not a big help anyway. Some parts are written nicely, but this applies mostly to the car parts.The different hikes are not rated by difficulty and also no estimated time is given. Even worse is that maps of the hikes are missing so you lack orientation when you are on your way - I personally would even appreciate topographical maps - but not even knowing which trails I would cross or whether there were any alternative routs was very annoying. Furthermore description of the trail heads is unclear. Different hikes that are not alternative routes are described in the same chapter which makes reading confusing. All together I can not recommend this book, especially not as a full travel guide to Maui or as your only hiking guide there.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Fantastic writing. I got this book after I won a contest. I initally thought after reading the title blurb that it would be a boring yarn about an autistic boy and did not read this for about 2 months. Later as I ran out of good books to read , I started reading it & I couldnt put it down. Personally I prefer thrillers and whodunits but this book really hooked me in. The character development is fantastic. The way the book goes on through the perspective of the boy is great. I also read the Rule Of Four which tries to kill time by writing loads of rubbish about the characters.

Seems like a good idea, but don't trust the pre-taped rolls.. I've used window shrink wrap products many times before, and when I saw the pre-taped roll, I thought it might save me some time. It doesn't.1) The tape on top doesn't stick as well as it should, and the double-sided tape for the rest of the window doesn't stick well either.2) The roll itself bunches in on itself, meaning that you have to cut the film much wider than you'd think to prevent creating little zig-zag cut-outs in the space you want to cover.3) The film doesn't seem to shrink as wrinkle-free as other products I've used.4) This one is a little but my fault, but I trusted the height a little too much. The pre-taped top is actually part of the height, which meant that the bottom came out too short on the first window I did. Re-doing the whole thing made me a bit grumpy.I wouldn't buy anything that comes in a roll again.

Confused by Utterly Confused. I concur with Mr. K. Galligan's review above, I too spotted some of the same mistakes, moreover, on page 12 the author introduces the subject of Linking Verbs by using the term "predicate", although this is an introduction chapter and she has not yet defined what a predicate is, so for those who are unenlightened, or just learning grammar, they need to go to the index where they will find that the definition is on page 52, in chapter 4. I thought the approach illogical. One does not teach the basics by beginning with terms that have not yet been defined.The author begins the selection on verb tenses by explaining that there are six tenses in English, although another grammar book I consulted explains that there are in actuality twelve tenses altogether. The section on the distinction between "who" and "whom" was not particularly well explained either. For a grammar book that was supposed to help those who are utterly confused I found this book confusing.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not what we expected. before we ordered the Oster 6058 toaster oven, it sounded like it had everything we wanted. Wrong. When standing at normal height and loking down to a counter top it is imposible to read what each button does. There isn't ever a light behind the buttons nor is the printing easy enough to see. In the window at the top there are red bars with something printer above them which I still have not been able to read because the printing is about 1/16 of an inch and not even clear.

4 1/2 Stars-The People's Champ. Very good CD. I was very impressed by Paul Wall from the moment I heard him. I've never been a huge mark for the Houston music but Mike Jones I liked, Slim Thug's album i thought was garbage, and this Paul Wall I love. The beats are great, his lyrics are slick, and the overall presentation is very good, if you never saw this guy you wouldn't guess he was white. Paul is a big standout from the Houston crowd and now that he's on the mainstream I think he'll really break out because he's definitely something special. You wont be dissapointed picking this one up.$LABEL$1,0,-100
For dog lovers everywhere it's a tug at the heart.. My daughter read this book first and passed it on to me, knowing that I would love it. And I did. Lou Dean writes in such a way that I felt that I was seeing the world in a way that was new yet familiar. Any one who has ever loved a dog will relate to her tale of growing up with a best friend whose tail always wags when you enter the room. A friend who loves you for yourself and for no other reason. I cried and hugged my own two dogs during the last chapter. Cuddle up in your favorite chair with your best canine friend and lose yourself for an afternoon. This is a short, well-written coming of age story that I recommend unconditionally.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Awesome Shades. If you work outside, these are the shades for you. They are extremely light weight and comfortable to wear. The wrap-around shape provides good protection from flying debris.

Look elsewhere. This book was not good. It was conversationally written and thus easy to read, but if you are really paying attention and trying to learn something, you will notice inconsistencies and places where the chronology of events is not clear.For example: the Due Obedience Law is passed (exempting low-ranking soldiers from prosecution for dirty war crimes, as they were following orders). Next paragraph: "Despite government actions favorable to their interests, the officer corps remained unrepentant." Next paragraph - a group of soldiers protest. Next paragraph: "The Due Obedience Law followed." Huh?And that is just one example... one chapter was so jumbled I couldn't even follow it. If I could do it all over again, I'd choose one of the other histories of Argentina.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Wordy, too little finance. Someone recommended this as a taut financial thriller. Well at over 500 pages it's NOT taut! I realize people reading financial thrillers envy their protagonists (the "wannabe" effect), but the portrayal of the protagonist here is annoyingly silly and shallow: keeps gloating about his Ivy education, berating everyone else, travelling the world etc etc etc.As a result the FEW chunks of financial and political plot (the dynamics of distressed debt default in syndicated loans, elasticity of oil with other markets, the details of algorithmic trading by what is known today as VWAP, TWAP etc.) are watered down with too much annoying, long winded, completely inconsequential tripe pertaining to the "high culture" of the protagonist. You get the idea. Bleah. The tripe to plot ratio in this book is over 60%. This book could be a "good" 200 page read. Instead we are treated to the author's diarrhea.$LABEL$0,0,-100

The guy who gave this CD a 1-star rating was wrong. This CD sounds great, offering different versions of some of the songs we've come to know from previous albums. Townes remains alive and kickin', thanks to the loving production of Jeanene VZ. Thanks to her for her hard work and devotion, and to the sensitivity of the musicians she selected to work on the album. I think this version of "For The Sake of the Song" is the best yet. It made me really feel sad, all over again, that Townes has left us so soon.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Ash Wednesday. As an Elijah Wood fan, I stupidly spent the money to buy the DVD "Ash Wednesday" thinking that if Elijah was in it, it would be worth spending the bucks to see more hours of 'that face' on my television screen. Boy, was I wrong! What an awful movie! And frankly Elijah didn't do well in it because he didn't fit in! Surrounded by dirty, bitter, foul-mouthed losers, he could not quite find his niche. Further more, the storyline is ridiculous. At times it seemed that dialogue was being invented...which actually would be an easy undertaking by depositing a particular four-lettered verb between each and every syllable. If you like Elijah as I do, skip this movie. Buy the much more superior "All I Want".$LABEL$0,0,-100

This is a "Short Stories" review since there isn't one. After all that's been said above about this heroic album, "Olias," it would be silly to go on. Since I haven't found the first Jon & Vangelis album, "Short Stories," on Amazon, I thought I'd give it a go. At the time, knowing that Yes had disbanded yet again but in a way that signalled a true breakdown of the 70's musical vision, I was a desperate man. "Short Stories" should be made available by Amazon because it is the LAST Yes-vision album to be written. Vangelis rises to the occasion orchestrally and rythmically while Jon delivers the cleverest melodies. I only wrote this to tell you it's one of the last jems from the Yes-related folks at their best. That's all.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Fun book for kids. We liked this book and my 23 month old (well she was 19 or 20 months old when we go the book)liked the colors and the interactive parts in the book.

I'd like that shower now, please.... There's an amazing quote on the back cover of this book, something along the lines of, "Without obscenity, our cities are dreary places and life is bleak." And wholeheartedly agreeing - the Disneyfication of NYC 42nd Street to my mind rips the heart out of the city - I plunge in. What do I find? Nothing much that's terribly obscene, merely sorta sad and tawdry. The only thing that seperates it from a technically accomplished photodocumentation of a fratboy bachelor party is the mild millennial frisson the [gaijin] reader gets from the Tokyo floating-world setting. The Kenneth Starrs of the world (and there are lots, wouldn't you know) will find plenty to gasp at - "Look! She's got his penis in her mouth! Shocking!".

Great introduction to Queen, this tape changed my life.. After hearing Bohemian Rhapsody on the radio some time ago, I stormed into my parents cd collection and pulled out Classic Queen to listen to that marvelous Freddie Mercury hit. Soon I began to listen to the other tracks on the album and instantly fell in love with the band's unique sound. Right then I knew I had to see this band in action. When I popped in the tape right from its fabulous plastic wrapped box I sat for 80 minutes straight in awe. This provoked me to start a band, even though I only played the didgerido. Soon enough I had joined a real band, bought a cheap Johnson bass, and practiced incessantly. Now I sit back and jam with my band on my Fender fretless sunburst jazz bass pondering where I would be without that splendid video.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Hollywood Hogwash. The thrilling action sequences do not make up for the complete lack of historical accuracy, and anti-British tirade. Will American audiences swallow anything? The portrayal of a peace loving, patriotic, slave-freeing Hollywood hero is enough to make Ghandi vomit. Not that Mel Gibson is a bad actor, or the directing is poor, it's just that the message is absolute garbage.I'm a student from England, and am particularly interested in the British Empire and the colonies in the Americas. But this portrayal of valiant and innocent rebels standing up to evil, Nazi-like redcoats is laughable. British soldiers burning people alive in a church? On what grounds do they base that? The American rebels were early terrorists, not freedom fighters. Half of Americans liked British rule and King George, bless them!See the film if you must, it's quite enjoyable, but dig out your history books later and learn a few home truths about the American revolution. Long live the British!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Lots of fuss over very little. I really just don't get the fuss. So far this year this is the most mediocre book I've bothered finishing. And the only reason I finished is because a friend recommended it. I ended up skimming huge chunks just to get through it.The plotting was transparent. With perhaps two exceptions I could pretty much tell what was going to happen. Boring.The characterization was nonexistent. The heroine had no personality, the hero was perfect and had no personality, the secondary characters were archetypes. Boring.The world building was thrown at you in undigestible chunks at the beginning. A good author weaves the world seamlessly into the plot, IMO.And how hokey - she gets a normal face and doesn't know if she's ugly or pretty <eye roll>. And worst of all, this book ends in the middle of nowhere. It. Just. Ends.

If you can get it, do so because it has a beat and it is a cd that anyone will like. When I told my niece about this "new" discovery, she asked if I had been living under a rock.

GABO, AT HIS BEST, REJOICING IN MAGIC REALISM. A tropicalized Abelarde-et-Heloise-like story, in which a rabies epidemic is confused with diabolic possession. A beauty of Spanish + African ancestry, already incubating rabies, is pursued by a monk who was in his way to become a saint. Both the young woman and the monk fall for each other with a passion that challenges State and Church, the latter intent in destroying them through its instrument of terror, the Inquisition. They cannot win, of course, but they shake both structures. Her hair does not stop growing even after death. The estate of the decrepit Marquis and his love/hate relationship with his un-titled spouse of mixed origin are only surpassed by GABO himself in his Autumn of the Patriarch.$LABEL$1,0,-100

I was charged 51.00 US and was shipped the ONE piece (hand masker ONLY) and was NOT given my change back nor DID AMAZON do anything about it once I complained to them of these guys pulling the bait and switch.

If she's read half of those she's recommended in two volumes, RE-read many of them, AND found the time to write these books-listing-books atop that, well...I'm truly impressed.

Then again, there were a few which more than made up for them-and which I'd never have tried otherwise. I was delighted to find a few of my own favorites among her lists, and some that I'd found to be blatantly missing.The important thing is to keep reading once you find an author or a style you love.

Fine for killing time on a 5-hr flight, but mostly boring.... Grisham's "The Street Lawyer" won't keep you turning the pages with excitement like his earlier novels ("The Firm", "The Pelican Brief"). There's not a whole lot of suspense, fear, or emotion in this novel -- the main character has an epiphany that leads him to leave his high-paying, power law firm for a street clinic, helping out the homeless with their legal problems -- not the stuff of a thriller. To be sure, there's some contrived tension arising from some shady characters threatening physical violence and the hope that you're still reading The Firm. But the story mostly just unfolds and then gets resolved. At least the main character doesn't end up living in Aruba at the end of this story :-)For true Grisham fans (and I'm one of them), it's a quick and easy read that you might as well add to your collection, but it won't leave you talking about it the next day like many of his other novels...$LABEL$0,0,-100

the secret of her success. Gail Evans sets down the rules, both spoken and unspoken, that it takes to get ahead and be successful in business. Because they were created by men, following them as a woman presents a different set of challenges.Luckily, Evans lays out these rules in a practical, sympathetic manner. I guarantee that even if you're already a successful business-woman, you'll find at least a few things here that are helpful and surprising.Sexist-sounding or not, men do see the world differently than women, at least when it comes to business. Women, Evans argues, are socialized differently and because of this need to be aware of how men have set up the game, otherwise they will continue to be overlooked. That's why a book like this is such a help.$LABEL$1,0,-100

It didn't fade or degrade during that time either. It was one of the few options that didn't have dragons, or butterflies, or flames on it too. So if your looking for a nice plain cover to keep the wheel cool, this is the winner :)$LABEL$1,0,-100
Surprising disappointment. I gave up on King when he stopped writing horror a few years ago, but had to pick this one up. The Talisman was one of the best King (/Straub) books, so it seems that a sequel would be a sure hit. Unfortunately, this is not really a sequel to the Talisman. Its more of a horror/mystery story with some talisman references tacked on to the end. It was a good story, but the whole time I kept thinking how much better it could have been (Imagine Jack, Henry and Beezer on a journey through the territories).The first 500 pages could have been a lot shorter, leaving more room for what we really want - Jack in the territories again.I think the high point was the tie-in to the gunslinger series though, wonder how he talked Straub into that?$LABEL$0,0,-100

Disappointing. Having purchased nearly every ballpark book in existence, I have to say that this one falls short of the mark. The author, evidently a Dodger fan, (pages and pages on Dodger Stadium and Ebbets field) gives scant information on many of the parks with some really poor pictures, when pictures are provided at all. For example, the author never shows an interior picture of the new Miller Park. There are much better books dealing with ballparks - skip this one, its not worth the money.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Britney is terrible. This is more proof that Britney is a joke, she'll be out of a career in maybe...a year or two.

So very odd.... I bought this book because of the good review I read in 'Preview' and was really kind of confused when I actually sat down and read it. I have never read anything like it, the whole set up and style was foriegn to me. I found the story itself pretty depressing. At least the parts of it I understood. I can see how some people would consider it deep and moving, but when I finished it I just felt like I had been tricked out of fourteen bucks. Read the first few pages of the preview on this site, it gives you a pretty good idea of the tone of the book. Wish that I had done that.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Typical China Junk. Most of the good reviews are on older models. The new ones are made in China. Typical Chinese quality control.

The unit ran for hours and never heated up the small room 10x12 room it was in, even though the smaller sh-1507 could heat it up just fine. The digital controls also appeared to be flaky.

I REALLY REALLY WISH I COULD HATE THIS GAME. Being one of my most wanted items on the top of my Christmas wish list last year I was really happy when my Survivor game arrived courtesy of Santa himself and I couldn't wait to play it. The day after Christmas the trouble began as the game froze while trying to load an immunity challenge and I ended up starting the game again and the day after that the game froze AGAIN at the very same part and starting the game over again was very tiring for me. Finally tired of messing with the game i took Survivor out and popped in the Sims and I was really happy. Mark Burnett should be really ashamed of what Infogames has really done to the computer games of his creation. And people and diehard Survivor fans will be disappointed with this game.

HORRIBLE BOOK - WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I am a network engineer with almost 10 years experience. I have typically shied away from certification tests because I have always found them to be of the "right answer, wrong answer and TEST ANSWER" category. Security+ is absolutely no different but my job required that I take this certification. I signed up for a class at the local college and this was the textbook for that class.I read the book cover to cover twice, skimmed it twice more, answered the end-of-chapter questions, took the practice exam included on the cd over 20 times and passed everytime with scores 85% and higher. I failed the security+ exam. The difference between the questions on the test and the topics in this book was amazing. DO NOT RELY ON THIS HORRIBLE BOOK TO GET YOU THRU THE TEST.

Disappointing. After reading the claims that this book would turn the world on it's ear, I was expecting a whole bunch more. There's been more than 50 years of scientific research into fossil fuels, I find it difficult to believe that all of a sudden everything we know about oil is wrong. A few quoted technicians versus 1000's of teams of geologists and research specialists doesn't seem like a fair match.This book didn't prove it to me, oil is fairly obviously becoming harder and harder to drill for, and more expensive to bring up. The Canadian Shale takes almost as much energy in natural gas to produce the oil as it's worth, and they can only generate a million barrels a day. Hardly enough to make a difference in a world that uses 89 million barrels of oil per day.For another book in this category I highly recommend Michael Ruppert's "Crossing the Rubicon". THAT book makes sense, and scares me as a see the effects of our diminishing cheap oil supply.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Forward thinking. I believe we are all given a brief time to share the gospel with others. And in the process, we should always be looking for others to "take our place"...so to speak. The Leadership Baton gives a practical view on how to do just that. These are people (the authors) who have obviously "practiced what they preached" and are genuinely serving God, remembering we are all here for a brief time. And we all should be asking the Lord how we can help others become servant leaders. I recommend it to anyone in leadership roles in the church, be it as a profession or a layman.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Ho-Hum, the humor is kind of mean. I watched this once and wasn't too impressed. I did not see the original so didn't know the back stories, but I still felt like I knew what was going on. Nothing jumped out as being good, however, as a mom, I don't think I want my son watching this.Hood goes into training with a group of women known as "Sisters of the Hood." There's women there of all ages but there is one old lady who seems to be the comic relief. As in, a rolling pin hits her and that's supposed to be funny. I'm not sure why, but it's supposed to be. Then later on she falls (not sure why, maybe something else hits her) but then the head lady steps on her. Hard. In fact she walks all over her. It's like she did it purposely! Why is being mean to an old lady funny? Is there a back story in which this old lady did something that I am unaware of? I didn't like my son seeing this kind of behavior. Which actually worked out well because even though we saw it once, he never asked to see it again.$LABEL$0,0,-100

challenging theme, bad writing. For those who feel the dramatic difference between the 1950-1960 generation, and that of 1970-1980,and are troubled by it, this book is the answer.

Learning to Read with Reader Rabbit. I ordered this software for my almost 4 year old who loved the Reader Rabbit Toddler software, but had outgrown it. To get the most out of it, your child should have the ability to hold and click a mouse, and should already have basic recognition of capital and lower-case letters. The lowest level is perfect for my child but would have been too difficult at ages 3 - 3 1/2. The software teaches both letter and word recognition as well as phonics. The games are cute and when your child gets tired of learning to read there are fun songs and graphics to listen to with "reading propaganda" lyrics about how fun and important it is to learn to read.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Absolutely Atrocious. The self-aggrandizement is downright nauseating. Randal can easily put you to sleep with his "knowledge" and "insight".

His constant chastizing of the Bush administration as simpletons toward their policy on Terror is quite comical since his grand idea is appeasement/containment.

A quick reference to those forgotten legends. First thing you will notice is that this is definitely a picture book. I has pictures of great works of art that depict different interpretations of great legends (and I believe them all) from around the word and throughout time.This book is a keeper. As time passes and your interests move form one location to another this book will get you off the ground with the basics. I checked out Persephone as I have a copy of Dante Gabriele Rossetti's Persoperine in the library. I found references and related art peppered through the book.

Of Mice and Men. Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was set during the Great Depression in CA. In this book there are two characters called Lennie and George. They are the two migrant workers, who had travel together and they want to save some money and buy a ranch of their own. George is a small person, ¡quick and dark of face¡. He always takes care of Lennie and he act like a father to Lennie. Lennie is a huge man and has a mind of a child. He always gets into trouble. Every time when Lennie gets into trouble, George always gets him out of the trouble. Lennie acts like a son to George. Will George and Lennie make their dream come true or will Lennie¡s weak mind and strong body destroy their dream?The book Of Mice and Men is a good book. I will rate it as four stars.

Makes a good cup of coffee, BUT.... I was disappointed after spending $90.00 for this coffee machine. Cons: It is cheaply made, no insulation, very loud, and no water filter. Now the thing that makes me most crazy is the screw down cap on the carafe, it is extremely hard to open after you brew the coffee because the heat from the coffee distorts the cap,, making it next to impossible to unscrew to get your first cup of coffee. The cap has a thin edge with small bumps to grip, very bad design. It slowly gets easier as the coffee looses it heat. Pros: The water comes out at 200 degrees which is a good thing for making a great cup of coffee. The coffee stays hot for a long time like 5hrs. If you don't mind all the negatives than this is the coffee machine for you.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Tootsie does not suck :). I have to admit, I was never really a fan of 80's movies. Very few movies filmed in the 80's have ever appealed to me. So after watching Tootsie, I was glad that I had found one comedy made in the 80's that does not suck. In fact, it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, an unemployed actor who pretends to be a woman in order to get a job on a soap opera, and raise enough money to produce his roomate's new play. Bill Murray plays his roomate, and is very funny in this role, one of the funniest I've seen him in actually.

Terrific product. I wish I would have had this years ago!!! I've tried every method of hair removal available, this is far and away the best!Far less painful than waxing, more practical than shaving.Within an hour of first getting this I had done my legs, arms and face. It is very fast and works right into my regular routine.I noticed that it worked best on 1-2 day stubble after shaving.Tip: Use a loofah sponge to reduce ingrown hairs.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good but needs some more explanation. I have been reading this book for a couple of weeks and have found it very helpful in my journey towards understanding Java Development. There are lots of examples and the book is generally very readable.I do have a critiscism though. The book in some area's could have done with a little bit more detail in its description of some of the tasks provided by ANT. For example in it's covering of the <apply> task the use of the <mapper>, <srcfile/> and <targetfile/> tasks within the context of the <apply> task was only 2 sentences. Although the authors had covered <mapper> in a previous chapter they could have discussed them a little bit more in the context of thier use within the <apply> task. I had to sit down and work out how to use them rather than relying on a clear explanation by the book.All in all though I have found this book helpful and I now feel as if I understand ANT quite well.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Revelation in fiction - awesome. I read the entire series and loved it! It is a great introduction to the book of Revelation and what the End time may look like, on a personal level.

Miserable, boring book. I picked this book up with the hope of finding a strong, moving story of a child fighting death. And, for a while, it was pretty good. But the problem is it's basic plot: child fights death. For 100-something pages. The book basically begins with "Johnny is going to die. Lemme tell you all about it. Every day of it." And so on. The plot is alright, but there needed to be more added to it to keep things interesting. It tells you of his slow struggle with death by nearly each excruciating day. Most of the time, it's nothing interesting at all! It's like: Johnny went in for testing. Now I'm going to tell you all about his cancer, all over again. And the testing that happened, and what witty things he said to the nurse, and so on. It's awful. I skipped twenty pages, and I found I was able to pick up exactly where I had left off twenty pages ago. I had missed nothing. That's how much it drags. It's a miserable excuse for literature.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Eerily Refreshing!. I watched the movie on TV & am now going to add the DVD to my collection! You're constantly pulled into the plot but never quite know until the end, just exactly what's going on.

It keeps you constantly guessing who's good & who's evil!$LABEL$1,0,-100

USA Today the Complete 4 Sport Stadium Guide (2nd Ed). An useful book in 1998, getting bit useless in year 2000. A lot of that has to due to old stadiums long gone and new ones coming on line.

Not What I expected.... I ordered this for my husband. It is not good. This Tea has a funky smell and tastes the same.

Boy(band) was I disappointed.... I guess I got completely swept up in my new love affair with Robbie Williams. I really was excited to order this retrospective of music of the band that help shape and mold the funk/pop/sex-god/in-yer-face Robbie Williams into the master of Escapology. Nothing on this CD remotely reminds me of Robbie. All I can say is thank God he was able to escape with his talent! Not only is the music here sappy (and, believe me, I expected that to a degree) but the recording is weak. I have to turn the levels up on my system so high that when I play any other CD the volume scares the hell out of me. Weak songs, weak voices, weak harmonies and a weak recording make for an investment I regret. I do enjoy owning, if not listening to, the peppy remakes of "How Deep Is Your Love" and "Could It Be Magic" so I guess it's worth the two stars.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Tres Jolie. Beautiful as always. I love Daniels voice no matter what he's singing. He is an amazing artist with incredible versatility. I prefer this and Comedies Humaines(my fav cd in general) to some of his early work, which can sometimes feel a bit dated. You can tell they were done in the early 90's. It's funny, I don't speak french but for a couple words and I prefer his french albums to the English, they seem more poignant. This ablum is a bit lighter than comedies, more upbeat. For a good preview visit his page on myspace, and as always, I have to say: If you haven't listened to Notre Dame yet, forshame, and if you like his voice at all then you must listen to Le Petit Prince.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Classic document. You don't know about boogie, about Canned Heat and about this period if you don't know this album. The 40 minutes Refried Boogie is the ultimate jam session I know of.

A husbands Journey to save his marriage. I was so pleased with this novel. I was very anxious to read it, after I had read the Notebook. I absolutely adored the character Wilson. He was so determined to convey his ardent love for his wife in the most exquisite way I have ever read on paper. The story revolves around Jane and Wilson's daughter, who Jane thinks is rushing into a marriage with a boy that she has been living with. Throughout the novel Wilson endeavors to become a better husband by cooking elaborate dinners and attempting to lose weight. The novel also includes Janes affable father, Noah, who aches the loss of late wife, Allie.This novel will not dissapoint Spark fans...it delivers a strong message that marriage is sacred and should never be taken for granted.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Clone Wars makes up for what was lacking in the prequel trilogy.. Season One of the Clone Wars is simply put, outstanding.Voice work is great, CGI is beautiful to look at, and the music (even though it's quite a departure from William's standards) is also perfectly done.Even though the epsiodes are each less than a half hour, they all have a huge scope and nice character development.While it is animated and broken down into the short episode format, the Clone Wars has greater story strength and is even more "adult" than the prequel triology ever was.For Star Wars fans new and old, and even those left with a bitter taste from the prequel era films, you owe it to yourself to check out Season One of the Clone Wars.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Decent ear-buds, especially for it's price range. These have decent sound quality - while it doesn't sound like a 200$ or even a 50$ earbud; it's still a significant improvement over stock earbuds.Especially with bass - I didn't expect bass like this from a 20$ earbud, let alone a 10$ earbud.The design is simple and rugged: the case even resisted my purposeful attempts to crack it.Now as for the downsides: The case's cover pops off easily after a while, and the cord is really, really short - I sometimes have to tilt my head when it's plugged into my computer.Secondly, the sound is very sensitive to positioning if you don't have the cover - it gets muted if I tilt my head in the wrong direction, and it feels awkward. And it's still an open-ear earbud, so don't count on this when you're mowing the lawn or something else noisy.Still a good choice if you aren't willing to pony up an additional 10$ for better earbuds.$LABEL$1,0,-100

1 Star is 1 Star too many.. Even though this arrived in perfectly undamaged packaging, the table top had an ENORMOUS gouge across it that looked like someone'd lost control of their Dremel grinder. And since the packaging was fine (even that thin, gauzy plastic covering the piece) that means it left the factory in that condition. I thought I'd assemble it anyway. Just for kicks. The screws aren't quite long enough to use the washers and still be able to catch the wood. The cabinets doors aren't wide enough to cover the cabinet opening - there's about a half ince gap there - and one door is warped or something so it doesn't stay closed anyway. This worthless contraption could never have sold for the $350+ stated original price. Save yourself the trouble.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Best CD of the Year. This is by FAR the best CD I have purchased in the past year. No Mermaid was the first song I heard on the CD when it was first released, and I instantly fell in love with Sinead's mellow, wistful music. And the CD is very complete. There are some catchy, faster moving tracks like No Mermaid, Whatever it Takes..., and Diving to Be Deeper. Then there are slower, more penetrative tracks like Don't I Know, Hot on Your Trail, and Loose Ends. The song What Can Never Be actually made me cry.

It's not a story about a Lost Eden. It is about a Restoration Plan. I thought it was really something about Africa's Lost Eden, like they were able to capture on film the last "Eden" Animals in Africa, without humans. I don't want to see humans in "Africa" or "Eden"-themed films. I waited for about an hour for the real story to begin but as soon as the bull elephant died, the story was over even before I knew it. What a total waste of money! And there's only one story in it. Oh wait, I couldn't have waited for an hour because it was just 50 minutes.

Only for a long flight to San Jose, CA. Somewhat interesting, but I should have known that there was trouble brewing when I spotted a typographical error in the second paragraph of the dust jacket of the book. The main character's name was mis-spelled. The book reads like a dream...disjointed, rambling, and out of focus...probably best forgotten the next day. Good for a flight across country, but only if you have already read the day-old Tribune that you found at the airport.

They both constantly hang up and I have to power them off and then on. HP support said I needed more memory, but my previous HPs with less memory never had 10% of the problems that these do.

Another Rip-off. No matter how many Punisher movies they make or comices they sell, two things do not change.1. The Punisher continues to be a clear rip-off/imitation of the Executioner, Mack Bolan, series. All the way from the character's background and motivation to the uniform and weapons he uses to even a war van which was another Executioner series original. Except the Executioner has a sense of right and wrong, emulates the true meaning of justice, yet does it with heart.2. For approximately every 5-30 "bad guys" the Punisher kills, he ends the life of one innocent person.If you believe the end justifies the means and do not mind a few innocent people getting in the way, then you're the type to enjoy this immitation of the largest selling book series in history.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Such a warm, sexy sweet scent.. Rich, sweet scent that smells like caramel and warm vanilla. This is not one of those cheap teen perfumes that fades away quickly.

Last Junior Year. I read this book for the first time when still in grade school. I loved this book because I could relate with the horse subject that it contains. So many times the "horsey" books are written by authors who are not really familliar with how life really is in this strange horse show world that some of us live in. This book, although was in places very fictional, also had many realistic aspects to is as well as many true to life locations of horse shows as well as people.

Disappointing. As other reviewers have noted, this is a very disappointing version of Sudoku. In addition to their complaints, I would state that I get the same board offered multiple times (both Sudoku and Kakuro). I don't know if this is because I haven't met some minimum time? Speed is inhibited by the navigation of the game (at least it does let you wrap around from the top of the screen to the bottom, etc.).One thing I do like about the game is that, being new to Kakuro and not very quick with math, the game tells you when your math does not add up. When I get more proficient with Kakuro, this may become a "leave me alone, darnit" feature, as it is currently on the Sudoku side of the game.Brain Age's version is soooo much better - can't those folks just put out an independent Sudoku?$LABEL$0,0,-100

Low water mark. There weren't many occasions when America's greatest film actor, James Stewart, was flat-out terrible in a movie but this is one of them. For reasons no film historian has been able to explain, Stewart's remarkable skills as an actor deserted him in the early Sixties, and he was never the same. It's an atrocious performance in a Civil War film that is full of them. Only James Best as a Rebel veteran manages to bring some life to the proceedings. The script is sickeningly sanctimonious and made all the worse by the incompetent direction of one of Hollywood's all-time hacks, Andrew V. McLaglen, who also blighted the later years in John Wayne's career.$LABEL$0,0,-100

No longer a good product due to cheapening of design. This used to be a great baster - the best. I am sorry to say that the manufacurer decided to make the walls of the bulb out of thinner silicon than they did just a short time ago. This change has made it nearly useless as a baster as it now lacks "sucking-power". It is truly unfortunate that an excellent product has been rendered useless by a short-sighted decision to save some money. Shame on the pin-head(s) responsible.... shame.

2 failures in less than a year. We bought this unit to use in our daughters room. We use it specifically for the CD player to "sing" her to sleep at night. The first one we had died after about 4 months of use. Putting any CD in it resulted in it saying no disc. Philips replaced it at the cost of shipping which wasn't too bad, but now our second one has met with the same fate after another 4 months.I have no idea what the cause is other than poor quality components. My wife has a philips CD clock radio (earlier model) that is more than 6 years old. She uses it every night before bed and it is humming along just fine.I wouldn't recommend this model.

A waste of money. I bought the WinTV tuner to use primarily as a video capture card. Frankly, I believe using a computer as a TV monitor is a waste of a good computer. I intended to use the WinTv-PVR 350 to convert video tapes into digital format but when attempting conversions the computer freezes up. I have lots of RAM and plenty of room on my hard drive. The longest capture I have managed so far is 15 minutes, but most range in size from one minute to six minutes. After spending a day splicing together the fragments of a VHS tape I converted with the 350 and which I then burned to DVD, I discovered the quality of the image far below DVD quality. It is far below video tape quality.I am willing to spend some real money on a good video capture card but it isn't the WinTV 350. It's not useful as a capture card and it's too small to be a doorstop.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Interesting Title but Little More. Coming on the heels of "Icebreaker" this ranks as a major disappointment from John Gardner. The plot and prose is a collection of disjointed and very uninspiring ideas for our hero James Bond. However, several of these ideas did seem to make it to the screen shortly after in some of Roger Moore's later Bond films and Timothy Dalton's first outing. "Role of Honor" ultimately has a rambling plot that leaves the reader totally disinterested. I was very disappointed with this novel.$LABEL$0,0,-100
History forgot this one because IT SUCKS.. If you look at the majority of the reviews on the other DVD page, they all complain about this being too campy and too cheesy. Well let those reviews warn you- Bond and space do not match.I'm not going to mention the plot here since it's just plain ridiculous. But this is indeed the third worst Bond movie ever. When Cubby came up with the idea for this abortion, he said something like "It's not science fiction, it's science fact." Well if we're supposed to believe that Space in real life is Star Warsish, than this is indeed "Science fact"- a Turd of one, that is.It's just a complete and utter disaster. A completely inane and stupid plot, a bored looking and sweaty Moore, a cheesy-as-all-hell final fight, this all equals an incredibly cheap and cheesy Bond that's disgusting and just plain awful. And what was with the "Bondola"?In short, just avoid this one. Time abandoned this movie because IT SUCKS.$LABEL$0,0,-100

fast moving story. Nora Roberts has proved that she can tell a story. The details make you feel for the characters. You will find yourself rooting for some of the characters to pull through. You will find you will relate to these characters as though you have know them, or maybe wish you had. (I did enjoy the ghost visits, as I feel our love ones are near, whether we choose to notice or not.) The only objection I have is I do not feel it necessary to go into details with steamy love scenes! It is not that I am a prude, but I don't find this to be necessary to tell a good story.

Still, if you like your guitars thick and loud, you may dig this one too. Coincidentally, there is a band named Magnified who have had their name before Failure used it.

"Operation Rogosh" on video--finally!. The great "Operation Rogosh" episode of "Mission: Impossible" featured the series' first time-displacement scam, with an environment completely recreated from scratch and a mission that, to be successful, had to be completed within a strict time-frame. To one extent or another, this first-year installment set the tone for the rest of the series, and after 37 years, "Rogosh" is still fresh, and still a model of staging and editing.Director Leonard Horn was a veteran of the sci-fi classic "The Outer Limits" ("The Man Who Was Never Born," etc.), as was writer Jerome Ross ("The Man with the Power"). Other "Limits" tie-ins include directors Lee H. Katzin and Paul Stanley, as well as co-producer Alan Balter.The second episode on the video, "The Train," is more gimmick-reliant but quite entertaining, with one especially nerve-wracking moment.

This is a superbly theatrical tale that examines the nature and purpose of storytelling. Why do we humans feel it necessary to invent fictious worlds and examine our life not through direct observation of the real but of the invented? And in a land where personal freedoms are virtually nonexistant, how long can the storyteller survive, before he is done away with by the forces of control and order?

It was mentioned in reviews of Charlaine Harris's books (which I love) and I wrongly assumed (you know what they say about assuming...) that the Anita Blake books would be similar. Hamilton introduced an interesting universe but it went down hill from there. I didn't particularly like the heroine and the book was just so inconsistent. A group of vampires hire Blake to do a job for them and instead of actually letting her do the job, they keep trying to kill her. Doesn't quite make sense huh?

I asked my mom to get me Voice of an Angel (so I could pay her back, of course), but she purchased Charlotte Church instead. I fell in love with it. My friends may think that I am crazy and listen to 'wierd' music, being I am only 15. I laugh at that. I hate pop music! They are the ones who don't listen to good music. I at least gave their kind of music a chance. This CD is perfect. So it is played switching places with my Edwin McCain and Motzart CDs. What a combonation of music!

Find a proper history instead. Perhaps it's a case of, "It's the sort of thing you'll like, if you like that sort of thing", but I can't say that I liked this one. The author presents a very-nearly-interesting concept, that Custer survived the Little Bighorn fight, only to be court-martialed for his failures. However, he presents it in third-person, present tense; an unusual choice in modern literature. Also, the narrator offers the inner thoughts of a different character each chapter. The result is a style that I found tedious and forced. As to plot elements outside the realm of what one might read in a history, they appear to have been left out. Although one of the characters refers to the case as "having more intrigues than the Arabian navy", I suspect that I've known houseplants with more interesting lives. Finally, lacking any notes from the author, I'm left not knowing what was fiction and what was not. In the end, I wish that I'd read a proper history of the incident instead.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Works fine. Doesn't need additional tamper.. The machine works fine. I just wanted to comment that the included tamper also works fine and the comments I'd read about needing a "good" steel tamper are unwarranted. The plastic tamper mounted on the side of the machine is hard and sturdy and more than sufficiently rigid to tamp coffee plus its the right size. Comment about "needing" a steel tamper are just pretentious dribble. If you like the looks of separate steel tamper that's fine, but it won't improve the flavor of the coffee.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good for the job.. I bought recently this product and I have to say that it is working fine. I tried it with pork, beef, bread, onion and pepper and it is doing fine. It is heavy solid made product from stainless steel. However the knife and the grinder itself are catching rust, so probably they are not a stainless steel parts. For this reason I dry these parts after I wash the machine. As the product is cutting well everything I put inside I guess I shouldn't complain. I didn't try it for sausages yet, so I can't comment if it is doing a good job there. In genereal I consider the product as a good buy.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Con Job. This is another example of a low-quality item passed off using a high-quality brand name as cover.

Tedious, poorly organized, etc.. This book contains excerpts from several of Hubbard's other books, and in a couple cases from lectures. For a book the Church of Scientology pushes heavily, it's pretty awful. Almost all the 'sections' are preachy, most of the insights are unoriginal, and there are a few things which are patently offensive. For example, in one passage, "The Vocabularies of Science", Hubbard calls Japanese a "baby talk language" and proceeds to espouse his almost complete ignorance of the language. I find it difficult to believe the CofS includes that in their translations for prospective Japanese scientologists. On the other hand, if you think Japanese is a baby talk language, and also believe some of the other bizarre assertions in this book, maybe scientology is for you... In sum, I cannot fathom why any thinking person would join the CofS as a result of reading this book. Lousy, preachy, ignorant, and boring. To put it bluntly, a complete waste of money.$LABEL$0,0,-100

almost perfect. This is the third gravy separator I've owned. The first two were made out of plastic and I doubt that I got to use them more than 10 times before they cracked. I gave up on replacing them, since they were made out of plastic that could not stand the thermal shock, until I found this one. This one is made out of laboratory glass and has survived over a year of frequent use in my kitchen.The only gripe I have is that the spout is not profiled very well, and it's more or less impossible to pour out of it without spilling some of the liquid.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Don't waste your money. I bought one of these to replace my old WearEver Popcorn Pumper (RIP). Boy what I would give to resurrect the old pumper!! The first problem is that this popper is built with the airflow straight up so it blows unpopped kernels out into the bowl. The second problem is that it has such low airflow (necessary due to the direction) that it doesn't get the popped kernels out into the bowl so they build up and scorch. Add to that the fact that, again due to the airflow direction, it pushes a large number of unpopped kernels out with the popped corn. Then add that the butter melting container is also the corn measuring cup, so you need to stop and wash it between every batch. The butter melting cup is plastic, instead of aluminum like the WearEver, so it doesn't have good heat conduction and won't melt butter that isn't already half melted.Overall, don't waste your money.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Opened my Eyes to Facebook,and great story and actors ... I went to go see this movie in theatres with avg expectations at best, but let me tell you this movie delivered and then some. I had no clue the actualy story of how Facebook got started and was unaware that the guy who started Napster was even remotely involved. I am not sure how accurate this movie is to the true story but none the less, it was a well written story, and this movie wss CASTED perfectly having Jesse Eisenberg (who I feel doesnt get the acting credit he deserves, being compared to Michael Cera WAY @ MUCH), and Justin Timberlake did a incredible job portraying the guy who started Napster.I have a Blockbuster online membership,but this is the kind of movie you want to own imo, and they have a great deal for their 2 disc special edition DVD,but since I have a Blu Ray im getting it on Blu Ray which I hope includes the same material.Check out this movie.$LABEL$1,0,-100

works until it melts and the cooking plates fall off. Got this thing about a year ago, and the removable plates, timer, and adjustable temp are big improvements over earlier versions.

Today it fell off clanged onto the floor just missing my foot, spattering grease all over the place.Hamilton Beach and Cuisinart make similar products, and they are probably better engineered.

Great premise, but disappointing overall. Four very different individuals accidentally meet on the roof where they had all planned to commit suicide.The writing was abysmal and the characters were all very flat and unlikable.

Surpasses even the sparkling brilliance of "Black Woman"..

eh. ... ..not awful by any means and there are very pretty moments, but the overall album just lacks in emotion and depth compared to the original. many times the arrangements are very thin and have to leave out important harmonies and sometimes entire lines. it's still enjoyable, mind you. there's just no thom yorke. the absence of his voice really leaves you wondering what to think. if the makers of this cd read these things, can i offer a suggestion that you get a whole string choir with lots of members to beef up some sections and bring back a few things that had to be left out because of your numbers if you ever want to do more radiohead. and get the real man for the melodies.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Read this to be paranoid throughout your pregnancy. Although this book is written from the standpoint of presenting the facts, it does so in a warped and paranoid way. The "facts" presented in this book are not the facts but the author's extreme ideas presented from extreme reported examples that are perfect to make any mother-to-be paranoid about her pregnancy. This book will make you believe that having sex WILL cause you to have a miscarriage (which is extremely rare!) In addition, the author speculates that having one x-ray at any time in your life will cause all of your future offspring to be deformed... which could not be more FALSE. This book sells lies instead of the helpful information a mother-to-be will need.

Biased Ivy League reviews. This is a decent guide for the most part. The trouble is that the authors' biases are clear when they review Yale's "rival" schools.

The best children's book ever. I just read the other reviews of this book and feel compelled to add that it had a similarly profound effect on my life. It is only published every 20 years--1947, 1967, 1987 and hopefully again in 2007. It is the best children's book ever--an unrivalled compilation of timeless--and non-commercial--poems and rhymes.

Product Great but Seller is Shady. The phone that I purchase is great. It met all of the expectations of the razor phone. BUT, the product description was misleading. It said that it was "Unlocked for use with your existing GSM 850 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, GSM 900 MHz or GSM 1900 MHz service provider" To the untrained purchaser(me) I "assumed" (you know what happens when you assume!) that it was good for ANY service provider. My son tried to use it with his Verizon account and was unable to get it hooked up. At the very least, I think that the seller should have had a link (Like the one he sent me when I tried to return it!) to explain which providers it was good for. The seller was very shady in his presentation of the product. But if you have one of the GSM providers the phone is wonderful!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Funny, Fast paced. Dacinda(Daisy) Ann Minor, a character who can only exist in a little southern town, is the archetypal small town spinster librarian. But this particular old fashioned, next thing to a virgin, wants to get married and have babies. On her thirty fourth birthday, she decides to do something about it, and that's where the fun starts. She gets a makeover, moves out of her mother's house, witnesses a murder (unintentionally), buys a puppy, and starts something up with the town's hunky sheriff, who is far from a "good" ole boy. Now the romance in this book is more of the slam-bam-thanks and lets get married-ma'am variety than a Grand Romance, and the action is very secondary. What drives this story forward is Daisy, and then eventually Jack, and how Daisy's evolution changes them both. This is a very fast paced book- everything takes place in less than a month, but it's definitely worth reading if you enjoy a character-driven plot and laughing.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Bad design - it will crack at no time. I bought two of them. While installing them into my license plate frame, the thing did not fit over license plate. You actually have to cut your license plate edges about 1/8" at the sides to fit it into the cover.It didn't help and the cover cracked at one place near the license plate screw. Honestly, I didn't over tight the screw.I put it over my front license plate (I live in Illinois) only to protect myself against Laser radar. I think everybody who installed this cover over the license plate take a chance to be ticketed for obstruction the plate as it can be seen clearly only when you look at it absolutely straight. If you have a cop looking at your plate at the slight angle, at least couple digits would be distorted or hidden from being seen them at all. Plus I am not sure that Laser beam will be reflected from the license plate solely and not from the rest of the car.I would NOT buy this cover - waste of money!Michael.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Hmmm.... Now THIS is weird. REALLY weird. In fact, I'd go so far and call it the "The Velvet Underground and Nico" of our generation. Okay. Tricky, onetime Massive Attack rapper, teams up with gravelly-voiced singer Martine, and makes one of the weirdest albums you'll ever hear. I'm sitting here staring at the keyboard trying to explain what it sounds like and I'm unsuccessful. Some call it "trip-hop" but I say this sounds NOTHING like "Dummy" or "Mezzanine"! Ever heard the song "Downs" from Big Star's "Third Sister Lovers"? That's what a lot of this album sounds like. Unique percussion and static melodies. And lyrics along the lines of "I drink till I'm drunk and I smoke till I'm senseless" and "I f--- you in the a--." with song titles like "Ponderosa" and "Suffocated Love". Pot hallucination experiences put on record, I guess. It's all very VERY surreal.It's also very VERY unlistenable. But hey, so was "The Velvet Underground And Nico"!$LABEL$0,0,-100

good to a see an old friend. It's good to see Lolita Files back in the writng game. I have missed her books and her stories. This book gives great in- sight to where the characters have been and where they are headed next. This book screams for a sequel!! I like that she managed to bring readers up to date while showing a glimpse of the past throughout the book. I read this book in two days it was sooo good. I ony gave it four stars because the ending does leave you hanging for answers. Otherwise, great read!!$LABEL$1,0,-100
More Christmas Magic. Hats off to John Corbett, Stacy Edwards, Michael O'Keefe, Jack Palance and the Producers of Prancer returns. We've enjoyed Prancer for so many years and were so excited to see "Prancer Returns" come out. Again, the movie has taken "every day" people, has placed them in "every day" life situations and has created a masterpiece filled with Christmas magic. A wonderful movie for everyone in the family. A must see!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Delighted to see how many love this book.................. I love THE MIRROR and believe it is the best book ever published with my home town Boulder, Colorado as its setting. Those who are not big time travel fans (I confess I am not usually) can enjoy the book for its page turning plot and the historical detail Millhiser uses to make Boulder in the year 1900 come to life. I was under the impression this was a fairly obscure book but what a pleasant surprise to see it is still in print and loved by many. Great reading choice for Boulder lovers whether residents or visitors.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great book. I bought this book for a contemporary philosophy course at college, and found it very fascinating. Wilson uses science to explain a wide variety of human phenomenon. I read this book not only for class, but I found it so interesting that I read it for fun!It can be hard to get through if you don't have a strong science background.

Brushes okay, but.... This toothbrush does an okay job with teeth and gum brushing but it is DIRTY! I take the top off after my twice a day use and rinse it out in hot water. I replace the two parts in their proper places each time. Weekly, I separate the parts of the brush head to clean it and inside is the slimiest black stuff...stuff I have seen inside a sink drain. I had to use another toothbrush and a q-tip to clean it. I would never recommend this brush nor would I buy it again.

Bad Seiko Watch. Purchased this watch 12/7/2009 and gave it to my wife for Christmas present and on 2/1/2010 it died..........I took the watch to a mall and had a new battery installed just in case but it still will not work so I'll send it back to Seiko and hopefully it will be repaired..........this was an exact replacement of a watch I gave my wife 25 years ago that worked like a charm up until a couple of months before Christmas so I'm hoping I purchased a legitmate Seiko and not a cheap knockoff!!! I'm sending back to Seiko and will update this if it's repaired timely with no problems!They repaired the watch no problems and it's still working great.........as of 11/11/11$LABEL$0,0,-100

This toy is a keeper!. My son is 3 years old and is beg. to like thomas the train- I purchased this toy as a starter to see if he would take the time to play with a train set. It is very cute - however, it is on the noisy side. The legs do come off very easy and cannot be glued (they come undone) He plays with it all the time and I would recommend it to others.

So far this is AMAZING!!!!!. I got the for my son after reading Dr. Bock's book on the 4-A disorders. My son is a sickly child and the winter is usually a horrible time for the entire family. He has had croup more times than I can count and basically gets it every time he gets a cold. He has asthma and many food intolerance's on top of a weak immune system. Every winter of his life he has gotten the croup at least once a month if not more. Since taking the transfer factor he has not been sick even once!! It has been two months since his last episode. I hope I am not jumping the gun, but this is a first for us! I am very pleased with this product and it is the best supplement we have tried (and we have spent tons on supplements and food already).

Lasted less than 6 months. We've had a very bad experience with this blender. After not even six months of mild use, the body and the bottom part do not lock together anymore so we had to throw it out as there is no way to open it and try to fix it. Our feeling is that it has been designed with short life expectancy. Buy, use, and... buy again. We'll wait and buy a good brand whilst travelling abroad.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Expected better quality. I bought this item after a bit of research over the net. I have an HP computer, and since the bag is also from HP , I expected it to be well designed for HP computers and of course durable. It is well designed but it bit too heavier than I thought it would be. On the durability side, I am surprised to find that handles are coming lose. The threads are unraveling and as of now, the bag is not usable, because handles might break off. This has happened only after a normal usage and normal loads. The load included only a laptop, few documents, power adapter and a book of about half a pound!!Quite disappointed with the quality of this product. But there are chances that this might be defective piece. I am going to send it back to Amazon/HP and see what happens.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Hamlet. Though dozens of versions of Shakespeare's best-known play have been filmed, none rival this moody 1948 adaptation by master dramatist Olivier, who produced, directed, and acted. Streamlining the text to achieve a leaner, tighter feel, Olivier wrings tremendous feeling out of his indecisive, ever-brooding Hamlet, while the radiant Jean Simmons makes an exceptional Ophelia, the dour prince's doomed lover. Distinguished by its inventive camerawork and lush black-and-white photography, Olivier's "Hamlet" won four Oscars, including Best Actor (Olivier) and Picture.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A Very Superficial Book. I returned this book after reading half of it and skimming the other half. I can't find a single original observation to point to, and many of the observations about "Chinese etiquette" are really just observations about etiquette in general - such as the universal practice of starting a conversation with small talk.One particularly annoying part of this book is the author's practice of compling long lists of Chinese vocabularly, phrases, place names, and historical references, and then failing to provide the character or "tone" marks. As anyone with an even cursory knowledge of China knows, Chinese is a tonal language and, hence, without tone marks a vocabulary item is completely useless to a foreigner. Moreover, the author misspells many of the pinyin transliterations, and often provides phonetic transliterations that are non-standard or inacurrate.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Poor product. I purchased one of these computers only six weeks ago. On the second time out I detected black spots on the screen, where there should have been pixels. Pressing the screen brought some of them back, but as the day progressed the marks became cracks in the LCD screen itself. I reported the matter to HP the next day and they agreed to collect the unit for warranty repair. Some 10 days later they called me up demanding $650 to replace the screen, saying they were not prepared to honor the warranty for a crack.The lid is totally too flimsy to take the stress of holding the closed unit and lifting it from a carry bag. There is a connector right where you grasp the case, and this can dig in and crack the screen. For a portable laptop the design is not fit for purpose.NB the electronics work great but without a screen are of little value!$LABEL$0,0,-100

worked flawlessly for me. Just finished doing my taxes with it. It imported my last year's data with no problems, and continued to work without a hitch. (MacOS 9.2.2, lots of memory). (haven't tried the state version, or printing to an HP printer.) If I had a nit to pick, it would be that the point in Taxcut's interview where you enter your state tax refund begins by saying "Did you or your spousereceive a form 1099-G for2001?" It eventually goes on to mention that this is the place to enter your state tax refund even if you didn't get a 1099-G, but I missed that the first time through.On my wishlist for Taxcut would be the ability to "print" a PDF of the finished tax return. This is not so pressing, however, as there are various commercial/shareware/freeware ways of getting this functionality, and MacOS X has it built in.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Double burner reversible grill/griddle. I decided on this product after reviewing many both in stores and online.I chose this griddle as it is made in the U.S., is the "just right" size we were looking for, and is reversible which is a bonus.I also like the fact that is an easy to clean surface but is also durable and sturdy. That is very important to us as it will be used on our outdoor grill most of the time. We also have other family members that will use it and it will get some rougher use that way.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great if you're really into food shavings. I had the same experience as many of the reviewers here. This "slicer" is totally useless. If you put ANY kind of pressure down on the item to be sliced it will not cut through; otherwise you just get shavings.

Not a big fan. I liked the YES products, their first two albums were really good. This product was mixed very badly, and the songs are very weak. But I'm a big E.L.P. fan, but I'm also a recording engineer too. This product should have been thought out alittle bit better. That's just my opinion. I was never a big Rick Wakeman fan, and I've listened to some of his other works. I can't really recommend this product to others, it just doesn't cut the mustard.I've worked with other musicians who just throw some crap together and kick it out the door. Sorry guys, you should have taken some time to put together a better production.

Highly Effective Tool!. I just finished reading The 25 Habits of Highly Successful Salespeople by Stephan Schiffman, and I found it not only to be a helpful and informative book, but also highly entertaining. I was afraid that this would be a dry, technical book that I would have to "choke down" in order to get the information that I needed, kind of like a kid eating spinach for the vitamins! But boy, was I wrong! I really enjoyed Mr. Schiffman's style, and I learned a lot from the information he included; a lot of it is common sense if you think about it, but he triggered the thought process. This is a handy and enjoyable reference book that I plan to keep handy, and have with me on so I can refer to it as I make my sales visits. I especially liked his summary of the 25 habits at the end -- a great "quick reference" to give you a last minute "pep talk"!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Sadly disappointed in this product. After reading the reviews, I was syked to receive my order of Ibarra chocolate. I love hot chocolate, and look forward to trying new flavors and brands. I've never had "Mexican Chocolate", so maybe this is what it is supposed to be like, but I didn't like it at all. It was hard as a rock, tasteless, and messy. I followed the instructions of boiling some milk, chopping the chocolate in my blender, and mixing it together. It came out foamy, like one reviewer described, but I was surprised to find it tasteless and flat!! I ended up adding 4 T. of my standard coco mix just so I could finish the drink. This was not at all what I expected, so if any of those three reviewers are looking for an open package, you can purchase mine! In one word: YUCK!!!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not for children. The cover of this game is dangerously close to the innocent family game. We bought it at a "breakfast with santa" event, never considering there was a adult-only version. Pretty surprising for the grown ups and eye-opening for the kids! The only hint on the box (after we looked closer) was it said it was for "4 or more adults".

Opeth - the other side. Purchased this based on the bands association with Steve Wilson of the band Porcupine Tree. I heard the instrumental passages and the mellow vocals of Mikael in some of the longer Opeth songs. It was the death metal "singing" style that turned me off. BUT all of the other stuff was great. This Damnation album is a tad too mellow for their core fans but it's a great standalone listen for anyone who loves good music. I wish the band would abandon the cookie monster vocals and just go straight forward singing - his voice is so great to begin with. Anyway - LOVE THIS ALBUM ! BUT IT !!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Interesting Book with Depth and Style. Ivy Cole and the Moon by Gina Farago is not the usual type of book I would pick up on my own. On the surface it seems to be of the horror genre, not one of my favorites. But this 'werewolf' book is far more than it seems on the surface. I was immediately struck by the beauty of the structure as the writer weaved her tale with flashbacks and revelations about the characters. The setting, familar to me as my own backyard, only added to my interest in the story and the names of the characters were right for the area and for the story. The fascinating theme of the story lifts the book far beyond genre fiction.If you're looking for an interesting read with some chills but also with some depth and style, think about Ivy Cole and the Moon.$LABEL$1,0,-100
just my opinion.... At first glance I thought McTeague was going to be a relatively boring read. However, as I progressed through the novel I found myself enjoying it and I discarded my initial thoughts about the book.McTeague is actually a brilliant, little, fiction story about the innate savagery of mankind. In the novel, McTeague is large, and seemingly harmless, man. McTeague's docile qualities are slowly shed throughout the novel and his underlying, predominant atavistic qualities and behaviors take hold.One of the great things about this fiction novel is that it was derived from a non-fiction event. In the back of the novel there is an in-depth depiction of the events in which the ideas from McTeague were taken from. For those who seek to delve deeper into the novel, there is also a section of criticisms and lots of other useful and interesting discussions in the back of the book.All in all, I enjoyed reading this novel and I would recommend it to anyone.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Poor Photography Ruins Book. Very disappointing book. Comes across more as a gimmick to make some fast cash by self publishing a book that includes the authors photos combined with Christian "inspirational wisdom" scattered across the pages from Lewis, Mullins and others.The best thing this book has going for it is the cover design. It's downhill after that. The photography is poor at best. Several images are blurry, while many suffer from poor exposure, lifeless composition, and a printing that renders the photographs dull.If you are looking for a gift book or coffee table photo book with eye popping photographs with "inspirational wisdom", this book does not deliver. Do not buy this book based upon it's cover.Highly disappointed. Not recommended.$LABEL$0,0,-100

for all fans great and small. very good series, it is great to have the whole set including the two specials they made. the first 4 seasons are the best the last three have a different actress playing the role as Helen which doesn't quite work for me and there are a lot of episodes without Tristin in them and you really notice his absence. they try to make up for this by adding the character Callum but he does not fill the void, really only makes me wish to have the original Helen and Tristin back. but all in all very charming series.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Careful. I couldn't believe dark craz's comments on track 4, hot bars, and track 9, All I can do. I'm writing this review simply to defends S&M, and two of the best (among others) songs on this EP. To say that hot bars doesn't flow it ludicrous at best. Bump this track in the summer time with your windows down and life won't get much better. Both of their flows are unparalleled. Granted, there isn't a deep message here; it is such a feel good song though. This track reminds me that everything is all good. Not to mention, when grouch is on the beat, there is rarely--if ever a disappointment. But that is just opinion I suppose. Maybe. Track nine, all I can do, is another S&M classic, with a solid message flowed eloquently over another dope Grouch beat. S&M, especially Murs can flow to fit any mood, they can always make you reflect, and feel good about most any situation. Basically, please be careful when writing CD reviews, there are reputations on the line.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Handsome Blender, But..... Purchased this blender because it was sold as a display at 40% off. Knew nothing about it, but did some research online after purchasing. Seemed to work fine for me at first, but this morning, only it's second use, I noticed it was leaking just as many reviewers had complained. Also, the "smoothie" function produced more of a "chunky" than a "smoothie" which was very disappointing. Other reviewers have noted that the blade assembly tends to freeze up, and emits dark residue over time, as well as the motor failing after only 1 or 2 years. With only a 1 year warranty I don't feel too confident about this product. If only this $100+ blender worked as nicely as it looks I might keep it, but it's going back ASAP.Update: Finally decided to go for it and ordered a Vitamix 5200. Yes, it's expensive, but so far worth every penny. It outperforms every other blender I've tried.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Dog Lover Having Second Thoughts. I am a huge dog lover, but this movie had me looking at canines in a different light for quite some time while I was little. For some reason, I always relate this movie to "Sandlot," but this dog really was ridiculously mean.

Will never buy another Epson!. I have the Epson CX5200 and loved it at first. But everyone is right...it starts to clog and then you have serious problems. I can print black and blue but no yellow or magenta, which means you can't print anything in color. I have tried everything...new cartridges, cleaning the print heads, aligning the heads, etc...nothing works. It seems like several other people have had the same issues with this series. Epson needs to correct this issue before putting other printers on the market! I am now looking for a new printer but you can bet it won't be an Epson!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Stardust. Maroon Killashandra on Doona, have her meet an even more empathic and supportive Sean Shongili, extract all suspense and danger, and you'll have _Nimisha's Ship_. Unlike memorable McCaffrey heroines of yore, Nimisha has no need to grow and change, as she's brilliant, beautiful, poised, and powerful from the early pages. Even being marooned on a planet with defeated exploratory teams barely ruffles her hair or mars her manicure. It's a good thing the early settlers of Pern did not have Nimisha's ship-design skills, as they would have developed a high technological civilization in approximately 25 minutes, and we would have been denied some of McCaffrey's best books.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Self-Indulgent Garbage. Having been a Junior Brown fan since 1991, I looked forward to his new release. Junior is a national treasure, and is arguably the greatest country musician alive today, maybe the best ever. However, I can promise you that this album will never be put in my CD player again. It is an insult to country music fans, and a waste of his talent. I don't object to Junior testing the limits with rock, rock and roll, and rockabilly, it's one of the things he does best. However, this effort belongs in the trash can. This album should have been titled "We Got Really Drunk One Night, Played Some Stupid Songs, And Somebody Left The Tape Recorder On". Don't waste your money on this one. Ernest Tubb wouldn't have.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Smartdigital USB Repeater not 2.0. I just bought two of these. They do work but the throughput is slow. USB 2.0 is supposed to allow for up to 480 Mbs, while USB 1.1 allows for between 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs. These cables clearly state on the back of the package that they support 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs max. Thus they don't perform as 2.0. What this means is whatever you have hitched through this thing will be slowed down; example, I tried to put my webcamera on it (which does 24 Mbs) and my movements are slowed down noticeably.If you look at the cable connector box, they have stuck on a little sticker that says "USB 2.0" in red. The sticker tries to make it look like that was printed on the connector along with the rest of the labeling. Basically, everything points to this being mislabeled, previous generation product. If you want USB 2.0, and you should at this point in time, you should buy another cable, not this one.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Video card not supported? Seriously?. I tried to install this game on a Samsung laptop made in 2011. I have the newest Medal of Honor game installed, made in 2010, as well as Battlefield Vietnam, made in 2004. So I figured installing this game, which is 5 years old, wouldn't be a problem. However, after finally getting the game installed, I received an error message saying that my video card was not supported. If my 2011 graphics card is too outdated for this game, I would like to know how the heck anyone played it in 2007. It makes no sense. I can run an EA game from 2004 and another from 2010 on my video card, so why can't I play one from 2007? Don't buy this unless you are absolutely certain that it will run on your system. Despite being an old game, it is EXTREMELY picky about what systems it will run on.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Good value. Bought this adapter to power my Koolatron fridge when travelling. It works well and is much lighter than my original one (due to the fact that it is solid state based).

Eye-opening story. As an American who has never traveled to Australia, I thought the author painted a very detailed picture of the scenery.

Plenty fo stuff to like, a few misses. How Men Are was, coming on the heels of the Luxury Gap and their massive UK hit "Temptation" something of a challenge. The production had moved from funky to more orchestral in nature, the songs less hook driven and more introspective. Still, I remember this being one of my favorite albums in the late 80s, I constantly played it and grew to love it. The Skin I'm In and Shame Is On the Rocks are classic Heaven 17 songs, full of bright pop sounds and yeah, funky I guess. The album has one of my all time fave Heaven 17 songs "Reputation," a shamefully over looked -should have been a hit single. ...And That's No Lie is a massive, almost Brian Wilson-type epic that has promise but seems half finished.If anything, compared to the first two albums this one is more mature and less hit driven. Some tracks seem like filler, portents of things to come in hindsight. Not a bad album, certainly nothing embarrassing. But just wait...$LABEL$1,0,-100

don't waste your money on Cheap meters!. I have been in the RV repair industry for a long time and one thing is for sure, I cannot do my job without a top quality meter. I have in the past bought Snap-On, Mac, Matco,ect, but have never been as pleased with a meter as I have with this one. Beyond the normal functions of a meter, I love this one for its temp probe, no more are the days of carrying a therometer to take readings inside fride, a/c/ unit, all I do is plug it into the meter put the probe inside and shut the door within 30 seconds I have a very accurate reading. But probably the most important thing about this merter is the "true RMS" readings I get, this is very important when working with power converters and inverters..This meter is very well protected also with fuses (fuses are pricey though) have not blown one yet but I would recommend purchasing a set to keep on hand.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Essential Stravinsky. No student or lover of Stravinsky's music should be without this book. It is a rare opportunity to see into his thought processes, and it makes one realise just how much music meant to him- that he sought to serve it by understanding it as deeply as he could.In communicating this understanding, Stravinsky makes for an engaging, if somewhat challenging, read. The book is a transcript of six lectures given by the composer to French students, and the translators have seen fit to cast his words into a large quantity of "verbal Victoriana." If at times it seems boring, it is all due to that style of language. Apart from that, it is an excellent account on the part of a man who (for all his known self-contradictions) clearly used his heart as well as his hands and his head.For students of Stravinsky, this book is essential. As a record of his personality and thought processes, it takes some beating.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Buyer beware, deceptive invoicing tactics. Hearst Publications sent my mom nasty bills and letters saying she agreed to a renewal which she did not, and which she specifically wrote to them to say she did not want (something she should not even have to do).I would NEVER buy this magazine now that I am aware of their unethical practices.I fear for people without the skills to be able to assert their rights and suspect many go along with the renewal they never wanted and capitulate in the face of the nasty reminder / billing letters.Sad. My mom wonders how someone like Oprah can even be associated with such practices.You can contact Oprah subscriptions at 800-846-4020 apparently but they don't even put the phone number on the invoices and it took me much searching to find it online, no thanks to them.

Within seconds of starting the software there was huge disappointment to see a tiny little window half the size of the screen which was the drawing area. Ok, I thought you should be able to resize it like most modern windows programs. It turns out you can't which I find amazing. 800x600 was the standard nearly 10 years ago. Things have moved on since. Ok, you can change the monitor resolution but this is a pain for my kids to do and frankly it looks terrible - the text is almost unreadable. They should really point out that the resolution can not be changed. I would not have bought this if I had known this before hand. Very disappointed.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Now I have two Motor Ace albums to listen to on my hellish commute, which is a good thing.These guys deserve to make it big in America, if that's what they want.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Toilet-riffic! (And I mean that in a good way!). My family and I just moved to the states from Japan and we brought some Japanese toilet sets with us. The Panasonic model I picked out has a max draw of 460W, and is designed for Japanese power. While the toilet seat worked just fine hooked up to the US power outlet (which is controlled by a light switch, which wasn't on for extended periods), I didn't want to risk using the heated seat or heated water options. Once I got this product, I plugged it in, and have continued to use the toilet seat without issues. (I am still not using the heated seat due to the weather, but the heated water works without problem.)Honestly, I just have to assume it works, since my toilet seat also worked plugged into the wall...but it's supporting the <500W device I plugged into it, so until it breaks, the seat breaks or some other issue arises, I'll give this high marks for doing everything I expected it to do.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Aromatic Ignorance. Ms. Austin obviously has no knowledge of the safe usage of essential oil therapy!

Leaks Like A sieve - Buy something else!!!. I don't often get as angry at an inanimate object as I did at this P.O.C. Only the second time I used the machine, and when I attempted to mount the clean water tank/soap dipanser the clean water just rushed out the bottom of the tank and sturated my carpet in several areas. I've read other reviews on this product which state that the clean water tank cracks and causes the leak.So tonight I'll inspect the clear water tank to see if it is cracked because I suspect it is another problem. If I find out exactly what is the problem I will post the answer on this review board.$LABEL$0,0,-100
a book for the best web comic. Sinfest is the best web-only comic I've read. I've been reading Sinfest since 2002 and I'm surprised that it's still not syndicated.This book contains comics from 2000 and 2001.

Just plain bad. This product is not capable of making double flares for brake lines. I've tried to make at least 25 flares using 3/16" brake line with this thing and all of them were uneven and lopsided. I had a friend try and he had the same result. The brake line was properly prepared before each flaring attempt. Very disappointed, but you get what you pay for.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Blink 182 is the Backstreet Boys of Punk. Note: This is a review of the band as well as the album.That's right. You heard me. I compared your favorite "punk" band to a bunch of no-talent prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. Now why would I go and do a thing like that? Probably because Blink 182 is a bunch of no-talent prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. I can't begin to comprehend why so many people like them. They're just a bunch of stupid frat-boys who sing about their exes and humping dogs. Even songs that show the slightest bit of potential are ravaged by De Longes grating vocals. The fact that they've recieved so much attention from sell-out programs like MTV and TRL should prove the point I'm trying to make and quell any arguments immediately. So please wake up and buy a real punk album like "London Calling" or "Give 'Em Enough Rope."$LABEL$0,0,-100

The Godfather. I loved this book. I read because a friend said it was a good book. I also read it because, I didn't understand the movie. This book has a lot of detail in it. This a great book, for anyone. But I would have little children read this book, because there is sex and violence. It is about the Corleone flamily. They are a New York Mafia family. It is mostly about the head of this family, Don Vito Corleone. He is dies and his son, Micheal becomes the godfather. The reason they are called 'Godfather' is because they are godfather to different people in there family. The movie were based on this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Funny and sexy with a great paranormal twist!. CALDER'S ROSE is a wonderful and funny contemporary romance with a neat paranormal element. When western writer Shane McNamara is teamed up with romance/western author Devin James, the sparks fly. They have completely different writing styles, and opposing viewpoints on how the two main characters should behave. Shane and Devin are also opposites in real life: Shane is a hunky, `live-it-up' type of a guy who wears T-shirts with wild slogans, and Devin is button-down-shirt conservative, and wears her hair in a tight braid. While Shane rises to the challenge of loosening up his writing partner, the characters of their book, Rose and Calder, realize they're going to have to take matters in hand to get the book written, and they come to life in a unique paranormal twist and a book-within-a-book story. Warm, witty, and sexy, CALDER'S ROSE is a definite keeper.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A place for you. Amongst other things this novel is a love letter to Gloucester, MA, its people, its architecture, its world old and new. It's also about the layering of lives and stories that make up history, the accretions of time and of the imagination. Frank brings a unsettled life with him when he comes to the Gloucester of the 1970s, memories of a dead friend and a failed relationship, and builds something more solid amid the many colourful characters who frequent the restaurants and bars along the waterfront. New friends and loved ones are found and old friends and loves are reassessed. All is not how it seems at first. This is a rich novel and an enjoyable one. Buy it!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Ancient Roman history at it's very best! Fascinating!!!!. What a majestic find after 1900 years.

Lomo Super Sampler. This 4 imageLomo camera is a lot of fun. Four images lined up together on one negative make an interesting format. The 'look' of the camera made many people think I was pointing a squirt gun at them! The speed choices are nice but I found myself using only the longer speed. Of course, it is frustrating not to have a real view finderbut simply aiming the camera made for some intersting shots. Personally, I wish the images were divided along the horizontal plane (panoramic) rather than the vertical plane. ....The film advance system and the exposure of each individual lens is inconsistent. In my camera the first image is underexposed by about a 1/2 of a stop and I believe that the film advance gears have already broken contributing to the advance problem. (I have only had the camera for one month.) Overall I would say this is a very expensive plastic toy that does not work well. I like the images but wish the camera worked consistently.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Work as advertised and provide a very nice seat cushion as well. My wife and I were surprised the first time we used these. We took them to a nearby beach which can be cold with the wind coming in off the ocean. Not only did the Lava Buns keep us warmer the gel actually provided a more comfortable seat which was an unexpected bonus.They are not difficult to use, removing the gel pack and placing it into a microwave for heating and then putting it back into the cloth pouches.

Not convinced.... The Author negates most of his premise by starting off saying that Danes are the happiest people on earth. Denmark is very socialist, has incredibly high taxes, and is also very secular. Only 5% of Danes regularly attend Church compared to 43% of Americans.The author's conclusion based on his statistical analysis is that religion and conservatism are the means to a happier nation.It seems like he cherry picks his data to support his conclusion. His analysis is often speculative and surprise surprise, his speculation always supports conservatism and religiosity.It's an interesting read non the less, which is why I gave it two stars. If you are conservative, you'll love how he backs up your beliefs. If you're liberal, you'll leave unconvinced and questioning his methodology.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Short on time AND flavor. I couldn't believe that the other reviews for this book were so positive. Minutemeals is a good book for those who are only looking to top frozen meals and canned soup, not for people who truly enjoy cooking. I tried the manicotti and the chicken chasseur. They were unpleasant and REALLY tasted like they took 20 minutes to make. I pretty much gave up on the book after that. Why not spend a little more time and cook something with some real depth and flavor?This is also a very bad choice for anyone on a budget. 20 minutes comes at a cost: the recipes call for all sorts of pre-made items ("dessert included" often translates into "buy a pre-made cake")Not exactly a celebration of good, fresh food. And I'm a college student with a budding interest in cooking, no Julia Childs. Invest in quality of life, not this book. I wish I had.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Dual purposer here, to keep cold items cold and provide a cool drink later in the day. In the upper half I put in two 32 oz bottles of gatorade (chilled) he claims they stay fairly cool all day, along with a napkin and utensils. The lunch box is very attractive and looks more like a portable tool kit rather than a lunch bag. By far the best lunch box he has ever had! I highly recommend this item!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Boring compilation. Most arrangements are oversimlified and repetitive. Stellar songs are reduced to bland, uninviting arrangements. Its a pretty disheartening collection.

Don't spend extra!. One star isn't for the soundtrack itself, it's for the quality of the packaging. I was hoping that by buying a re-mastered import I'd get a little something in the liner notes. There ARE no liner notes, no lyrics, just a single sheet of flimsy paper with the song titles on it. Buy the domestic; even if it's the same stuff it's nearly 10 bucks cheaper.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Nice sound, as expected. The I-Pod sounds a lot better when connected to the receiver than my laptop computer did. Construction and cables are also good quality.Only one minor item merits some attention from the manufacturer: This device would be a lot more practical if the remote control could operate it just like it does a regular CD player, I did not find it very practical to navigate the large collection I have with the available commands. It owrks, but could be a lot better. All the buttons are there, only a few lines of programming would be required. This would chang my rating to 5 stars.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Hardest Working Band in Austin, Texas. I have seen the Hudsons on a number of occassions in Austin. They are entertaining, have a great sense of humor and are very talented. The are high energy, yet accoustic. The songs they have composed are both witty and tender. Phoebe, the violinist, adds an eclectic element to the band.

Severely disappointed. I'm both a collector and a bibliophile, and this is the first time I've ever thought it necessary to this say about any collector's book: In my opinion, this book stinks. A shame, as it's clear that the author has in-depth knowledge to impart. Unfortunately, it's clouded by the author's apparent dislike of dealers, fellow collectors, and the Homer Laughlin China Company itself.The book designer's work is exuberant and cheerful, much as is Fiestaware; however, the author's text is mean spirited. I don't think I've ever seen an odder combination. I hope for better things from the obviously knowledgeable author in the future.$LABEL$0,0,-100

So So, not all that exciting!. It may have 4,000 fonts but alot of them are basically different versions of the same font. A little skinnier, a little fatter, bold, italics etc etc. Some fonts literally have dozens of different styles, yet it's still the same font. It doesn't take long to add up to 4,000 when you do that. If your looking for fun, funky, cool fonts, don't get this, they aren't on here. OK, that's a lie, there aren't very many. It all depends on your tastes. There are alot of good fonts on here, and it's well worth the price to have them all in one place.

Reads like a mental health textbook. Why is romance and entertainment built on such a sad topic as alcoholism? LUCY IS GETTING MARRIED is the kind of book that begs for an answer to this quetion.It's no secret that a deep hopelessness and despair is what every alcoholic suffers. The drunk state gives some degree of relief from the pain of facing reality and other emotional conflicts. It's a kind of sedative. Lucy needs a sedative at times, thus gets drunk herself. Probably too often. Lucy at age 17 had clinical depression. Is this really the stuff that romantic comedy is made of?This book is interesting to read but not as comedy - it's too sad for that.$LABEL$1,0,-100
"I e-mail like a Baroness?". The disc was mediocre up to this line, then the bottom fell out. I am fan of Queen, that's the only reason this get's more than one star. The music is awkwardly shoe-horned into the story, with some lyrics re-written to fit better (ie "Radio Ga-Ga" and the already mentioned butchering of the classic "Killer Queen"). The vocal talents are good but sound... off with this material. While any Queen is better than no Queen sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Very Functional. This book has great insight into what it takes to be a creative author. My only complaint is the content of some of the sample stories.

Not as Shown on the Box. I got this and am really not too thrilled. Let's look at my list of gripes:1. What you actually GET is NOT what is shown in this illustration or even on the box. This tool does NOT come with the pictured tool holder that provides additional stabilization and support. Even though the holder is CLEARLY shown and there is an insert about it in the box, it ain't there.Without the holder, your Dremel is ponly attached to the "table" with a a collar at the top of the tool that is secured with e hex nut. This leaves the body of the tool unsupported and that much linear mass makes for easy deflection when working harder woods.2. Once you have mounted the "table" to a support surface correctly mounting the tool into the holder is a real challenge (I guess I have big fingers)3. The precision of the fence and depth adjustments is really hit or miss as most of the assenbly is plastic.Overall I give it a 2 -- mostly for false inducement.$LABEL$0,0,-100

quite happy with it. I've owned a lot of insulated bottles. This is my favorite, for sure. It has a very solid feel. The rubberized grip is a nice touch. I loaded it with green tea, and five hours later the temperature seemed just the same as when I put it in.The slightly larger size is a plus. It allows you to put in two full cups without worrying about spilling, and your drink is not in contact with the plastic stopper for hours.Definitely better than my previous system of using an old juice bottle and reheating in a microwave.It seems like a bit of money for something like this, but the cost will soon be forgotten while the quality will be enjoyed for a long time to come.$LABEL$1,0,-100

From Salvador Agron to making us groan. I'm another of those who has enjoyed Paul Simon's work for a long time, so I was anxious to hear this latest CD. After making myself listen to it several times, all I can say is "Huh?". These songs range from OK (That's where I belong, Senorita, Old) to bad (Lorraine, Pigs Sheep & Wolves) to incomprehensible (the Teacher) to unlistenable (Quiet). The only positive thing I can find here is some of the instumental work is nice. But, those lyrics! I'd much rather hear about the Girl from New York City who calls herself a human trampoline than the frog in South America whose venom is an antidote for pain. (Hey, did I just make a rhyme there?) I hope this isn't Paul Simon's last album, as it would be a poor coda to an otherwise great body of work. I give this CD one star because of the music, with the second awarded as a sentimental one because it's by Paul Simon.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Gory horror. It's really my fault that I haven't done more research before deciding to read this book right after the Book of Lost Things. They are very different. The Book of Lost Things is a gentle, dark yet hopeful and touching retelling of old fairytales interposed onto a boy's life. Nocturnes is a series of gory, gutty, gritty horror tales. It may be your thing but it definitely isn't mine. I confess I didn't finish the book but the first three stories turned me off completely. The Cancer Cowboy Rides seemed an attempt at copying works by H.G. Wells and Stephen King.

Excellent Pocket Size Traveler. I also was in the region as a earlier poster puts it. With this Croatian or Hrvatski dictionary if you please. Firstly this Croatian dictionary is not favored to Serbian, this is blatantly untrue. As well as the fact that the official script/text for Serbian is Cyrillic. The earlier given example of bread as sensitive, which I checked in this Croatian dictionary, clearly shows the word "Kruh" ,which is the correct Croatian word for bread. In regards to lacking several words and explanation of others, I also suspect this to be untrue, because the earlier poster would be able to provide specific examples and clearly failed to provide evidence of this. I found this Croatian dictionary extremely thorough for its handy pocket size with over 30,000 entries.$LABEL$1,0,-100
