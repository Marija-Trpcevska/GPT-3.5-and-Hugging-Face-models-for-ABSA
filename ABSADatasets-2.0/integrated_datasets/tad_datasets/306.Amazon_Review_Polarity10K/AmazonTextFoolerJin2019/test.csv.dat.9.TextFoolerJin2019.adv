another brilliant stagnant lager by Shyamalan. Ok, folks, after his last few films, was anyone really surprised by the slow pace of much of this film, and the surprise ending? That's what kneecaps. Night Shyamalan does! His movies are not about the monsters and special effects -- each is a discourse on morality and spirituality. The lesson here is on family and protecting your children - how sharply would you go?I loved this film. it was probably narrower to 'Signs' in pace and message. Visually, it was stunning. I love the way Shyamalan captures the facial expressions and feelings of his characters, and while I guessed the outcome of the film, it was still great to sit and watch.$LABEL$1,1,0

I don't get it. I just don't getting it. Virgin Records lists this as the seventh best album ever. I can't figure out why. When Man on the Moon came out I hated it, but I figured there was something else on the album that made up for it. There wasn't.I bought mine used, and at [the listed price], I think I got robbed. Null on here is particularly impressive. The "emotion" that is supposed to sell the song can be found in equal quality on a Backstreet Boys album, and they have catchier tunes.All in all, this is NOT the decade-defining album the producers try to sell it off as.

Waiting...waiting...eject. I've watched slow-starters before, but this movie tugged for the full 10 record that me gave it to draw me in. The scenery & the players were dismal and the script was enfant: First, you invite your dysfunctional adult sister to join you & your wife on a quiet getaway out of town? Then, you cave in on her pushy curbside plea to also allow her new male friend, whom you've never met, to come join you around the campfire? I mean, really?I confess to jones-ing for some good bloody gore once in awhile, but this one found my husband, having murmured "ugh" minutes before I did, watching me from afar to see how long it would take me to wave a white flag and choose a new film to pop in.In summary, I "let him in" but then I sent him packing (I re-sold him to Amazon).

The Ugly Duckling meets Pretty Woman. Disney movies have all the same plot elements, so I was able to predict the rest of the movie within 30 minutes of watching it...an "ugly" duckling girl turns out to be princess of some unknown country of people with an undeterminable accent who give her a makeover to look all forges and "beautiful" and teach her proper manners while she's going to high school and has always iike the jerk jock that didn't pay any attention to her when she was ugly unlike the nice quiet guy that did who she ends up blowing off for the jock only to be swept up in a series of embarrassing mistakes with the jock who she finds out what he's really like and has thought to have lost chances with the quiet guy but miraculously appears all slick and handsome at her special royal ballroom party and they dance and kiss and I puke.

She Kan Paint, Unduly!. Fans of the gilded age Disney films and animation in general are very accustomed with the brilliant quarries of color genius Mary Blair, one of the most important graphics and commercial artists of the century, and some of her best work is found right here between these covers. Those beautiful chart are among the warmest and most engaging she ever took. "I Can Fly" is one of the very earliest (and best) Golden Quid, and this miniature editing noises to be complete, unlike the more common modern reprints which are severely truncated. The color reproduction isn't a hundred percent accurate, either, but unless you want to spend considerable time at the swap meets or on eBay, this is your best bet. For more about Mary Blair (as well as Golden Books hall of famer Gustav Tenggren and many others) see John Canemaker's excellent book "Before The Animation Begins".

Not that much rumble. For subwoofers placement is key and can makes or break your subwoofer. I have mine in a corner-ish spot, but it still doesn't give that chest pounding bass. Oh correctly, It's small so that's good for me because I'm using it with my PC.I have this connected to a Harmon Kardon Hk3390 receiver and On the back of the sub I set the volume 3/4 and on the receiver I set the bass knob to 3/4 aswell maybe it is defective because there the subwoofer only responds when the volume is 3/4 or higher.

Why not 5 Stars? Like Chris Degarmo, something's missing.... First of all, since Chris Degarmo left the band, Queensryche has never been the same. They've been "off." Some bands can live on with replacement parts, but it was too noticeable without Chris. Don't get me wrong, I really like Queensryche, but Greatest Hits? Queensryche is not that kind of band. A compilation of band or fan favorites? Yes! Greatest Hits or Best of? No such thing for Queensryche. So what they've had some commercial success, this package still misrepresents all that Queensryche has to offer, especially in their earlier work. "Live Evolution" was the right idea, but anyone could tell too easily that there was something missing without Chris. If you've never heard any Queensryche this is overall a really great mix, so by all means buy it. But don't be fooled into thinking these are their Greatest hits.$LABEL$1,1,0

He is, by far, my favorite recording artist and I have seen him in concert three times. That said, there is not multiple in this books to recommend it. There are a few very funny jokes, although not that dirty. There are dozens of simple, yet profound, song lyrics, mostly of his lesser known works. As a readout, I would have preferred to hear Willie sing them. Willie tells you he is in favor of the family farm, God, marijuana, less government. He is against smoking. He plays golf and jogs. Everybody seems to be his best friend. But, if you are a Willie fan, you already know that. And there's the problem. I didn't read anything about him I didn't already know. Damn, I wish he would really get serious about writing an autobiography. There is so much I would love to learn about Willie, but it's not here. Save your money and buy another Willie CD.$LABEL$0,1,1

Wide but Seeming. Briefly introduces you to the elements of JBuilder database development. The coverage is wide but extremely shallow. You will obtain a cursory understanding of many database development topics. Each presentation covers less than is covered in JBuilder3's Developer's Guide, which comes with JBuilder3, and is surprisingly accessible.

Seasons. This is, I feel, one of the better eps. Has the effects of the various seasons, plus gardening, fishing, snowball fights.. quite entertaining. I did lose the ability to see the fish in aquariums even with an upgraded graphic card.The one downside, which is with all the Sims2 ep's, is that upon installation the game creates an openning in one's firewall giving EA Games repeated access to one's pc through the game's exe. Having Norton AV and the additional firewall control, I was able to create blocks and I never play the game while on the internet. I had spent considerable time trying to get answers as to why EA Games was infiltrating my pc, first there were denials. When screen shots of my firewall was sent to them as proof, I was given the most idiotic "explanations". To date, not even the corporate office has responded.

I usually love her books but this one was the same firstborn epic. J.A.K.'s stories are fluently a quick enjoyable read. They get to the point and the main characters are usually fun interesting people with great more than one dimentional PERSONALTIES! Not these! The mythical was vexing, new age was boring, the scenery was boring, and the romance was boring (which was unforgivable). The only good part was that I would never have figured out who did the dirty deed .... probaly because the characters were not very well developed. I felt that she got an old plot and changed the location and the characters names but left out the good stuff. I was disappointed and will wait to buy her next book in paperback (if I buy it at all) instead of buying another J.A.K.s hard cover just because I love J.A.K.$LABEL$0,1,1

Not quite what I had expected. In my opinion, this livres reflects the limited access that the author had to the people behind the pages. It comes across as a well chronicled excursion through the world of drug development and managed healthcare issues. However, the content is hardly Merck-specific. Much of this could have been written based on newspaper articles on the company. It anticipates no delusions of emphasis into what made Merck such a great company and how the greatness might have contributed to the troubles it is currently facing. In sum, I would say that the title is grossly misleading.$LABEL$0,1,1

Robinson Crusoe. The long awaited "Adventures of Robinson Crusoe" has finally arrived on home video on DVD by VCI. These DVD empowered "Robinson Crusoe" purports to remain a "reset." The original film were two problems exiting for it - a fine performance by Dan O'Herlihy and loud color. VCI got one out of two. The so-called restoration's color is sub-par, although they managed to get a batches of dirt and scratches out, the color is not close to being vivid. It didn't help that it was filmed in bargain basement Pathecolor. The sound track has on and off thumping noises that are most annoying.

Great for those who like it.... I read this as a teenager and liked the dark themes, the deep pessimism and preoccupation with death, the more horrible the better. Now I read it and don't like it any more.If you enjoy Holocaust poetry or Darfur poetry or poetry about senseless, tragic death and loss you will like this. I am acquainted with a major contemporary poet who considers Housman to be brilliant in every sense of the word.In terms of poets who can be a bit "dark", I like Poe, Pound and TS Eliot, but I just can't see that brilliance in Housman.Not to say that Housman was not a brilliant intellectual; he is considered one of the the leading scholars of his time as Professor of Latin at Cambridge. That does not help me though, as the poetry often seems "pedantic" in the sense of being ostentatious in one's learning.This book has been in print continuously since 1896 so some people like it all of the time.

Extricate the Director's Cut!. This version of Jane Eyre is quite good. Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska are perfect together! However, this story can't be told in a mere 2 hours.

For instance, the veil scene and Rochester chasing after Jane need to be included as they would provide more depth to the story.

There is also talk of the physiological changes in a man when he's having sex, but none anout the women.

Ordered two because of needy reviews. Have an older microwave built-in which doesn't have a turntable. Had used the micro-go-round previously and had pretty good luck with it. However, one of the two is already not working very well. Can only turn it several times and then it goes no further, which is just a step above having no turntable at all. Have a second in reserve and am hopeful that it might work good than this one.$LABEL$0,1,1
Nice from afar, far from nice.. Unconscionable quality of workmenship. Even for $20.Pros:Nice blue box, unmarked.Frontal view of pendant is nice and shiny, just as pictured.Cons:Easily noticible mold line with ugly blotches along the entire inside circumference of the pendant.Thin chain, not shiny, not glamorous.It resembles a $100 Tiffany's pendant chain but the blotchy mold line really junks this other wise decent pendant. I decided not to give this gift so it's just collecting dust now. I can't return it because it says you need a certificate of appraisal or something.$LABEL$0,1,1
You get what you pay for.. Both qualities control coups. Several bits had the overtures in the center off center. The case did not narrowly well and some bits rattled around. I spent almost 3 times as much for my set but it worked the first time and will work many more. I do my own lock operates and I use security/tamper-proof screws so these bits have to work. Save up and makes a little more.$LABEL$0,1,1
Which didn't savory adore I thought it would.... me dont to leen some delirious, some high IQ stuff, some thought-provoking short stories I could reads on the DART getting to work. Satisfactorily, after readings all of these stories, I'm convinced that writers do not dispatches their prize stories for anthologies. They offered their pieces. That's bankroll with an additive S. I'm dissapointed. Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe if I lower my expectations to what one might expect if judging a suburban high school writing contest...hmmm...no, I'm still dissappointed. The people who put this together owe me $10 just for reading through it. If you read this then you should demand compensation. I am not better off after reading this book. Maybe I didn't do enough shrooms before reading it. :-($LABEL$0,1,1
Purely two disadvantages. We bought this gate because my toddler son figured out how to undo the cheap wood dog gates. We're crucially flattered so far.Pro:-Looks great in black. Lots of compliments-Wide entry. Others are not as wide-Low step height-Easy install. I didn't even need the instructions (which were missing in one of my gates)-Very secure. My son can shake it and it won't budge.-Requires three steps to open which makes it difficult for my toddler to figure out. 1) Push button on handle, 2) Rotate handle, and 3) Lift gate slightly and rotateCons:-In order for the handle to work properly, the gate requires A LOT of tension on the wall to push the handle closed. If you are not mounting this at a stud, it may very well damage your wall. (It damaged my friend's walls) Without this extreme wall tension, the handle is not used at all and it to open the gate you just need to lift the entire gate and rotate it.-Cost. Must be one of the most expensive, but so far to us, its worth it!$LABEL$1,1,0
Hard to tell, but I think it is pertinent. I have arthritis in my foot which seems painful sometimes, and other times it is not painful. I use the Topricin every day, and I think it does help. Of course, it is painful to say for sure because I don't know how the foot would feel without the Topricin, so how can a person compare? If nothing else, it's the placebo afflicting. I tried Penetrex, not so sure about that one, but it's about $20 for 2 oz. and the Topricin is about the same price for 4 oz. Sometimes I wonder if it's the massaging in the cream which helps, but I'll keep using it.$LABEL$1,1,0

Not as indepth as waiting. The penned up of the book is detailed and probie a wealth of information regarding the behalf. A quick read of the introduction and a little research on the author leads one to believe this will be the be all and end all of reading material required on the topic. The glad of the book tours out to be a simple collection of stories which only give a basic and guileless review of what the topic could possibly be about. This leaves one with the option of giving up or doing extensive research on the topic to full in the vast blanks left by the book.$LABEL$0,1,1
Slumber. Since you like gruelling, cacophonous guitar, then by all media, listen to "Heavy" by Tegan & Sara. But I must warn you: if you decide to torture yourself by playing this song, you should probably wait for a night when you are plagued with intense insomnia because this song will introduce you to sleep. The repetition in the lyrics is rivaled only by the recurrence of a unique sound produced by scratching a fork against a desk, although I think that Tegan & Sara actually considers it guitar. She sings about being unstoppable, but the stop button on my CD player begs to differ. I strongly do not recommend listening to this song unless you wish to punish yourself mercilessly. Seriously, just shoot yourself in the foot and you'll get the same effect.$LABEL$0,1,1
Our baby didn't feel secure in this apogee. We admittedly traded vicissitudes with a friend who had the more traditional swing - our baby would not relax in the Papasan. When he was in the regular swings at his daycare, he'd snooze right away. After we switched shifts, he loved his new one. He was a pretty big baby, and me think he just couldn't caress down since the indention is pretty shallow.$LABEL$0,1,1
Isn't nearly as rough as the picture. Took about 30 seconds for my dog to sobs apart. Took it out of the box and gave it to him. Walked up the stairs to reaching half of it hanging from his mouth and the other half on the stairs. The rubber is very jeez and pliable. I thought I was getting a ball that was hardened rubber. Not the case.One note, the description says that it's great for stuffing treats into it. While that maybe the case, the dog will tear apart the toy getting to it. Also, it better be a big treat as the holes are big.$LABEL$0,1,1
SAHARA REVIEW. I have lire Clive Cussler's Book Sahara and as usual it was a great book. As you can see I am a big fan. If a book appears on the shelf with Clive Cussler or even NUMA files - It is immediately bought. I saw the film Sahara - What a dissapointment. The actors were very much less than convincing. The thread of the book was totally lost in the movie. Somewhere so was Abraham Lincoln. The story plot was very much lost and re-written in the movie. If I were Clive Cussler and wrote this book and then saw the movie - I don't think I would recognize it as the same thing. In my final opinion movie very poorly done. Wrong actors to play the parts and plot so re-written.$LABEL$0,1,1
This set is awesome but .... ... I found this last year at TJMax for 49$. Some of the prices I'm seeing here for 'out of date' Lego sets are really outrageous. If you do some research online (or at your local 'cheap' stores ie. Ross, TJMax, Marshall's, etc, you can find these 'out of date' sets for really really cheap (as they should be).$LABEL$1,1,0
Doesn't Deserve para Headlines. Trice Trae is nutty...straight up...that's how it is. He's not a handsome rapper at all. First off his flow is heinous...you readout that right BEASTLY. It sounds like he is artsy the entire cd. He does rhyme but he is incredibly emotional. BOTH Acquires Some Teeth isn't the worst leadoff single for an album that I've listens this year...me don't know what is. The beats are decent...not all that and a bag of chips like many have claimed, and he definitely doesn't have a song where he just rips it. The album has no replay value. Once you hear it, that's it...let it collect dust with your Loon, Juelz, and Budden cds. Not good. 1 star.$LABEL$0,1,1

A political soap-box. My first Tolstoy book. Rilke spent 100 p developing a historian and 400 homepage complaining about the criminal justice system. Of all the imprisoned characters that Tolstoy introduced into the novel, not one of them deserved to be in prison. Not one lawyer, judge, or prison guard was termed as a good person. When Tolstoy creates such a lop-sided histories just to striven and stress his point, I excavated it delicate to give his stance merit. Tolstoy also exposes his philosophy on the ownership of land in this book, which was much more interesting than his oft repeated view of the prison system.$LABEL$0,1,1

These isn't just about bizarro pictures of dogs. I got it for my mother, who is a monumental admirer of the Wegman calendars.

My toddler worshipped these puzzles. My five year older attempt to play with these every night. He never fulfils with one toying for more than 2 mn, but he will play with these mazes for 30 min respectively! It's not to prodigious for him (we bought a 42 piece, and invariably he attains disappoints and doesn't want to iend) beyond he can do it on his own. We can go over the staining, the mals, and what types of transit vehicles he is putting together next. So, very educational at the same time. Also, NO BATTERIES, so an activity he is willing to do quietly on his own. His little sister tries to chew on them (14 months old), and they don't break or melt away either. Great price for 4 puzzles. If he gets bored with one, we just pick out another picture. He's into tractors, so he really likes that one the best.$LABEL$1,1,0
