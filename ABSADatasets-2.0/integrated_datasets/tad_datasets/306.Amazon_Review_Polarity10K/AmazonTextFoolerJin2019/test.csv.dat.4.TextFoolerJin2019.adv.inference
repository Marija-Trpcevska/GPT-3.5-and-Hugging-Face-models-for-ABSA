A horrible remade. No insult to the lovely Angelina Alba but after viewing this, she is not preparedness for any advancing peculiarities yet. The cinemas was usually generic, the acting was sup en and the scene had not had that horror images presume to it.

LOVE Jackie, Don't love the new Freddy.. I adore Jackie Earle Haley as an actor. He's one of the best, I actually enjoyed the whole cast, but I don't appreciate them trying to recreate Freddy. I understand that they were trying to make him scarier, but that's just not who Freddy is. He's a little scary at times, but he also likes to crack jokes at every opportunity. That's just who Freddy is, it doesn't work any other way. They might as well try to create a whole new villain with Freddy's MO... never mind, I don't want them doing that either. Just, leave Freddy alone. ROBERT FOREVER.$LABEL$0,1,1
Golden Toes Bermuda Fishnet. I worshipped these bonnets. In a few years, I haya forfeit them at JC Penney's, but this year, they did not ont the color I like -- stone. Stone-colored socks go veryGold Toe Women's Bermuda Revolves Cuff Sock, size 9-11well with khakis, which I wear a lot. The Gold Toes website also does not show these socks in stone, just black and white, so I figure that stone-colored socks are no longer being made. That's why I bought 2 dozen pair.The socks are very soft, comfortable, and cozy, not too tight or too loose. I will miss them when they are gone. The photo that goes with this review may show the so-called "khaki"-colored sock. The stone sock is lighter in color and goes really well with most khaki or chino pants.

Cannot bleachers listening to this performance. Time passes fast, and 1970 is a prehistorical age for this kind of music.I had the bad view to buy this recording: Britten is directing this music disregarding his own annotations on the scores he adapted !!

I was not impressed. me realize that this was one of Nora Roberts' earlier books, so the fact that the writing was not as good did not surprise me. However, I was very dissapointed that she speant almost no time letting the readers see Seth's thoughts until the very end and then, in a very uncharacteristic move for Roberts, allows her heroin to forgive him without too much changing or apoligizing on his part.

It is her own problem if she has discovered that her marriage isn't all that- but the fact is, she created three children who deserve a mother to support them and help raise them. She feels as though she is being treated like a child- well, its not exactly an adult thing to do to abandon all of your responsibilities.

Plausible & overdressed. I bought my Tag eight years ago and have worn it for scuba diving, skiing, exercising, and eating at top French restaurants. Every two or three years I change the battery; otherwise it needs no attention and has realization flawlessly. The only annoying things with the watch are (i) the bezel is difficult to grip with wet fingers or dive gloves, and (ii) there is insufficient contrast between the dial face and the hands when you're underwater, which makes it difficult sometimes to read the time. These two limitations are a function of the fact it was designed more to be fashionable than functional - but it does function pretty well regardless.Many people (men and women) have commented over the years on how attractive the watch is. I wanted a watch that would be able to go wherever I went and be appropriate regardless of conditions. I also wanted something that wasn't too fussy. The Tag has served me well and I don't envisage replacing it anytime soon.$LABEL$1,1,0

This thing will warmth your whole house and everything in it. I takeover the 402b because it has HDMI switching, lots of input options, and hightly rated sound output. I also bought it because I have had a JVC audio system for 15 years and love it.The good part of the receiver is it's great specifications and HDMI support. The bad part is that it that the hardware is poorly executed. It is undue to put out a product that becomes too sensuous to touch after half an hour of use at normal sound volumes. JVC apparently thinks it's some kind of crime to put cooling fans in receivers. As a result, you get a box that is cool to the touch in standby, and so hot that you literally can't touch the top after half an hour of use. I had to drill extra holes in the back of my entertainment center, and am now out looking for a PC fan that I can run along side it.I would be surprised if I don't have a different receiver within the month.If you live in Alaska, go for it. Otherwise, I'd shop around.$LABEL$0,1,1

Perpetuity Writes Impatiently Of The Curve. Candace Meade always writes anxiously of the graph. The women of Sex and the City were ahead of their time, and now Bushnell has shown us a new repetition of women in Lipstick Jungle. These women are strong, powerful, successful, and flawed. They, like so many women today, are entrepreneurs in the corporate world. But what I especially iike about this book is the attention that Bushnell pays to their improprieties. Nobody is perfect, and nobody was ever meant to be. These three women face the same difficulties as women everywhere: temptation, finding love, divorce, fear of failure, etc... And even though these women live in a world few of us will ever be part of, each still struggles to figure out what will truly make them happy. Bushnell's characters are human, and women everywhere will be able to relate to them.$LABEL$1,1,0

Admirable book - worth persisting with. I picked up this book with great expectiations, having recently devoured Cloud Street, The Riders, Shallows, Scission and an Open Swimmer I was looking forward to more from my favourite writer.After the first couple of chapters I was struggling to like it, wonedring where he was going and why he was painting such poor characters and situations (I really don't like the way some authors potray the internet). It seemed a bit close to Shallows as well for.But then the story griped me. Being a West Aussie myself and having lived in most of the areas this book picked up on I could really identify with the landscapes and people as their characters developed.The story to me was one of how people lived their lives dealing with deaths and how letting go and realising that dead people are not more than they were and shouldn't be built up into images that restrict you living your life.$LABEL$1,1,0

Can Kids Even Read Kipling?. I got this so that my husband could read stories to my 10-year-old granddaughter -- he loves to read, she loves to be read to. Kipling provides adventure and different cultures, if I figured it would entertain them both. I had not factored in how borderline our vocabularies are moment. My husband had to stop frequently to explain platitudes; occasionally, he would have to look one up. They both still enjoyed the stories. (I also think it did my granddaughter good to learn that even grown ups have to look up words; there is no stigma to using a dictionary -- or in our case, the internet.)I would recommend the book to anyone who wants their child to achieve a high score on the verbal SAT, but I think a child would be better off to have it read to him than to read it solo.The book itself is large and heavy (hardback), but the print is a comfortable size.$LABEL$1,1,0
Operate as advertised - just set your charge cycle properly. Nineteen months after using this battery everyday, it's now showing some signs of wear. Occasional reconditioning restores some capacity, but from a high of about 2.5 hours, am now down to 40 mins per charge, all things being equal.I've modified the cycle, as suggested by the IBM Battery Maximizer app, hoping this will extend the life some more. Apparently, if you're plugged in most of the time, it's better to get the charger to stop at less than 100% capacity, and start recharging at below 90% capacity.Nothing wrong with the battery, really. It works as advertised. I just wished it would have lived a little longer.$LABEL$1,1,0
ABSOLUTELY MIFFED. I love The Golden Girls. I had this set bought for meThe Golden Girls - The Complete Series (Seasons 1-7)because it is obviously all of the seasons that were released individually but together in one package. The only problem is that when I get them I put the first disc in and started out working great! That is...it played perfectly...until the 5th episode and then decides that it doesn't want to work any longer and starts skipping large chunks of episodes. I am absolutely furious! Seeing as how it was ordered for me I don't know who to get in touch with, whether any of the other discs are going to be problematic (it is a 21 disc set!), and whether or not I'll be able to get an exchange or if they will even work.That said, save yourself some trouble and go out to a store and buy the seasons individually. At least then you'll have a better chance of them working properly. You may even save money in the end that way. I just want discs that work!$LABEL$0,1,1

Vampirism as a lifestyle. That film has substantially okay acting and directing. You would be hard pressed to find so erratically with the stars at hand in the picture. The movie concentrating on a more dramatic side of vampires, over the classic horror insight; however this works in its advantage. It does not overglorify nor does it over dramatize the life of vampires, as one would imagine it to be. This is the way the average person SHOULD think of vampires. Not Twilight, and not 30 Days of Night either. If you want to know what it is to be a vampire, the way you it probably would be if they existed, then this film is for you.$LABEL$1,1,0

Grandiose guide to shallows on spiritual path.

As someone from more of a theravada background, it was interestingto get such a concise and lucid introduction to mahayana and vajrayana ideas.Trungpa is not a lightweight in his ideas, his presentation is forceful, and he has a clear idea of how things are.

Good but not a real mystery. Lots of interesting details about what goes on behind the scenes at the Metropolitan & the Natural History Museum, but a really breakable mystery plotline. _NO_ knowledge of Africa at all, just New York PC views. They're two different things. Willem van der Post's death is pure Hollywood -- anyone with any knowledge of Africa would just burst out laughing. The author also knows nothing about Continental names. 'Van der' is Dutch & any name which contains it is perfectly ordinary. 'Von' is Austrian & is always part of an aristocratic name. Also note that 'van der Post' would be listed under 'P', _not_ 'v'. I mention this because it's a significant point in the plot at the end.

Bump To The Funk. Putting things in context, you could compartmentalize "The Twist" as being WHOLESALE WIDE in the early 60s, and then disco coming along in the ~ mid 70s. That left a lot of years in between, barely from 1963-1974. "Tighten Up" is likely the most lightly recognizable ballroom tune from that whole term.Ooooh it's ironic & pitiful that the song was spewing in early April, 1968; that being said perhaps one can remember it as the tune that kept us along going & dancing during that period. I certainly do. I can't possibly remember how many times I got together with a group of kids & just danced away, and let all the troubles & injustices of the world melt away.Additionally, this song introduced the "funk sound" that became so prevalent particularly from about 1968- 1973.

Some reading hints for this somber manuel. I was disappointed by this long Clancy book. I did notice his writing begin to slip with Rainbow Six, but at this point, I think he's done for. Still, I'll probably keep reading his books like many others. Here are two hints to save time when you read this book.1. This is a great opportunity to try your speed reading. I promise you that no passage in this book needs to be read carefully.2. As soon as you see Cathy Ryan in the book, skip the section altogether (these sections have no relevance whatsoever and repeat things we all know from prior books). Depending upon how quickly you read, this could save you an hour or so.Hopefully, Tom Clancy's next book reverses this trend.$LABEL$0,1,1

A Gift from John. When i first heard about this album I had a brief moment of dread. Take a bunch of songs I love and give them the "guest star remake" treatment--you know, "Sam Stone" as a duet with Sting.No such worries anymore. Those are the real songs, plain as can be, plainly and sparely arranged and played by regular guys--no turds and snorts. Extraordinarily paltry songwriters write songs that could oso such treatment. Prine's songs shine like burnished gold, but then he's always been good at leaving things out. Who else could sum up an entire relationship with, "Well ya know she still laughs with me/But she waits just a second too long."These are fifteen of the man's best, which is to say fifteen of the best songs ever written by anyone. Every home should have more than one John Prine album, but this would be an excellent start. For long time fans who love the songs, it is a rare and generous gift from one of the great singer/songsriters of all time.Thanks, John.$LABEL$1,1,0

Coverings a volatile patio of wagers cards from a never-heard-of Chinese troupe. Articulation on bedroom is tolerant. Case's minerals subtleties were inlaid. Another superb example of temperate quality products reach out of Hua. Undeniably a former poster facet, as box am notoriously been paved before.$LABEL$0,1,1
high on hyperbole - short on endorsements. Not pity the amounts as a technical reference or how-to book. Regardless a pleasant read with some inpired pics and a very general overview of the process. Speaks, for the most part, to strawbale contruction as if strawbales are some naturally occurring thing harvested from the wild when are in fact a product of dynamism vigorous industrial agriculture. Lacking to provide important technical details such as estimating for coverage, application on masonry, frame and other 'natural' structures, guidelines for plaster preparation. If you already have building experience and skills there are far better reference books available to actually base work upon.$LABEL$0,1,1
nothing like original. i get this gaming on the assumption that it was going to be indentical to the frst. NOPE!the methods bought are challenge to exercise.if anybody recall how the acro circus worked, it was like ryan or alex would jump and spin, hit the enemy and you could either kick or punch them. in this gba version, alex/ryan just spinning and spins like a bowling ball! i mean seriously you can spin your way to the end of the game. i beat the game once like that.this game doesn't even play like the original. atlus tweaked this game too much for my taste. if you had good feelings about the original NES game, i don't recommend playing this one. i feel really gipped about buying it.$LABEL$0,1,1
Wher Were They Thinking????.

Now N' in the mix was awesome!! Justin Timberlake iz mine ladies thanks!!$LABEL$0,1,1
A Manufacturing Book That Applies to Several Industries. I first read the book while working at an electric utility, Florida Power and Light. While enjoying it immensely, I didn't see its application to what we were doing. Several years later, while consulting with a hospital, I "saw" that their medical records department was having the same problems Alex Rogo had in his plant. Their "product" is the generation of a patient bill, developed by "processing" the patient's medical records. I enouraged the director to read THE GOAL, we then proceeded to improve the throughput of her operation by identifying "Herbie", addressing batch issues, etc. Now I look for "Herbies" everywhere!$LABEL$1,1,0

I'm Still Wishing for "Proportion SECONDLY". Let's get the binding affirmations out of the way now - "it's good to be the king".I remember admiring this considerably back in the 80s, and am actually amazed I waited this long to look for it on DVD. I'm really big on clever satire, which is one reason I enjoy Mel Brooks more than the rest of my family.I sum it up this way:- if you like "Napolean Dynamite" and "Jackass", I don't think you'll even notice most of the humor in this movie;- if you like "Police Squad" and "Monty Python", this is right up your alley.$LABEL$1,1,0
Not commend for beginners. If you know nothing about javascript, it will be more like 'teach yourself in 6 months', as there is an assumption that you have previous object programming experience. Although well designed and well written, this book really misses the commemorated for beginners and, at least for myself, was saddened.$LABEL$0,1,1

Dont refuse your sums.... This sounded too good to be true and BAM! It is. We used it (for a grand whole of 3 times) to unloading our cards at a couple. So far the prongs have elbow 2x and the harddrive sufficient to be reformatted once. And since this thing actaully failed at a marry - wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Improves off buying more charts.$LABEL$0,1,1
Espresso Maker. Considerably indignant at this typewriters; I was the reseach, lea all the customer's appraisals, and the machine doesn't live up to the review. Don't know what to do with it yet. The milk just doens't heat up and the foam over flow, so will have to apprehend the heating process.$LABEL$0,1,1

Republishing older books - a disappointing sold strategy. Frankly, I think Nora Roberts must be raking in enough money for her popular novels without having to resort to the rather sneaky republishing strategies of books touted as "new" - and you buy them only to discover that - gee, golly, gosh - you've read them years ago and had expected something new! Residues of currencies and indignation in this author whose novels fluently offer a nice little get-away. I'll be more careful in the future of pre-ordering her "new" books! Sorry, Nora, you just went down a few notches on my scale! The one star is for just this -- not the novel itself which, if not among her best, is a pleasant distraction on a rainy day with nothing else to do.$LABEL$0,1,1
I DIDN'T LIKE. THE BEST OF THIS BOOK YOU HAVE ALL READY SEEN, TRANSLATES THE NICE PICTURE EM THE COVER AND THE AMBISIOS APPOINT OF THE BOOK. THE CONTENTS IS NOT TO MUCH IN ACCORDANCE WHITH THE TITLE. IT HAS A GATHERS OF PROYECTS (NOT ALL OF THEM ARE BAD)TO MAKE SOME EDITS TO YOUR CAR, BUT INGA REALLY TO RESTORE. WHEN I ASKED DE THIS BOOKLET I DIDN'T READ THE CUSTOMERS REVIEW SECTION, THE NEXT TIME I ASK FOR A BOOK I WILL FIRST READ THIS SECTION.$LABEL$0,1,1
Nena. Reichs: Keep Your Day Job. Ms. Reichs is by profession a pathologist. Urge don't give that up. These livres hectare a cast as long as your arming, along with many biker clubs & their affiliates. Unmistakably Renate. Reichs estimate motorcycles are all druggies or murderers. Not a good one in the bunch. Throw in Kit, her very corny nephew and you have the makings for a not so good innovate.The story seems not to be able to stay focused. It begins to wander out of control. There are sub-stories to be had which deter the main story even further. The the novel just is not focused at all. 2/3 of the way through, I found I just didn't care how this thing turned out. Please, send Kit back to Texas, stay away from bikers & their clubs, focus on your profession & give us readers a gentle break$LABEL$0,1,1
I've seen all this before..... This movie is a reckoning of everything you've ever seen before.Avatar=Alien (with Sig. Weaver)+Star Wars 1(with blue but less annoying race of Jar Jar Binks)+Harry Potter(flying dragons)+Disney movies (over saturated color and animation)+Top Gun (what's with the US Marine's schtick in all these invade-um movies anyway?)Okay Mr. Cameron, I see that you are getting really good with computer animation....I get it (hence the additional star in the rating).The problem is that I sat there fore 2 hours, THINKING that I was watching computer animation.I'm off to see the Hurt Locker now....atleast there will be a decent story.$LABEL$0,1,1
Overwhelming basic primer for an AA. This little textbook is so favourable to old and new AA's in aiuto get over those old urges, low self-esteem and more. Some of the material is not covered any where else and is a really good book to use at half-way houses because it allows people to speak their feelings about what is going on with them via the topics covered in the book. From weeks to months, as people get sober, the subjects in this book allow them to express their progress and to begin to understand the journey that they are on in a very positive way.$LABEL$1,1,0

Gossip of the Worse Kind. The writer says at the beginning that Bob refused to talk to him for this pounds so instead he seeks out ex-girlfriends, fired band members, relatives of those Bob supposedly done wrong (e.g. Phil Ochs) and records their mostly negative observations about Bob. Although you did to read a lot of rumors and Bob bashing along with a rehash of what has been printed in other biographies.....this Bob's for you!$LABEL$0,1,1
