Rabbit Proof Fence. RABBIT PROOF FENCEThe movie was GREAT!! It was suspenseful. You never knew what was going to happen next.The 3 aborigine girls were always being followed by the tracker. They were also helped alot by people that you never would of thought. For example a white farmlady gave them food and coats.A white man helped them navigate which made the movie more exciting.I like this movie. I think people should watch it. I also think it is bad taking kids from their families this is why they called the thousands of Aborigine children taken away "The Stolen Generation.BY: ParisBordeaux5/14/04$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disk was so scratched that we couldnt watch the movie. We love the movie Ratatouille. We were sad when we noticed that the DVD was missing from our collection of movies so we decided to look at Amazon to get a copy. We looked at the used copies because the new ones are still @ $20. So we looked at the used ones. We found on that said Condition: Used - Good for $6.86. We ordered it. It came in when expected and with much anticipation we opened it so we could watch it that night, only to see an incredible amount of scratches on the disk. I was shocked. I could accept a couple, but it looked like it was on the floor of a car in the back seat for 6 months. We tried to watch it any way and got through 30 minutes with only a few pixelated moments and a couple stutters. Then it happened. It started stalling for 3 seconds, then 5 seconds then it froze. As far as rating the movie itself, I give it a 5 star! but the quality... I have ordered a lot from Amazon, I am very disappointing.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Beauty Comes From Within. I just bought this high priced fancy looking toaster. Are you kidding me? I figured it was just a fluke that this toaster toasted unevenly/ burned one side while leaving the other side untouched. Sad to read that everyone that has purchased this toaster has the same issue. The question is - Why would a company with a great reputation like Cuisinart sell a toaster that doesn't even work? Apparently they don't think it is necessary to test the product./If you are considering this due to the beauty of it - Forget it! Beauty comes from within.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Self aggrandizing. If there is a Donald Trump in the nanny business Ms. Kline would surely be hosting the next Apprentice show except that she does not seem to have the same gravitaz that Mr. Trump demonstrates. Name-dropping and full bragging of how important she is to the "over achieving" parents who are basically folks trying to integrate work and family lifestyles does not make Ms. Kline a likeable decent person. (Whether you agree with how the parents are spending their time or not)Instead of being empathetic, Ms. Kline comes across as a self-ordained I-am-a-very-important person in Washington. She brags about the fact she can choose you as a client and gets more important clients than she really cares for.The book is a quick easy read, but there is no substance and a lot of snide remarks on Ms. Kline's clients make her a character that any parent should stay away from.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Don't waste your $. I bought this player ($160 at my local Costco) for my husband for Father's Day. We spent many hours trying to get the software to work, and I never did get songs transfered to the player. Also I couldn't find a way to delete files from the player (it comes preloaded with some music--most of which was not our taste).

To Kill a Fruit Fly. 02/08/10Dear shoppers:My cats recently picked up fleas from their vet. For over twenty years of cat ownership we never had a problem with fleas, as we exercise a very strict protocol on contamination controlls.It was with an extended vet hospital stay that my cat brought home "unwanted guests" FLEAS!!!The vet recommended [...] and flea traps to augment their demise. Simply stated the VICTOR FLEA TRAPS do not work!!! The best they do is to trap harmless fruit flies and some gnats.I still have a flea problem as I was lulled into thinking that my home was flea free by the fact that I did not trap any fleas and my cat had only pickedup a few fleas (My vet stated).Well the traps are useless!!! Scientifically I do not know why I did not realize that, I panicked to be free of the problem.Save your money and just use a vet approved topical flea med on your pets.Sincerely:MOLARMAMA$LABEL$0,0,-100

Surreal and exceptional. I wasn't sure what to expect before watching this, but by the end of the film I was stunned by how well it had been assembled and presented. The distinct lack of narration and guidance allow Andre and Calvin to lead the viewer through the communally warped and surreal psyche of a pair of ruthless and motivated teenage killers. Not since the original Blair Witch Project have I seen a film that has been successful in maintaining the illusion of being amateur film re-assembled by professionals, and this one being based on a tragic string of events that we're all aware of is particularly haunting and surreal. The two young actors do an exceptional job and are very believable. Scenes are wonderfully assembled in mounting tension and the film reaches a tremendous crescendo through which I could hardly blink. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The Island of Dr Moreau soundtrack is truly a masterpiece.. The music focuses on the humanity of the beast people in the movie. Gary Chang is a genius. Through his work the emotions are more clear cut in the music than in the movie. Even people who don't watch The Island of Dr Moreau will appreciate this rare chance to feel the music in their bones.

obviously written by 2 people.... Two books in one! You're reading one story - and toward the end someone else takes over and writes an ending for something that makes no sense based on the original plot. Obviously James Patterson got to a point and couldn't finish - and left someone else to tie it all up. Unfortunately the way it was "tied up" was so lame I'll never waste my time on another of his books.I don't expect literary value from a read like this - I just thoroughly enjoy the escape.

Great comedians but not a great story or script. I've seen these four in movies and TV shows that have made me laugh till it hurt. Shockingly I did not laugh once at this film. I can't blame the cast because if you see Tropic Thunder, 21 Jump street, The I.T. Crowd Wedding Crashers and then this film you will know what I'm talking about. "Spoiler" It is yet another story where aliens come to earth and they are evil monkeys. I wish they did it like 21 Jump Street and made the threat be distracted by the incompetent heroes and then busted. Also the aliens were ridiculous. I feel like someone or some people did not use the talent that was in this film for some odd reason.

Bad versions of good songs.... TSIA. This album contains some of Phish's finest songs in their career. Such wonderful tunes as "REBA" and "squirming coil" which are a delight to hear live are here rendered as lifeless, unfocused, energyless rot. Now I have a feeling that I may get some flack for this someday but can anyone who has heard any of these songs live truly say that the studio tracks come even close? PHISH's first two albums are dull, musaky, and low-energy, partially because they hadn't figred out how to use a studio yet, they just tried to recreate their live performance. If only they had learned what they learned by "billy breathes" and applied it to the songs on this album, the album woudl be outstanding, but the result here is almost unlistenable.

TALES FOR A JEWISH INDIAN. One of the strangest nuances of this book is Ed Eagle, who everyone seems to think is a Native American, but as we learn later, he is really a Jew and was accepted as an Indian because of his basketball prowess. Okay, Mr. Woods, that's original. Too bad the rest of the novel isn't quite so fresh; but indeed SANTA FE RULES manages to weave an involving, if somewhat hard to believe tale.Anyone who's read a great deal of mystery novels will see the truth in this novel very early on. Woods does manage to throw in a neat twist at the end, but it only enhances what an astute reader will have already figured out.Woods writes like a screenwriter; much of his narrative would transfer well to the big screen. A little faster pacing would have enhanced the book as well. But if you're in the mood for a superflous but highly entertaining read, SANTA FE RULES delivers.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Yes Veronica, there is a good guitar record this year.. Dweezil Zappa's "Automatic" is stunning not only for its diversity and musicianship, but also for being able to surprise you again and again as you get more familiar with it. Many of the songs seem to open up after a few listens and there's some wonderful guitar playing here. Dweezil's brother Ahmet, who is underrated and a terribly good vocalist, sings on "You're a Mean One Mister Grinch", and Lisa Loeb makes an appearance as a secretary in "Dick Cinnamon's Office." Blues Saraceno, Mike Keneally and others play on the record also. Coming out on Steve Vai's record label Favored Nations, it's no surprise that it's a brilliant record from a guitar point of view, and you won't tire of it quickly. Highly recommended. This is Dweezil's best record yet, possibly typing with Z's "Shampoohorn"!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Lose 30 Pounds in 30 days; Weight loss secrets they don't want you to know about. I loved this CD. I listened to it twice and took notes.

Rollicking analysis of an S&L's collapse. James Shea adopts a twangy vernacular to skewer the inflation and deflation of Don Dixon's Texas savings and loan. Dixon took advantage of deregulation and profited handsomely. Whether it was intentional fraud or opportunism is up to the reader to decide, but the book is written like a summer detective novel. It's better than so much of the hack work out there, and it's true! I recommend this in addition to "Funny Money" by Mark Singer.$LABEL$1,0,-100
May make you very itchy!. If you have sensitive skin, this detergent could make you very itchy. I normally use Free and Clear All. My wife brought this home a few days ago. The first load of my clothes I did in it lit my skin up - no visible rashes really, just made my skin burn a bit and feel like bugs crawling all over me, especially in my facial hair and scalp where I touch with my hands.Beware of this if you have or if others in your house have sensitive skin. Residue can stay behind in the washer/dryer and it will affect others if they have sensitive skin even if they use a different detergent.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Just Can't Cut It !. I was drawn to this book title because I have been collecting some wonderful fabrics that have large designs and I have seen some beautiful quilts displayed in my local quilt shop that made use of these large patterned fabrics.

Not an accurate representation of the Leo Frank trial. There were some issues getting this DVD to work properly that I never experienced before with other DVDs. I have heard others say there were some possible defects with it missing portions of the miniseries and so forth. I was finally able to get it to work and what I saw was appalling. This miniseries makes a grotesque mockery of history and what really happened at the Leo Frank trial. Dozens of people did not stand up in the middle of the trial and start singing with the result of the trial coming to a screeching halt. This miniseries about the Leo Frank case is one of the most racist, prejudiced, dishonest, slanderous and defamatory treatments against Southerners ever produced.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Agenda science. Sociologists are normally very meticulous about how they design and conduct surveys and interviews. I found the questions the author posed to be unclear and subject to criticism, or to alternative interpretation. The individual quotations from adults who experienced divorce as a child have a complex underpinning that deserves further analysis: I suspect that many of these respondents are synthesizing an experience, sort of "making the best of a bad history." In any case, I don't think this book does more than try to substantiate further the theory of good divorce by interpreting grown children's responses to the best advantage of that theory. Not convincing.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A tiny, useless piece of junk for everything but toast. The oven part of this thing is so small that you can barely fit in anything worth heating up. If you don't use the tray and try to heat up a hot dog, say, be careful, because odds are the hotdog will roll of the back of the wire rack (which has nothing in its rear to stop things from falling off) and into the very bottom of the machine, where it will be an enormous pain to get out again.It toasts fine.

this book is not for the average person. This book was assigned to me as a reading for a book review in my cultural anthropology class at Mississippi State University. I thought that this book was a difficult one to read because the layout was hard to follow. The names began to get jumbled by the fourth chapter. The story line could be good if it was brought to the audience in a more typical and easy to read format. Less rambling on and on would be great.

A outstanding wireless controller. The Wavebird is, by far, the best wireless countroller out there. With 16(yes, 16) different channels, you can be sure that there won't be any outside interference. In addition, the Wavebird has a claimed 20 feet range, but mine can go well over 40. Dispite all this, the Wavebird still has an ample 100 hours of battery life. Being a casual gamer, My Wavebird has lasted me from September to mid-March and still going on strong. For those who complain about the lack of rumble, know this: vibrations require a motor which sucks up battery power like nobody's business. So unless you want it to have a 20 minute battery life, quit your yapping.Recommended at the highest level.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Doesn't work with all table tops.. We can't use this at our table!! Our table has a support that runs along close to the edges that drops the clearance by about 3 inches. This is not a problem when you are sitting on a chair but when you use the booster seat there is only an inch or two for our son's legs to fit through and it will not work. I guess this would be a problem with any booster seat but still - it would have been nice to know. So the booster seat we bought is sitting in the living room right now and getting no use whatsoever. We can use it at our outdoor table which has a tabletop that extends out past all the supports but at this point our 20 month old would rather sit on a regular chair even if his shoulders barely clear the table.

iTalk = Handy VOICE Recorder. The iTalk recorder makes very adequate voice recordings on my 3G 40 Gig iPod. I've had no problems with freezing (or any performance issues). Before using iTalk, I read all of the reviews, and following the helpful suggestions from other users, I've had good recordings from the first.What's terrific about iTalk is that you can organize your recordings in iTunes. As another user mentioned, you can create playlists of related recordings that can later be burned to CD-Rom.Two drawbacks for me are the volume level of iTalk's speaker, which I find too low for adequate playback even at top volume on my iPod, and the lack of a carrying case to protect and identify the iTalk in my purse.Would I buy again? Absolutely. Would I recommend? Without reservation.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Compact Disc Player/Recorder. I've only had this item for about a week, but it has performed very satisfactorily during that time. My suggestion for improvement would be that the remote should be able to turn the player/recorder on and off. Also, I have other Sony products and this item is similar in that it's operation is far more complex than similar items made by other companies. I think that is because Sony consistently tries to include every concieveable function in their products. However, after reading the manual several times, I think I've learned the system.

The Corrections. ...P>At first, I laughed a lot and thought the book was funny, entertaining and well-written. However, after about 200 pages, I became a little confused and a lot bored. What is the greatness this book manifests, I wondered. The writing ceased to be entertaining. The characters began to seem extremely foolish and unbelievable to me. The peculiar juxtaposition of dates and time seemed arbitrary and unnecessary.I still don't understand why so many publications whose reviewers I usually respect think this is such a great piece of writing. In reality, I think a great hoax has just been perpetrated on us poor unsuspecting readers. I DID read to the end but I'm not recommending this book to any of my reader friends.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Good for a religious book.

Misleading picture. Okay, the product itself is good. HOWEVER, the picture is completely misleading. The picture shows a plastic bag with the white pads that are almost as big as the bag...

The cheap metal blade comes sharp and the shipping is extremely fast but the blade bends and breaks with normal wear and tear. It's cheap metal. As far a throwing it is concerned... Don't even bother. I broke 2 of them in less than an hour. The handles are cheaply made and break easily. I've had plastic forks that were more durable.

Superb addition to your Rozz/Christian Death catalog.. The recording is from Rozz's tour of Europe in support of Daucus Karota, and features several recordings that unfortunately Rozz never took into the studio for a potential commercial release. Rozz is emotive and powerful throughout the performance, so it is definately a worthy addition for any fan. The music is more rock-oriented than dark and melancholy. The sound quality slightly pales in comparison to the Triple X Records release, "Iconologia", and the deletion of the Christian Death songs performed during this show is a disappointment. The aforementioned as of yet unreleased tracks more than make-up for the glaring omissions in the recording, so I definately recommend picking this one up!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Nice Surprise. I really didn't know what to expect when I started to watch "Book of Lore" but I was pleasantly surprised. Director Chris LaMartina pulls out all of the stops with this intriguing tale of horror that unfolds just like a Stephen King novel. A cast of unknowns turn in credible performances and even though it is low budget, it takes a hold of you and doesn't let go. It was nearly two hours long but it deserved its length. Character and plot development was essential in making it work. If you're a horror buff, don't miss this. The twists and turns are top notch and the collage of music and sound effects are weaved in very nicely. 4 stars. I haven't watched the second feature (Grave Mistake) yet.

Not for all day wear. I (like many others) use the radios when riding my snowboard.The sound quality can't be faulted, both sending and receiving are crystal clear (and now private). Wearing it all day you can now hear when people are paging you, not just when standing in line.Now the bad; the build quality should be questioned, the speaker inside the earbod rattles around in mine, and the "PTT" button is difficult to press when wearing gloves. The earbud's a little big for my ear, and isn't as comfortable as it could be (although it fits under my helmet fine).The other problem I've had with this is that it pops out of the headphone jack on the radio with annoying regularity. I've solved this with duct tape, which isn't pretty but it is functional....$LABEL$0,0,-100
Overrated. The entire book could have been distilled down to one or two useful pages. A typical example of the author's predilection to stating the obvious in expert-speak: "Generally children will send discernible non-verbal signals when they are ready to end a conversation with an adult. They often begin to stare off into space or become silly. It is time to end the exchange."And then there are the self-promoting anecdotes such as, "It is encouraging to meet alumni from the 90's who had been exposed to intense social skill instruction during their high school years. Their conversational entrees are far more appropriate and effective: 'How are Mrs. Lavoie, Christian, Danny and Meggi?' 'How long will you be in the area?' 'How are things on Cape Cod?'"If you can bring yourself to wade through the superfluous chit chat and you've never read anything on this subject before, it may be worth buying used.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A classic performance. I have owned and enjoyed the VHS format of this performance for several years. I gladly would have replaced it with the DVD, but I understand there are no subtitles. That is truly inexcusable since they are there in the VHS. Nevertheless, the performance is grand in every sense of the word. The death scene as done by Nesterenko is absolutely breathtaking. I actually prefer the Mussorgsky version (Kirov/Gergiev) for many reasons, but I am still very happy to own this one.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Typical Washington. The book starts out OK--and some of the concepts are impressive considering it was written in a pre 9/11 world.

Carter deminished. Carter's book brings to mind of how can you trust his judgement? During his presidency, he sent some brave men on a suicide mission to rescue the hostages. The equipment they were given was not designed to be used over a desert climate. Some of the men paid with their lives, but Carter lives on. If these men had reached Tehran, what were they going to do, knock on doors? I get the impression that his innocent smile is lethal.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Softer then expected, but still good.. Significant Other was good, but I expected it to be better. Three Dollar Bill (The first album), was a hard hitting album that rocked all the way through. This one still rocks, but it seems like it gets softer in the middle of the songs, especially during the chorus. However Significant Other is a much deeper and much better written album then the first. Excellent tracks on this CD are "Just Like This", "N 2 Gether Now", "Show Me What You Got", "No Sex", and of course the smash hit, "Nookie".$LABEL$1,0,-100
Terribly converted e-book format. I couldn't get past the first 5 chapters in this book due to the number of typos and poor translation. As soon as I'd begin to be immersed in the story a string of typos would trip me up and frustrate me. Often times I'd find myself re-reading a paragraph more than once to try and figure out what was being said because of the bad translation. This is certainly not a Wordsworth e-book conversion!

A Must Have For Your Property With Large Trees. I enjoy gardening and try to do everything myself. I have a Acre of land with alot of mature trees and was never able to prune the lower 15-20 feet.

Fun disco music. Music can be serious, but it doesn't have to be serious all the time. Baccara, with their European accents, their sexy voices and their lightweight songs, made disco music that was never meant to be taken seriously. Their music was pure fun, and never meant to be anything else. If anybody doubted that, listen to their cover of Yummy yummy yummy. It was a silly song when first recorded by the Ohio Express in the sixties and sounds every bit as silly by Baccara, but it suits them.Baccara topped the British charts in the late seventies with Yes sir I can boogie. The follow-up, Sorry I'm a lady, provided them with a top ten hit. These are the best tracks here, though The devil sent you to Laredo, Parles-vous Francais and their covers of La bamba and Can't help falling in love are also wonderful.Baccara did not make music that could be called essential, but they had a style all their own that provides a refreshing change from more serious music.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointed. I doubt if I will use this product very much. I ordered this money clip/credit card clip with the thought that it would eliminate the need to carry a wallet on certain occasions. I was very disappointed with this product.First of all, the clip is bulky and the corners of the watch are sharp. When I reach into my pocket to get the clip out, I stab my fingers with the corners of the watch.

Good ride. I just purchased a Revmaster to spin at home and looked at all the DVD's out there to use, and chose this one and another one. I am so glad I did.

Mindy is very precise in her explanation of what she is doing and offers you choices. Very knowledgeable instructor.

Waste of $20 - get the Krups. My Braun died after a few years of good service. I went with Mr Coffee, but will get a Krups after just a couple of weeks. Not worth the effort to return it so I will eat the $20. This is why I dislike it: the green leds do not shutoff, you have to unplug it; after you grind the coffee and try to empty it, a lot is left stuck on the bottom; the 'grind' button sometimes sticks, and you think it is broken; it is taller than my old Braun and is somewhat unwieldy.

The worst movie I've ever seen. I think that it was obvious by the trailers alone that this was going to be a horrible movie anyway, and that's why I didn't bother going to the theaters to see it like most of my friends. I waited until it was on HBO, and I have to say that it was the most painful 80 minutes I've ever spent in front of a television screen. The entire cast is absolutely horrible, once again proving that as long as you have a pretty face you don't need to have a teaspoon's worth of talent to be in the movies. The movie follows the "She's All That" format pretty closely, and every time it tries to go into another movie it only confuses the viewer more. My advice? Go to the dentist and ask to have four of your teeth drilled at once. Even that is better than sitting through this pile of garbage.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Brilliant. All the favorable reviews here below say it all, so I'll just comment on the language McCarthy uses. The author's apparent flouting of the normal rules of grammar in favor of stark, harrowing rhythm works beautifully.

How to read this book. I would just like to respond to Flavio's review. As a physicist, I drew the same kinds of mathematical conclusions he did when he read the book. I do not, however, feel that this is the point. Whether 9 comes out in the decimal system or 7 comes out in the octal system is irrelevant. "No 9" remains a beautifully written piece of literature that expresses author's fascination with numbers and geometry. Sure, you can find rigourous mathematical proofs why '9' must come out. I have worked it out myself, and I don't disagree. However, there are many scientific phenomena (rainbows, fractals etc.) that are no less beautiful despite being taken apart, analysed, and understood.Number 9 is a captivating, well written and beautiful book that was a pleasure to read. The reader is drawn in by the author's fascination with the subject, and kept there by the author's storytelling skill.I recommend it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
ankle brace. This brace has inflated pads to make it more comfortable. Unfortunately, they are glued to the hard plastic sides with a flexible adhesive, so they shift after you apply them. This can result in an uncomfortable fit. After I taped the pads in place with adhesive tape, the braces worked better and were more comfortable. I had a hard time applying this brace by myself because I also had a fractured clavicle--think I would have had trouble with any brace. When my wife helped me apply it, it was tight enough and provided good support.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Worth the wait. Possibly the most comprehensive Phish album to date. While it lacks some of the improvisational flare of Lawn Boy and Junta, it ranks right up there in my book.

Car Seat Base Does NOT Work. The design of the car seat base is very defective. There is no possible way to get it tight enough. I could pull on the front of the base with one finger and flip it right out of the LATCH belt (that was pulled as tight as humanly possible). In addition, the car seat carrier was difficult to secure on the base and difficult to get off, losening the belt even further with each attempt. I returned it for the Graco Oakwood and could not believe how complicated and unsafe this Eddie Bauer Travel System is in comparison. Two thumbs way down!!!$LABEL$0,0,-100

My personal album of the year.. Scarling is the first band to come out in the past few years that I've had any interest in at all. Most (not all, but most) of the stuff I listen to is ten, fifteen years older or more. Yet they've put out two amazing albums in a relatively short period of time that left a lasting impression on me. So Long, Scarecrow is a particularly emotional piece of work, the first full length album I've heard this year that made me feel something more than ambivalence (needless to say, I've been disappointed by some of the recent works of some of my all-time favorite artists). This heralds a complete departure from Jessicka's Jack Off Jill roots, where remnants of them could still be heard and felt in Sweet Heart Dealer. I would definetly say that this album has bumped Scarling up to my new favorite band.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The tape doesn't follow the book. After reading through the book, then listening to the tape I found myself very confused. The tape starts out following the layout of the book, but quickly starts moving around to different sections (some even on other pages) and then returning without any warning. I had to have a native speaker assist me in figuring out where the tape was reading from, and make marks in the book. I also felt this went to fast, and didn't cover basics such as syntax. This book also jumps into full dialogue much too fast, and doesn't give proper instruction. This is my first attempt at learning Vietnamese, and if I didn't have a native speaker to help me I would probably give up after trying this book.$LABEL$0,0,-100

My thoughts on "A Twist of Fate". With the metric tons of garbage released under the guise of rock, it's a crime that John Arch doesn't release more brilliant material like this to counteract it. I guess we should just be thankful that we have this 2-song EP at all, but it leaves you wanting more of Arch's amazing vocals. The winner on this EP is Relentless, one of the best progressive rock songs these ears have heard in quite some time. Between Jim Matheos on guitar here and Ray Alder in Redemption'sSnowfall on Judgement Day, it's both a shame and a blessing that Fates Warning had to break up to give us great music elsewhere.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The Greatest Country-Rock Album Ever. The Gram Parsons-led Byrds was a much different outfit than the original group, which is still my favorite incarnation of the Byrds. However (with a boldfaced, 32-point capital "H"), this album is quite simply fantastic in its own right. It is quite simply the best country-rock album ever made, in my opinion, and that is saying a lot. From the opening strains of Dylan's "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere," you know you're in for a great treat.

Ayurveda Dumbed Down. I purchased this book on the strength of other consumer's reviews, but was disappointed by how simplistic it is. Ayurvedic medicine is a life-long study, not a "handbook" for looking up routine symptoms. It may be an introduction to this ancient form of healing, but the book really can't help anyone get an over-all picture of their state of health, or give good advice on how to treat yourself. This book is just an example of the Western approach: why see a real, trained practitioner when you can save money and fix yourself? Only you can't--at least not with this book.

A nice and brief social commentary. I'm a big fan of other Sicilian novels, especially Lampedusa's the Leopard and Riotta's Prince of the Clouds. The island's tragic history produces a rich backdrop for painting a nuanced set of characters and emotions.Sciascia's short novel is wholly Sicilian, centering around his anti-mafia frustrations. The characters are nicely sketched and the writing is brief and exciting. It's a short book that reads quickly and lively.I appreciated the story and its quick moving plot. It's a good book and the introduction is helpful for understanding it's context. At the end of the day, the work is more commentary on Sciascia's times than it is a complex wrought novel. I'm glad I read it, but I didn't find it as fulfilling as I thought I might. Look to the Leopard or the Prince of Clouds if you're looking for a full fledged novel. Otherwise, you'll be very pleased with this nice work.$LABEL$1,0,-100

young Immature male humor. I expected this film to have some raw moments after seeing the cast, but after 30min I knew that my entire experience was going to be redundant sexual humor that never seemed to take a break even long enough to develop any sense of a story.

Cheapo Alarm Clock!. This alarm clock had all of the features that I needed: large LCD, auto-set, dual alarms. However, the build quality and instruction manual are terrible.First, to turn off the alarm, there is a small "Off" button the far right of the top. However, half of the time, the alarm treats this as a snooze, so 10 minutes later, the alarm goes off again. This is really annoying if you actually get up when the alarm goes off and aren't just hitting the snooze button.Second, the alarm has a nap function that will make the alarm go off in 15, 30, or etc. minutes. In order to turn off the nap function after you have set it (say you set it for 30 minutes, but you woke up after 20), the manual says to hold down the off or hold down the nap button. But this doesn't work.All in all, I won't ever buy an RCA clock again.$LABEL$0,0,-100

However, first it dismayed, then depressed, then just made me plain angry that Ms. Quindlen could be so superficial, so full of cliches, have such shallow skills of description and so absolutely little insight into either London or literature. Surely someone soon will pick up the inky scratches and try again.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great sound, but be gentle with the wires!. I've used these for 3 years of daily train commuting, and they isolate the outside sound fairly well. My only major complaint is that, despite carefully winding them in the supplied case each day, the wires eventually frayed near the earbuds. I had the same issue with earlier Sony earbuds, and I thought the thicker gauge wires of the Shure would help.On the plus side, Shure honored the 2-year warranty and promptly sent me a brand-new replacement. But now, barely a year later, the cord is fraying again on both sides, the signal is dropping out, and I've finally decided to order a pair ofEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones (Black), since I've had a lot of success with their musician's earplugs. Their wires look delicate too, so I think I'll pre-emptively wrap them with some electrical tape near the bud end, a precaution that might be advised with these Shure models as well.Bottom line, I loved the e2cs, but it's time to move on. YMMV...$LABEL$1,0,-100

Comfortable, Affordable, and Easy to Use BT Headset. I use this headset with a V3 Razr and have been very pleased with the performance. I've worn the headset for an hour at times and it's not a problem having it on. The sound quality is very good although there is some ocassional static on my end. This is my first BT headset, so I think the static is probably a consequence of the BT connection rather than the headset itself. The people I have called tell me that the headset actually sounds better than talking into my old Motorola V265 phone. Overall, the headset fits well, is easy to set up and use, and provides very good sound quality. For the price, this headset is a good value that's going to be hard to beat. I would definitely recommend it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Please read this if you're an Xbox 360 user. This drive is terribly unreliable. It failed the initial test to begin using it as Xbox 360 storage (which should have been my first clue) but eventually was accepted by the Xbox and I started six hours worth of Battlefield DLC downloading. Halfway through, the USB drive lost data and had to be reinitialized by the Xbox (which should have been my second clue) so I started the downloads again. Worked okay, then after the console shut down and started back up the USB drive had to be reinitialized by the Xbox. Now this drive is in the trash, where it belongs. Too bad, it's a nice looking USB drive and the price was great for the capacity -- but it's just no good.$LABEL$0,0,-100
The Laserdisc is so much better, since it has the whole show. My long time waiting for a DVD version of that old but great Laserdisc was wasted. It's absolutely depressing what they did here, by cutting some of the best parts of the original show.The Queen Medley by the great band Extreme was probably the best part of this show, not only because the way they played, but also because the playlist choice. A Medley of Bohemian Rhapsody, Bycicle Race, Another One Bites Dust, Keep Yourselves Alive, and others leading to one of the most beautiful moments of the show: the Radio Ga Ga ending, leading the audience to tears.Although the sound has been improved and a new and useless "extra materials" has been added, it doesn't worth the content they cut (opening act, Metallica, Def Leppard, GnR, Extreme and others).I would never exchange the old original laserdisc for this useles "extra materials" with a bunch of new footage.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A Study of Six Statesmen. I enjoyed this book immensely. Each of the six contributed differently. George Kennan, a foreign service officer and then scholar, was the most cerebral and prescient. Dean Acheson was the most arrogant. Robert Lovett had the best sense of humor which served him well in dealing with Congress and others endowed with super egos. Averell Harriman was the wealthiest and the most tenacious. John McCloy was the most accomplished. Charles (Chip) Bohlen was a foreign service officer with distinguished longevity.These individuals were great statesmen. Except for Kennan, at first they were all in favor of US involvement in the Vietnam War. Even very accomplished statesmen misgauged Vietnam.I highly recommend this book despite its length. It is one of my favorite books.$LABEL$1,0,-100

My First and Last Elizabeth Berg Novel - Read Why. This novel confused me. (I would give it 1-1/2 stars if possible.) The subject matter is decidedly adult (divorce affairs, near affairs), but the writing seems more appropriate for someone in the age range of maybe an 11 to 14 year old girl. In fact, I even looked it up to see if I accidentally selected a book meant for young readers. Both the husband and the wife are so incredibly childish acting, the story seemed infantile and unrealistic. All the scenes with the husband playing a shopping mall Santa were unnecessary and, frankly, rather stupid. I love quirky characters, but these characters were just kind of foolish. The only person halfway plausible and interesting was the young daughter. After this taste of Berg's writing, I will not sample another.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Good Read. Being a Demonologist and working with "possessed" or claimed to be. I find this book well writen and investigating demonic cases are not an easy task to deal with. It is rare that a person will in fact become "possessed" by demons, but in my own work I have found that in a lot of cases it is in fact some form of mental illness with the person and not a demonic attack. In any case this book does make for a good read anyways.Katie BoydAuthor of Devils & Demonology In the 21st Century$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good for an old diamond!. King Diamond does a great job here, which remembers those days of "Them", "The Eye", "Abigail" and "Conspiracy". However, the aforementioned albums are better than this one. Are the King's resources exhausted? Not at all, but this album, while very good, shows how hard is to keep writing original music after many years of innovation. Simply, there is nothing new to say in spite of this marvelous horror tale, the powerful sound, the great production and the very professional musicianship of the band (particularly Andy LaRocque sounds great here, not mentioning Diamond's vocals and the superb rhythmic baseline). In few words, a very solid work from one of the few classic bands that still are sailing over there with honor. You won't be disappointed: a great and soulful return to the roots, without hiding how many years we already have on our backs. Great job, evil creature!$LABEL$1,0,-100
"Surprises" were too obvious, Character uninteresting. I downloaded this book for MS Reader without knowing anything about the author. Although the premise of the book seemed somewhat intriguing at first, I got tired of the author trying to "surprise" me with events that were so obvious that a kid would have seen them coming. With few exceptions, the characters were not given enough "character" to make them interesting in the least. I can't believe that this is supposed to be a best-selling author. I suppose on some levels this book could be interesting (such as the descriptions of Miami), but for me it was plain boredom.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Get what you pay for. I would suggest spending a few more bucks for better quality earphones. First and foremost, these do not fit very comfortably in the ear and do not come with multiple ear buds.

The comedy does not mix with the drama.

Very general video - Doesn't cover all the questions. I was disappointed in this video because it didn't cover a lot of the questions I have about soldering - how to keep my tip clean (use of sponge, use of a sal ammonic block), how to tin my tip, etc. Instead, Payne just covers the act of soldering. She also moves very quickly and doesn't always explain what she means, which makes it a little confusing. I was looking for a a video course in copper-foil soldering and this did not really explain to me how to correct the issues I'm having with my own soldering.

Trouble in paradise for Toni & Alex. Their May/ July (not really December) affair is in trouble due to another woman putting the moves on Alex without him really reciprocating. Meanwhile, Col.

A Journey Back Home. Garrison Keillor delivers yet another home run with his trip down memory lane to fictional Lake Wobegon. Chock full of boyhood angst, baseball, religion, flatulence jokes and sexual fixation, Keillor elicits memories from his flock of loyal readers and creates a pseudo-memoir that stirs echoes of Bill Bryson's Life & Times of the Thunderbolt Kid and David James Duncan's The Brothers K. High praise for this author and much deserved. If you're a man (especially one who grew up pecking away at his own Underwood) between the ages of 30 and 60, Lake Wobegon Summer 1956 is a 'must read'.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!. It's a shame that more people out there cannot be graced by the musical presence of Amel Larrieux just because she is not on the top ten lists nor make appearances on MTV. Nevertheless, she is a gem, soulfully bombarding her listener with a concordance of musical honesty. Her voice is airy in its delivery, she literally breathes into every song. Talent such as hers makes me upset that artists such as Britney Spears can be idolized, yet REAL voice talent such as Ms. Larrieux's can be ignored. This is one of the best albums of 2004. Highly recommended if you are a fan of the likes of India Arie., Jill Scott or Sade.$LABEL$1,0,-100

It's like listening to a tv evangelist. I read this book BEFORE 'The Bible Code'and it made me want to read the original.This is the only book I ever threw in the garbage the second I read the last word. I don't need to be preached to at my age. This guy is just another big mouth preaching about God and the bible. All Stanton knows how to say is 'they left out the vowels'-give me a break. I will be reading The Bible Code soon. It may be another Chariot of the Gods but I bet it won't preach to me. Save your money.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Best tasting lo-cal cat treat!. We have a cat on steroids due to a medical condition. We have to count every calorie for her. Her diet is very limited, so treats are important to her. We've spent a fortune trying every lo-cal treat. Either cats don't like them, or they're not really lo-cal enough.A trim Treat is 0.8 calories ... break 4 of them in 1/2 & your cat gets 8 little treats for ~ 3 calories. (Roughly the same a 1 piece of other lo-cal treats.)We have 4 cats. 3 out of 4 love Trim Treats. Even those that are not on diets. (Except Jessicat ... she hates everything that is not filet mignon or shrimp. She's the "Mikey" of the cat world)Trim Treats are a great find. My cats highly recommend them!$LABEL$1,0,-100

It's Only Missing God. God is almost completely absent from this film, which, you'll have to admit is pretty weird. There were also two or three really uncomfortable sex scenes. No nudity, but still painfully uncomfortable to watch with the family. One especially where her husband threw her on the bed then pushed her head aside and said "Don't look at me."The acting, writing, directing were Ok, but when you see a christian film, you hope to see something that focuses on God.Definately recommend you skip this one.$LABEL$0,0,-100

oh no, what's happened to him?. When I started reading Allan Folsom's THE EXILE, I couldn't put it down...when I did (after reading it in two marathon sessions) I ran out and purchased (not at Amazon but at full retail price) THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and THE CONFESSION.I was amazed by his intricate plotting, the continued surprise twists, the breakneck pacing. Here was an author who was a clear master of the genre - imaginative, facile, talented.Sadly, The Machiavelli Covenant was disappointing. I kept waiting for it to take off, and it never did. I was 200 pages into it and I asked myself "When is this going to start" It was interesting, but didn't generate the excitment his other books did.I will definately read his next book when it comes out, I'm just not salivating for its pub date.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Nothing like Hair One or Wen. I bought this because the bottle said it was a "conditioning shampoo". This is nothing like Hair One or Wen.

Too long, too little, nothing new. It is very disappointing to write a poor review on a Clancy novel. One of my favorite authors. The good is that you get to renew all the characters of the previous books that have not been killed off and you enjoy. The story line is disappointing in that it is almost a rehash of the last books with different villians. The most disappointing is even though the book is 1000 pages none of the characters has enough of a central theme to identify with unless they are old friends from previous readings. There were pages upon pages of preaching on all kinds of issues somewhat akind to Ann Rand (Atlas Shrugged). Hope he can find the forumula if there is a next book.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A Superior Work and Recording. If you enjoy baroque music, this is certainly a must. The clarity of this recording is wonderful. It has a kind of depth that I don't often find in CD recordings - almost as if I can reach out and take hold of the music.

didn't send/didn't return calls/still charged for it. I don't know why they didn't send me the Toddy (that I'd heard so much good about), but they didn't and they didn't return calls and they still charged me for it. When I would call the cust. serv, who never knew what the hell was going on, she'd say, "I see the order. I don't know why you didn't get it. I'll have someone call you about it." They never called.It was July of last year and I was a month away from getting married, so I didn't follow up like I usually would, but I figured eventually it would show up or they'd credit my card.

Just not enough. This soundtrack is like a five course meal stuck at the third course. The music in this film is really what brought it together and was what for me personally put this movie into the good category as opposed to the ok one. There were much more songs that should, could have been on the cd but weren't. Underworld and Thievery Corporation to just name a few were left off the list, even though the songs were very important to the feel of the movie.

1st time review. After reading all the negative reviews for this product I almost didn't buy it. Lots of complaints about pouring and taste. I have found that after reading reviews on many different products, a large percentage of the negative ones have to do with the user, not the product. When a reputable manufacturer has the same product on the market for an extended time you can be sure they will redesign it for legitimate complaints. I can't figure out why my pot had none of the problems many critics experienced. It performs perfectly has no pouring problems and the coffee is great. I recommend it highly and am glad I bought it.

Excellent variety of plan selection and skill levels .... As a freelance draftsperson this book is one of four by Sun Designs that I had thepleasure of assisting with. 'Classic Toys in Wood' was a truedelight as was the follow up book 'Making Timeless Toys in Wood'.Classic Toys in Wood contains 40 toy plans including; construction toys,a host of fun toys in the 'boat marina' theme, rocking horses, and more.The book itself contains 12 mini plans as well as an illustrated storyfor children.My niece was just a small child while I was working with theprotypes of these toys. She visited often and of course loved toplay test them. She especially liked the ferris wheel and allthe little people she could put on the ride.Unlike some mass made toys, these stood up to the rigors of play.Along with the mini-plans included in the book you will findexcellent step-by-step instructions and materials lists.Full size plans for all the toys shown in the book can be ordered directly from Sun Designs.$LABEL$1,0,-100

I was under the impression this was supposed to be a collection of his most important and/or greatest speeches to the nation. I was dead wrong!

If you can get past the shoddy camera work..... you might have been able to watch the entire movie without getting motion sickness. This paparazzi type of film shooting works well occasionally, and gives it a documentary type of feeling. However, when it is as often as it is in this movie you become very aware of the camera and its movements, which detracts from the story and the movie itself. All you become aware of is the CAMERA and the cameraman, and why the hell isn't he using a tripod or something?!?!? Don't most people want to get into a movie and empathize with the characters? I couldn't see how this was possible when we are constantly reminded that they are only actors being filmed by a shakey cameraman.The story was fine. A feel good film, sappy and happy.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Untruth in Advertising. The subtitle of this book is "Stories of Special Forces from Iraq to Afghanistan." Why then, is over half the book taken from the Vietnam conflict? And one of the stories is by that foul-mouthed self-promoting braggart, Richard Marcenko, a name that makes real navy seals wince in embarassment.There is not one original story in the entire book, and it's the only book I've ever purchased only to realize that I'd read it already.

Beautiful!. We chose this semi-flush mount for our newly remodeled kitchen to add a touch of elegance. It turned out to be very well made. The craftsmanship is very good and the detail is delicate. My only complaint is that the color was not quite the one we thought. It was described as "Etruscan Gold" and on the picture it had nice gold tone. The semi flush we received looked a lot darker, more like bronze color. In the afternoon light you can see the gold tone, but not at night. We decided to keep it anyway because it still matched the overall color scheme of the kitchen. It is a very good light fixture, we are happy with it, and it was easy enough for my husband to install.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not as advertised and ordered from Amazon/'s Audible Books. The Audible download was described as a trilogy, but it is not. It is only the first two books in this harrowing, fascinating and brilliant series of novels. Apparently the third book is lost in Audible cloud, but I have the Patrick Melrose quartet in one volume, and my sense of loss and agrievement has been assuaged.I will miss Patrick, and his brilliantly written, terse story when I've read the last volume. I will put them away, and pull them out in a few years and return to his world, so richly and unsentimentally described. St. Aubyn's deft portraits hit close to the grain, and will be as fresh 20 years from now as they are today. Cultures may change. People don't.So, no stars for Audible/Amazon, but five for these fast paced, deeply felt and entertaining novels. And buy the books, you will not like being cut off in the middle.$LABEL$0,0,-100
St. Valentine's Massacre. This is an awful book. His favorite character, Father Blackie, intrudes here and there, but the book is basically about an anchorman, his love life, and a mystery. The writing is poor and repetitious. Greeley (or his amanuensis) was just looking for fillers. Certain phrases are repeated...and repeated...and repeated. And how many times do we want to witness the lovemaking of the middle-aged anchorman and his train-of-thought adoration of his love? I felt like several someones forced themselves to sit down and write 300 words a day, not caring what had been written previously and not being sure where the plot was going.

Just another myth. While it is possible to get some power gains by insulating your intake tube (that is, only if the tube is being subject to large amounts of heat), it is just impossible to get "100 HP" gain and "50 MPG" fuel consumption. Such remarks would just come from someone who works for the company and is trying to sell the product. If these gains were true, all the companies selling the high end performance mods would go out of business with people buying this product.

Great idea, but will break very easily and won't work well on toilets!. I purchased this product after reading all the reviews and watching Claire's review video, but although it might work well on the bath tub or the sink, it does not work well on toilets. I tried unclogging my toilet possibly 10+ different times, but no matter how accurately I did it, my toilet is still clogged. Also, after less than 20 attempts, the pump broke and won't air seal broke and won't hold more than 4 pumps.

This movie was ok.... I gave this movie only 4 stars because it was not that belivable to me, and while a movie does not need to be.... this one i was expecting to be almost based off a true life story.Besides that though, this movie was relitivly a mild-paced movie, some parts were a little slow, and in the end there was a twist ending. This movie may not be the best movie to show to younger kids, because they may get afraid of the concpet of someone knowing their whole life and trying to kill people.Robin Williams did a good job, and all the characters in this movie were very well played! There was not much of a plot, but what they did have was pretty well planed.There was no "Thrilling" special/visual effects and no "Stand-Out" music, but that's ok because this type of movie does not require eaither.This might be a movie to rent though, as it is one of those that you can see twice and be done with.~Hope this helps$LABEL$1,0,-100

VERY HARD READ. This book is very hard to read. I have successfully made it 3/4 through the book, but it's because I have been forcing myself to continue reading. I do like some of the points the book makes, and think it has a wonderful message, just wish it was easier to read. Uses A LOT of big words that are not everyday words for the average person, which forces you to have to think longer on each sentence you read. Would find myself having to read the page 2-3 times in order to get the point. As said, it does have a great message, but I believe it could have been written as a better flow of words. I would only recommend this book to someone that is an avid Theological reader, not an average Christian looking to deapen their spiritual relationship with the Lord.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Amazon's Look Inside of 212 Degrees. I have to say that the "Look Inside" preview that Amazon has pout together for this book is totally useless. I use this function often and have purchased many books based upon the insight that it has given me. For 212 Degrees, it it essentially nothing but the cover and inside and outside flaps. That leads me to believe that the substance of this book is very weak and; therefore, I will not be making the purchase.$LABEL$0,0,-100
where did the old Dean Koontz go?. I have read all of Koontz's books and I anxiously awaited this book and after reading it, I knew the wait wasn't worth it. I had just read Odd Thomas and so hoped this new book would be better. Alas it wasn't. Where of where did our Dean Koontz of Dark Rivers of the Heart and Watchers and Dragon Tears, etc.go? He would so carfully craft a story and draw you into it so deep that you couldn't wait to finish it but you didn't want it to end. This book was so formulaic that you really didn't have to finish it to know what was going to happen. In his early books, every word he typed seemed important to the story. In this book, you have page after page of almost nothing but adjectives. I want my old Koontz back. This book was not worth the read.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Avons eyeliner gimmick!. I was introduced to Avon through a friend who sells it. I really wanted a superior product and there prices seems fair, checked out reviews and made purchase. I purchased Avon Glimmer stick in black and brown. I bought it from an avon store. I must say Im disapointed. I mean the stick breaks off easy (im gentle and dont even use it everyday), didnt even last 6 months.

Very Nice - Especially for the Price. I got this about two weeks ago, and now I've put it to a fair test: During driving. I think the so called "Shock Protection" saved it most of the time, after all, these aren't the worst roads. But suffice to say, it never skipped. So, it works great! However the car kit that came with it only worked one time when I hit PLAY, and it only made output in the left ear. Good thing I brought batteries! The AC Adapter is included as well and is a nice touch. The headphones included are high quality. Finally, I haven't tried the cassette adapter, for I have no use for it when I could have CD quality =) Why four stars then, and not five? Well, perhaps for the poor car kit, but also for looks. Looks don't matter though, that's a silly thing to judge, right? Go and buy it! $50!$LABEL$1,0,-100

First one had a broken dvd drive, would not recognize any disk, 2nd one windows would not work, third one has a bad modem. DO NOT BUY! I can't believe how much time and effort I have wasted, not to mention money because of having both stores do the set up and adware removal, only to go through this.

Totally Chuffed!!!. This is easily one of the top two or three metal albums of all time. This is the Reign In Blood of the Death Metal/Grind Core genre. Amazing lyrics, written with sheer honesty and brutality. As far as the music and songwriting goes, its furious and relentless. Pintado, Harris and Embury are songwriting gods. They combine speed, grind and crunch like no other. Support the mighty Naplam and buy this and then go see them live. If you get a chance to hang with them, I assure you, you won't be disappointed.

Good book, stupid layout. This book has a lot of good info and photos. But the layout is the stupidest thing I've seen in a book. Most of the photos are spread across two pages and since this book is quite thick, the centers of the pictures are curved and it ruins the photos. The info and the photos in the book should get 5 stars but the layout has ruined everything. They have also missed IL 2 which I believe is the most produced aircraft in history if not in the second world war. They have included aircraft models that are much insignificant but missed IL 2. Some would argue that IL 2 was a ground attack aircraft but not a fighter but almost half of this book is dedicated to bombers and other non fighting aircraft. I give 2 stars because it makes me mad to see all the good photographs in this book spread across two pages which looks like the author is mocking me.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Boring Workout. This workout is not without challenge. So, even though it starts out easy, some of the sections get your heart rate up and and you will work up a sweat. However, the fact that each segment begins with its own warmup makes it too disruptive to do as one complete workout. Also, Keli Roberts is by herself, there are no background exercisers, and she is just no fun at all. I found this workout incredibly boring.I recommend Amy Bento, Cathe Friedrich or Chalene Johnson for fun and challenging kickboxing workouts, but don't waste your time and money on this one.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not like the original one. I had really liked the original version of this book which is meant for slightly older children. So I got this for my 14 month old daughter.

One of the best technical analysis. This is, in my opinion, one of the best technical analysis books out there.The approach of Richard Wyckoff was developed in the beginning of the century and it still applies. He shows you, in great details, how through price, volume and trend lines you can identify what a stock is doing and what it is about to do. And he did all of it by hand!!!The system is pure and, if combined with other indicators, moving averages, etc. can be powerful.The book is full of technical information. It is condensed, not an easy read but worth every penny and it is one of the least expensive books out there.I highly recommend it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Controversy mistaken for depth. The only thing that makes this book even appear to be worthwhile is it's "controversial topic" (which is advertised right on the cover). I was so irritated with how awful this book was it took me over an hour to chill my brain enough to start a new one. So often controversy is mistaken for depth. This book had none. I thought it was going to be great but the more I read the more I was proved wrong. The characters are absurdly one-dimensional while constantly try to claim otherwise through out the book but ultimately don't. This book is not even worth the paper it is printed on. Normally if I don't like a book I donate to the thrift store or give it BCID on bookcrossing. This one I tossed directly into the recycling.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Prepare to be blown away!!!!!. "Fireproof" byfar surpasses "Above". The music is harder and has more of an edge. It's amazing how Rob can be screaming one minute and then singing softly the next. To those Christian alternative fans, this is a must have. The song "Further" is this album's equivalent of "Father", and it is amazing. The whole album will keep you head bobbing throught.

Not adequate. Bought these for my two adult chins. The male is tiny, but he was somewhat cramped in it and only used this until I added a fleece house - now he only uses this for a platform. It's also not heavy or stable enough for them to use as a platform - on shavings it will tip slightly and startle them when they jump on it. Additionally, they jump on it with enough force that the top comes off daily, so eventually I had to nail it down so they wouldn't fall on it awkwardly.The female is much longer than the male, and she looked really uncomfortable in this whenever she had to turn around in it. She too abandoned it, and I didn't even give her an alternate nest box.I know the price is attractive, but now I have two houses that I'm going to pull out and replace with more substantial, large boxes. I definitely don't recommend this house type at all.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I'll be a happy man is this is the direction the art world takes in the next few years...This book takes an empty approach to design... lots of white and black space with strange freeze frames of different video and web pieces.

This book is an entertaining collection of stories drawn from Indian myths and legends of yore.

Nuvi- inexpensive and satisfactory. I work as an Admissions counselor for a University and do a lot of traveling. Frustrated with the pages of directions from online map sites, I got advice from friends and tried the Nuvi. I've found it to be extremely helpful when finding high schools and colleges. It has also assited me in finding local food places. One great feature I've loved is the ability to search for hotels near my destination. The thing my boss loves is that he's saving money in printing and gas (yeah for not getting lost!)A couple of problems- I've found that the turning warning is about 50 feet off. (still need to call garmin help about that) Some businesses are slightly before or after the location that the Nuvi has recorded.I'm planning on buying at least one more for our admissions office, and am very happy with how the Nuvi has helped me to be on time to the various appointments that go along with my profession.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Pop-up top impossible to open and close. I was really excited to get a stainless steel water bottle with a pop top for exercising and a mouth large enough to put ice cubes in, at a decent price. Unfortunately I didn't heed the other comments about the pop-up top being hard to open and close. For me, it was next to impossible. The cap doesn't fit snug onto the pop-up top, so that when looped around your finger, it justs pops right off and the bottle falls to the floor or ground. Poor design. If you don't care about using the pop top (one of the main reasons I bought the bottle), this is a good bottle for the price.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great pacing and extremely enjoyable!. If you're a horror fan -- or more importantly a zombie fan -- than this is going to be on the top of your list of "must reads." The pacing is fast, the zombies are different enough and terrifying and the characters are fun to read about. There's also a good bit of tension thrown in. Smith does a great job of throwing monkey wrenches into his characters' lives... and it makes for a fun read. It starts out great, sets the mood and never really slows down.The writing style is accessible and concise and flows extremely well.This book deserves a spot right next to all your favorite horror novels.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Well worth the money. I suffered from Panic Disorder for more than 10 years. Every GP i saw told me i would never be cured and offered me medication to keep my anxiety under control. Thankfully I never accepted the drugs. When i was at the end of my tether feeling totally worthless and helpless, i found The Linden Method. I bought it, thinking i was maybe being conned as i was at my lowest ebb. I have to say i cried when i first started to read the manual. And the Panic Attack Eliminator was like an epiphany. The Linden Method is honest, safe and has a real understanding of how panic can control your life. The after sales support is also superb.I am not totally cured, but i know this is mostly down to me. The Method itself is sound, and if it doesn't completely cure you, I'm sure it will at the very least make your panic disorder much more manageable.Very strongly recommended.$LABEL$1,0,-100

This review is for the 3D Version - HORRIBLE - Don't waste your time!.... I've proudly collected most all 3D Blurays available in the US since the beginning. I must say that I ROBOT is the worst 3D conversion I've ever experienced. I actually sold it on ebay for $9. It looked like a pop-out book - simply unsatisfactory. FOX/SONY has boasted about their new techniquest to convert 2D Classics to 3D classics. Note to Fox/Sony: PLEASE DON"T RUIN ANY FURTHER CLASSICS IN YOUR CATALOG WITH THIS QUALITY CONVERSION. I was so Dissappointed - a Great Movie in a horrible 3D presentation.Sony/Fox should take some pointers from Pixar or James Cameron for the future 2D- 3D conversion. You thought Last Airbender 3D was bad - experience I-ROBOT and it makes the Airbender look like a classic. Shame on you Fox/Sony - Give us better quality 3D Conversions and we'll buy them.$LABEL$0,0,-100
AWESOME STORY. The photo of President Kennedy with future President Clinton in the crowd is eerily ironic. For you people looking for some kind of embarassing kiss & tell story, try another book. If you want to see how one of the great minds of our times work, this is the book. President Clinton's accomplishments were many. He was and IS loved around the world. This book celebrates him, and we applaud him! I am honored to have been alive during his years as our leader.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Don't Waste Your Money. Painful to watch. Baldwin , as usual, has zero ability to project ANY emotion whatsoever. Whatever scene he is in, he has the same expression and is unable to communicate any feeling at all through his eyes. Poor script and silly idea for a movie.

Bad Title. It's not a strategy book.. This is a book about openings. It's not your typical strategy book. Since it is an openings book, the material is very outdated. If you want to learn about the ideas behind the openings then I would recommend Discovering Chess Openings by Emms. If you are want a more detailed book on all the major openings then I would get Fundamental Chess Openings. FCO is a good reference book, but for the most part, it just lists moves and doesn't try to teach you about opening theory. If you are looking for a strategy book then I suggest Modern Chess Strategy by Pachman.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Norah's shining moment. Norah Jones may not have the keyboard proficiency of Dianna Krall nor the polished vocal range of Sade but she has what the others don't have - eight Grammys. Whether the Grammy was a one-hit-wonder glitch or a confirmation of her talents is a moot issue.What is obvious in this New Orleans performance is her artistry -- no embellishments, just simplicity and grace. Norah exudes femininity which is sometimes hard to convey in a jazz setting; her voice, oftentimes soulful and melancholic, comes across intimately in Lonestar, Bessie Smith, The Painter Song and the surprise encore Tennessee Waltz. Her now familiar "Don't Know Why" and "Come Away with Me", performed live, are enough reasons for having this DVD.In the musical world where artistic integrity are often compromised, it is nice to have for more than a 'brief shining moment' a lone star like Norah Jones.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A let down follow up cd.. I read in a magazine interview that Miss. Jones did not want to be seen as "Just A Jazz Singer" an on this cd she wanted to show her country music influence, which she got growing up in Dallas, Tx. On a side note she came out of the same perfoming and visual art school as fellow Dallas Texans, the great contempary jazz trumpter Roy Hargrove, and neo-soul singer Erykah Badu. Back to this cd, while I really like her voice, she is out of her league as some sort of neo-country female singer. Although the cd does have it's solid moments such as track 11 "The Prettiest Things." I give her credit for try to branch out into different sounds,but one must know what works and what does not. I hope that by her next new cd she knows the The quote of Miles Davis "Great Music, like great art is more define by what's left out, rather than what's put in."$LABEL$0,0,-100

Good Salesman, Bad Advice. Dr. Grey, with a PhD from a university closed down by the State of California as a diploma mill, is a great salesman and story teller. Although his thesis in his new diet and exercise book is intriguing, Grey does not give any references whatsoever as to from where his theories about hormones and their role in nutrition come. Some facts in the books seem dubious, "..the brain uses 20 percent of the calories we consume."However, because the caloric intake of his nutrition system should be less than the reader would normally take, participants in the system should show a loss of weight over time. And because the theory is novel, a reader will also tend to believe everything Grey says, as believe they "feel" better.I would feel safer about his nutrition ideas if he had added an appendix of references to scientific or even to popular literature that could confirm his ideas as good science.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not particularly moving. It's a nice, fast summer read, and I must admit to shedding a tear or two, but overall, I didn't like it.I don't think I'll be reading more James Patterson. For one thing, he is totally unconvincing as a 35-year-old female. I mean come on. There's this one line about an "upside-down ponytail" and it almost made me quit reading and throw the book against the wall in frustration. Funny how little things like that can throw off the whole experience. Generally for me, this was not dense enough to be a real romance. Badabing badaboom, they're in love. But why? No one knows.Anyway, if you're in the mood for a fluffy read, you might be ok with this one. Otherwise, skip it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Overpriced and incomplete. As per usual, my ratings given are for this release, and not for the content.Simply put, this is not a a true "Collector's Edition". It's priced as one, but it's not at all a complete edition, something on this scale and at this price should include all the original japanese language soundtrack with english subtitles.A real let down.Sadly even if you remember it in english as a child, you don't get that because the studio destroyed the original copies.

Not that great. First off, most of her songs are so repetitive that they get really annoying and irritating to listen to. The first 3 songs are somewhat more rock, but after that most of them just sound like mandy moore songs with a guitar. The lyrics aren't that great either, just the typical pop stuff going around now. One song - beautiful - even sounds like a brittany spears song. The only thing I can say about this album is that the songs, just like most songs on the radio now, get stuck in your head quite easily. Don't waste your money; go buy Brand New's album - Deja Entendu, or Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Adults' Fairy Tale. It is a true fable where all is well that ends well. Mr. Reiner writes with ease about persons with distinguished achievements, wealth, and health. Even the ones who are sick are made to seem fit. There is a reason behind everything and each character possesses great human values such as compassion and understanding. Even the ogre of the tale has his good sides. Of course, the whole story is light and full of mirth. That is Mr. Reiner's style. He knows how to make people laugh. There is a minor story within the main story. Both are equally enjoyable. Nat, the main character, suffers from serious personality disorder that he succumbs to seeing a therapist. One thing leads to another and he is on the journey of searching the truth of his origin. He finds out a lot of information and a few close relations. It is first and foremost a love story between men and women and among family members. When told in Mr. Reiner's wild humor, it becomes more pleasing.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Gift Book for the Spiritual Journey. This small format, hard cover gift book is a treasure. In 99 pages, we read a variety of quotations from Mother Teresa. Recurring themes include nature, prayer, and love. We learn that the attention she got from the media was a burden to her, endured willingly because publicity for her work drew attention to the poor. She found speaking in public torture, saying it was easier for her to bathe a leper than to answer a journalist's questions.The content of these brief passages is complemented by Mother Teresa's gift for language, for example, "I am only God's pencil, one that he uses to sketch whatever he wants," and "love's garment has a hem that reaches into the dust, and brushes it away." Every page has a message with the power to inspire.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not one of her better efforts. I get the impression that EP wrote this book(and set it in the past) because the Amelia Peabody series may be losing some of its appeal. After all, Amelia and Emerson are now getting old (hard to believe that Emerson can still be an ageless 'hunk' in those later books). So is EP trying to recall the 'glory days' of this series?I found the story and characters to be 'small' compared to her other books. This book was simply not up to the usual EP standard.On a more personal note. After ready all of the books in this series I am starting to grow weary of the pretentiousness, superiority and pomposity of the entire Emerson family.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Very True. This book hit me harder than any book I have read recently, not because of the writing, but because this was me. This was my college experience, ast least what I can remember of it :) and I can identify with many of the authors statements and feelings to be accurate. The scary part is that it is normal to use alchol like this in collage and early adulthood in america. Drinkomg untill you pass out is not abnormal but expected in many young adult settings and those that do not are not cool. This book is scary and true, and made me look at the way I drink.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A wonderful mix. What a wonderful mix of in-depth information about both Jean Shepherd's body of work (which to me seems timeless) and revealing interviews that draw Shepherd's enigmatic life and humanity into sharper focus. Bergmann does a fine job of explaining why Shep's fans are so loyal; what were Shep's best contributions to radio, TV, film, literature, and stage; and does this while making us aware of Shep's enigmatic less-than-perfect personal life. This latter subject, however, does not detract from portraying the man as an overall likeable character or significant artist. A great read for anyone, whether familiar with Jean Shepherd's work or not. Thank you Eugene Bergmann!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Died after 2 years. I bought this unit about 2 years ago. I had to return the initial unit because it did not work correctly (thanks to Cabellas customer service). The second unit worked well for a while (yes it was a long set-up), but we were happy with it. The rain guage stopped working pretty early on, as did the humidity/weather condition sensor. However, the 2 parts we used most, which were the temperature readings in and out and the anemometer, seemed to work very well until we hit the 2 year mark. Then the whole unit went out and no matter of new batteries, reset, or anything else will make the unit function. It might be inexpensive for a weather station, but $240 is not cheap by my standards to have the product only last for 2 years. Not sure that I can recommend it. Too bad, because I think Oregon Scientific usually puts out a good product.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Simple, acoustic-esque style with hints of Dido and jazz/blues overtones. Very satisfying purchase. "Colour the Small One" has a simple, near-acoustic rock style which, along with Sia's vocals, are reminiscent of Dido's "Life for Rent" and include many jazz and blues overtones. Guitar, brass instruments, synth organ, and even the xylophone are tastefully blended with both fast and slow percussion in amounts that are often quite complex, yet carefully avoid the "noise rock" effect. Unlike Dido, the lyrical content avoids any edgy or potentially offensive territory, making this album safe for any casual listening audience.

Another bulls-eye. Derber has hit the nail on the head again - in this case it's a bulls-eye, with Bush in the center. But much more important than Bush the individual is Derber's penetrating analysis of the corporate/political elites' control of our democratic processes. By exposing the underlying structure of this control, Derber gives us a meaningful vantage point to understand how the unabashed self-interest of a powerful minority negatigvely impacts the vast majority. I found Derber's upbeat style and witty presentation ultimately hopeful. It's a complicated topic, but this is a readable and important book. We need to wake up ourselves and our country to the reality of what's really happening under Bush (not to mention whoever wins in Nov) - let's demand our leaders and institutions do a much better job of implementing the fundamental ideals and human rights that our country was founded on and that we teach school children to believe in.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointing.... I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Carr, since this book is such a departure from his historical fiction ("The Alienist," and "The Angel of Darkness"--"The Alienist" is a masterpiece!). I was disappointed in this book. I don't know what Carr was trying to achieve with this novel, but it's a combination of mystery and science fiction that doesn't quite come off, in my humble opinion.It takes place in 2023, and it's mainly about the assassination of the President in 2018. The investigation into it takes the main character, psychiatrist Dr. Gideon Wolfe, through many confusing twists and turns, and I was left confused and wondering what Carr was trying to prove here. It was not easy reading, and it seemed as if the book had been written in haste--there was not the character development nor the detailing one expects from Carr's fiction.$LABEL$0,0,-100

This visual interest is as far as the movie's value extends unfortunately.There is no redeeming value to the storyline. This movie revels in perversion, sadism, and immorality. This is yet another movie in these troubled times that only adds to the fire and will further twist people's minds.Let's support good, wholesome, uplifting movies and art! When we focus on these things, then people's thoughts will be on these things. Inline attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors then result.Let's not wallow in this filth.$LABEL$0,0,-100
I feel like I'm caught in a web.... ...a web between 2 Mel Brooks movies that is:) This and 'The Producers'. This movie is one of thoes comedies when while you're watching it you are thinking: "this is so stupid!" but after the movie is over, you think about it a few days later, and start cracking up! My favorite part is probably the end when the camera busts through the wall, that is just too funny! Oh and by the way, if you're a Hitchcock fan, see this movie! If you don't know who Hitchcock is and have never seen his films- then this movie will not be funny to you at all. The only reason I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the other Mel Brooks classic- 'The Producers'. I think that 'The Producers' is probably just about the funniest movie ever, and definatley Brooks' best film, with 'High Anxiety' trailing behind:)$LABEL$1,0,-100
Good reading, but don't expect a business plan in it.. While it can be argued that this book serves as a promotional piece both for Mr. Dell and his company (which isn't a bad and unnexpected thing after all), there's real knowledge to be gained from it. If only Dell Computers human resources is run like the way he describes in part II of the book, his company is light-years ahead from the competition just by using a really down to Earth strategy. Add the kind of efficiency and speed they achieved, and you've got a "Star Wars Episode I: TPM" company against "Battlestar Galactica" competition (sorry couldn't resist, I'm in a SW mood eheh). People who want to know about the company's history and Dell's life will be disappointed, because "Direct from Dell" is more like a book on the "Dell's way of doing business".$LABEL$1,0,-100

Don't waste your time with this one!. Some people have said that this is an interesting and engrossing book, but I found it to be the very opposite! This book was VERY slow-moving; nearly the most sluggish book I've ever read. Details can enhance a book, or they can bring it down in readibility. This book is filled with the latter. Hal Borland has written some FANTASTIC books, but this is certainly NOT one of them. Fairly well-written and mildly interesting, this one is not worth your time or money.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not recommended. I purchased this wireless router hoping to replace my 3 years old LinkSys router. However, after playing with it for several hours, I decided to return it because of the following (using firmware 2.18):1. MAC filtering: Can't make it for wireless only. Once it is enable, it is for both wireless and wired network. This is the MOST annoying part. I mean, why do I want to enable MAC filtering for my wired network???2. Router configuration: Very primitive comparing to my old LinkSys.3. Enable/Disable Wireless: It didn't really disable the wireless network(physically). It shoulded be called "allow/deny all" access instead. Once the wireless is "disabled", it does still broadcast the SSID.4. No way of disabling SSID broadcast for security reasons.Finally, I have to give DLink credit for making upgrade firmware so easy (Web base), which is a big improvement comparing to my old linksys router.$LABEL$0,0,-100

If only I could give zero stars.... Yes, it's dumb, but no, it's not funny.And I love lowbrow humor. Like Dumb & Dumber...I laughed my hiney off and I'm no Carey fan. I rented this movie fully expecting something very stupid, and very funny.Well...it's very stupid, I gotta give it that... Only problem is that it never really got very funny. It looked funny from the commercials, but the problem is that those scenes were the ONLY funny parts of the movie. If you saw any commercials or reviews, don't bother renting or (heaven forbid!) buying the movie. You already saw the good parts.I just wanted to poke both of these idiots in the eye after about a half hour. I watched the whole dang movie waiting for it to "get funny"...and it never did. No matter how much I smoked, it just didn't ever get funny. And I usually like watching idiots blunder around!Just do yourself a favor and at least rent it before you buy...this isn't a good flick to buy on the assumption it's gonna be good.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Streamlight Stinger Battery. I purchased this battery on Amazon in November, 2009, from another supplier. Much like a couple of the reviews mentioned I received a battery "Made in China". I didn't think much of it at the time. It seemed to charge in the same amount of time and have about the same battery life as the OEM that lasted me numerous years.I have now noticed I get about 10 minutes on a full charge. My old "original" battery lasted me about 10 years and got me around 1 hour of use per charge. This is less than a year old and I have been using the flashlight the same as I always have.Moral of the story, in this case saving money will not be a benefit if you use your flashlight frequently. I will not buy a "Made in China" battery for my stinger ever again.I'm not bashing "Made in China" and I don't normally write reviews, but keep my review in mind when ordering.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Entertaining. Davy Bowman is growing up during WWII in Illinois and must deal with the changes going on around him. His brother, a pilot trainee joins up... his father, a WWI vet owns the local gas station and they are expected to ration food, rubber, gas, and other precious staples. He and his best friend travel around on their bikes savaging metal for the war effort.This was an entertaining (and educational) story of how a country pitched in to help each other during a time of crisis. I particularly enjoyed reading about the various characters that inhabited the town, and the cantankerous old teacher Miss Titus that put a mousetrap in her purse to thwart the class bully. My only complaint is that this book wasn't longer.Well worth a listen for adults and kids alike.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Up or Down?. Really torn on the movie.I loved the beginning, but found myself wondering right away, "Just how is this a kid's movie?" The plot was just too grown-up. Then they started haphazardly throwing in this random stuff obviously meant to amuse young children. It was uncomfortable.Don't get me wrong. The introduction was engrossing. The animation was great. Most of the characters were genuinely lovable, especially the old man and Kevin. But in the end, it just felt like an ugly patchwork - bits and pieces were extraordinary, but ultimately, everything clashed.For the record, I have no problem with talking animals or nonsense in a children's movie - I even expect them. And I truly love Pixar. But this film just didn't sit right with me. The idea was very adult-minded, and it didn't seem like Disney quite worked out what message they wanted to send to kids. Very confusing.Although I really enjoyed some parts, Up left me feeling down..$LABEL$0,0,-100

Weak conglomeration of narratives without much Big Picture. More than anything, this is a collection of first-person interviews with former operatives in OSS during WW2, weakly cobbled together with some uncritical filler narrative. Although there are some brief sections that touch on the broader challenges and decisions of the American intelligence effort, most of it involves repetitive first-person accounts of people hiding in the woods from the Nazis. If that sounds interesting, it isn't. I came away from the book with a modest understanding of what the guys on the ground went through, but with almost no sense of the strategic challenges that sent them there. Having said that, it is an easy read, if only because it is largely devoid of interesting ideas.I would not recommend this to someone who wants to understand the broad sweep of the American intelligence effort in WW2. I would recommend this to someone who has some interest in first-hand accounts of the operatives on the ground.$LABEL$0,0,-100
cool Buk novelty item. Bring Me Your Love is a 1983 short story by Charles Bukowski. The story itself is above average for Buk and far superior to There's No Business, which is offered by Black Sparrow Press in this same format. The R. Crumb art is very compatible with the tale. It's the story of a man visiting his wife in a mental institution and the conversations that follow. Typical Bukowski subject matter...madhouses, women, sex, booze & not much hope at all. If your shelves are already filled with the real Buk books, I would definitely recommend adding this to your collection. Keep in mind, we are talking about a fifteen page book here! There's not much tohold, hence the great price.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Bad From the Start. I purchased this product shortly after buying a home with a non-working furnace. I also purchased 2 space heaters from another vendor. The other vendors products have worked as expected (thank god), but the Honeywell space heater was defective from the first. I probably should have dealt with it sooner, but with painting, plumbing, and refinishing floors and all of the chaos that comes with a fixer upper I let it go.It runs well for about 3-5 minutes and then shuts off. I susppect a defective heat turn-off. I called the service number on the bottom of the unit and was told to mail the unit for a replacement. The cost of shipping was to be paid by me. Since this was a cheap unit, and they were going to replace it with another cheap, possibly defective unit, I decided to save the shipping cost and just toss this thing in the trash.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Nice but not good for every day use. I bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy. I liked the stroller with air-filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel-locks. However, this stroller is so cumbersome if you have a compact car. Even with my Acura, I still have to take apart the front wheel to fit the stroller in the trunk. Imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk. It's inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car's trunk.

Strong Vacation Read. The two biggest complaints about the book are the existence of stock characters and less than believable plot twists.I found the characters strong. Perhaps they were not multifaceted or three dimensional, but it wasn't like the protagonists had no negative attributes or you had no sympathy for what the chief antagonist, Nicky, must have gone through in life.I am confused by what other reviewers found unbelievable in various plot twists. Biggest plot twists are premised on the fact that organizations, legal or illegal, seek to safeguard their assets in a variety of ways, legal and illegal. Good people make poor choices. None of these are shocking.I tried and failed to read this book traveling on Amtrak with my children, but that was more because of their behavior. I then read it thoroughly in about 4 days. Good read, interesting information, challenging focus. I strongly recommend you read this all at once as there are a lot of twists and turns.$LABEL$1,0,-100

unbreakable carafe, breakable components. I've had mine for about a month and the ring around the screen on the plunger has already come off and doesn't appear to want to go back on. In general, I think the screen/plunger piece does not fit well and lets a lot of air (and grounds!) pass through the ring, no matter how slowly or carefully you press down the plunger.This may be okay for camping trips since the carafe seems very durable, but I do not recommend this for daily home or office use.

Powerful stories from another world. I first came across this book while reading Francine Prose's "Reading Like a Writer." She provided a short excerpt from "A Distant Episode" and I was intrigued.That particular story - the first in this collection selected by Bowles - was perhaps the most arresting, but they were all interesting. Each story quickly draws you into an exotic world with characters and settings that are palpable.Perhaps I was most taken in by how different each of the stories seemed to be. From a horrifying, violent descent into obscurity and insanity to a simple collection of letters by a single author. From compact, intense stories to a meandering walk through the life of an older, single woman in a foreign place.These images have stayed with me long after I put the book down.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Very Disappointed. As a single parent, I was quite excited to order this baby book....but I was horribly disappointed when I received it. Since it is hardbound, it's difficult to remove the pages that are not relevant to me. In addition, the paper was poor quality and the printing looked as if it was produced on a home ink-jet printer. The screen printing on the cover looked as if it was also done at home.I found one that was much higher quality, offered as much flexibility for 1/2 the price. The $40 price tag on this is just ridiculous.While I do think there need to be more baby memory books for alternative families, they do need to be high quality and offer the flexibility to remove irrelevant pages. My situation didn't speak to any of those covered in the book.Also, let's be realistic....do you really think you're going to fill this out until your child is in 12th grade?$LABEL$0,0,-100

Excellent and Realistic Literature. This autobiography gives new meaning to the word realistic. It is funny, sad and gruesome at times. Obviously, this book does appeal to the wrestling ethusiasts, but I recommend all read it. It brings new light to the so-called "fake" sport of wrestling. I believe those who read it will gain a new respect for wrestlers, considering the time and effort they devote to the profession they love. Overall, the book is great. Surprisingly, all those shots to the head did not affect Mankind's literary talents. The generally summarizes the life of Mankind from the time he was eighteen to now.

Horrible Book. I ordered this because it was compared to Mary Higgins Clark. There is no way this book or author could compare to MHC. Although the storyline sounded interesting, it not only drags on with an endless history lesson given by the characters, but one would get the impression that everyone in the 1500's was either gay or had no moral character whatsoever. The language and sexual content in this book is not something I want or should be needed in a successful novel. Mary Higgins Clark has been writing books for more years than I can count, and she has never needed to put smut or language in her books to have them pouring off the shelf. After reading about 1/2 of the book, and getting way too many sexually explicit pictures in my head, I had had enough, and decided to forget trying to finish it. Too bad you can't get a 'money-back-guarantee' on books.This author has alot of work to do to present a book with decent substance.$LABEL$0,0,-100

If you want rap music you can listen to with your parents, then go buy "A Tribe Called Quest", at least they are originators.

I would say that it is one of the best books on discipline and classroom management and worth every penny that you might spend. I would recommend buying this book and it should cover most of your needs for classroom management in high school.$LABEL$1,0,-100
What the heck DVD doesnt work on DVD player. When I bought this I was all excited and ready to roll. I popped it in the DVD player and it doesn't even work. I got busy doing something else and am too late to send it back, plus it was no Amazon but some contract via Amazon. I think you are better off if you try to stick strictly with Amazon and avoid the discounts. Oh well win some loose some.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Thoroughly Entertaining!!!!!. I recently came across Terror in the Aisles in my local video store and rented it thinking it was a different movie. What I got was an awesome compilation of some of the older, classic horror films.Terror in the Aisles is hosted by the Late Great Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen. They take us through over 70 horror flicks in just under 90 minutes. Some of these movies include, Halloween, Jaws, Friday the 13th, Psycho, Carrie, The Exorcist, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few. Also, there is a brief appearance by, the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock. There were also a few movies which I have not seen that look particulary interesting such as, When a Stranger Calls and Nighthawks.If your a fan of horror movies then you must see Terror in the Aisles it's well worth a look.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The worst film I ever saw. I'm an avid fan of campy zombie and slasher films, but this is the worst I have ever seen. Bad acting, poor videography, amateur special effects .... the list goes on. The only thing going for it is that it ends, and not too soon. I like Troma films (Cannibal: the Musical being one of my favorites), but something went wrong here. Don't waste your money.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not as good as I thought it would be. I saw all the positive reviews and one review stating that it was better than the Leaf (basically the two I narrowed it down to) and I was disappointed after buying the TREK. I'm on the 4th floor (top) of my building in Miami, FL and I have the antenna pointing directly at the towers (about 25 miles away). I only get three channels. I don't get CBS, NBC or anything pertinent except FOX. Pretty much useless.UPDATE: 9/18/2012I bought the LEAF PLUS and it worked a bit better than the Trek. It is WAY more aesthetic though. The trek is too bulky. I used the LEAF at my fathers house as a test and was able to get over 20 channels. At my apartment I only get about ten so take that into consideration on my initial review.In the end, the LEAF PLUS is the winner.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Good electric kettle. I had used one in the past and was very pleased with it so I ordered this one. It's an excellent kettle with one flaw. The base of the kettle has changed and not for the good. The top of the base that I used before was flat. This one is rounded and the kettle has some little "feet" that are totally useless so the kettle doesn't really sit solidly on the base. Other than that I would have given it 5 stars.$LABEL$1,0,-100
"Religious Fanatics Can Make It Be All Gone...". Still as good today as it was 20 yrs ago. Frank has this uncanny ability to create music that lasts throughout the generations. From women in the military to deadheads looking for freedom from their parents, this album hits hard. Frank pokes and prods the religious right with heavenly bank account, the meek shall inherit nothing and the classic Dumb all Over(Maybe W should listen to this one!!!) Does humor belong in music? Absolutely, and no one does it better and with the worlds most amazing band than FZ!!!$LABEL$1,0,-100

The best book I read on preparing to have a new baby. The book focuses on the most important relationship to a baby--how the parent's relate to each other after the first child is born. The stability and love (or lack thereof) in the parental relationship creates the environment in which the child is raised. Men and women have different expectations and reactions to the birth of a child. This book is a long-term case study of what types of marriages grow stronger, stay the same or get weaker as a result of the birth of a child. The insights I gained helped me to modify and be aware of issues in my marriage that having children creates. I believe my marriage has grown stronger after children and part of the reason was the insight gained from this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Classic!. When A Christmas Story first came out in the early 1980's I saw it three times because I kept dragging friends to view it. I bought a video copy when it came out on VHS; and I bought the DVD version when it came out a few years ago. This current DVD edition is the best yet. Compared to the orginal DVD, which I looked at for the sake of comparison, this 2003 edition has a much clearer image, better color, and a more balanced contrast. Although I have not been able to find any statement verifying my conclusion, I feel strongly the film has been digitally remastered for this special edition. As a result viewing this classic is more of a pleasure and delight than ever. I am very grateful for the fine technical job that Warner Brothers did on this release.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Tad Disappointed. While I am a big fan of Ms. Moore and have been since she arrived on the music scene, the addition of hubby and fellow crooner Kenny Lattimore could have been left off. To me, her voice has always been strong and overshadows Kenny's. The concept of for lovers (always a good theme) kinda left me hanging on this CD because except for the title track (the best on the CD) and Loveable (From Head to Toe), the CD is remakes. I would have thought that these 2 contemporaries would have come up with original material. I really hate to give the CD 2 stars because my love for Chante but I heard nothing other than what was mentioned earlier that made me go Wow. For those considering the purchase of this CD, be forewarned - if you don't like remakes, this is not the CD for you.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A Masterpiece. This dvd is so good that you should not waste time reading this review. Just get it. Yeah it's that awesome. The animation is far beyond most contemporary anime. The character are beautifully drawn with incredible detail and the colors are so vivid that the environments seem to come alive. Besides the technical aspects the story is complicated, but very enjoyable. The action is fantastic. Kenshin deals with his foes in a savage yet graceful manner that causes your draw to drop while the blood gushes. This dvd has something for everybody the only problem is that it may make most of the other stuff you've seen look like Garbaaggee.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Seybold tells us a lot of stories and examples, but does not include concrete information on how or what should be done in order to really build an customer centric e-business.As a basic, first time introduction it maybe okay - but please don't use this as your guide to building a business.

too different from the earlier edition. I came across a very early edition of this book and thought it was great, but it was out of print. I thought that this book would be similar but there were major differences. While the earlier edition provided extensive word lists organized around the consonants, this book was organized around vowels. The only word lists that were based on consonants were much shorter in comparison. Although I sent the book back and can't reference it, I seem to remember that they were around 15 to 20 words long. Also, while the words in the earlier edition were useful for adults, the words in this later edition seemed to be geared toward children. For me, the book went back, although someone who is focused on vowels and working with children would probably find it useful.$LABEL$0,0,-100

massively overrated. Rick Linklater brought this movie off on a shoestring budget: it follows, without a story, the various reflections of residents in the student ghetto area of UT Austin.I've always thought this movie was greatly overestimated: there are some good lines, but not really "dialogue." Pretty much all the characters talks the same: like Richard Linklater, presumably. It's really just a continuous, occasionally amusing monologue that simply drifts from one character to another.Linklater went on to do some legitimately good films, but this one, his third film, hardly deserves the massive study edition that this Criterion Collection edition is.$LABEL$0,0,-100

However, unless your child is really having a hard time with spelling you don't want this! The word list are below grade level! It was a waste of time and money.

Best Green Day CD. This CD is just so cool. All of the songs just have so much substance. It's so fantastic. I love the lyrics and the tune of the songs.

Silly and stupid. Both my wife and I are into gaming, but not this type of dress-up/act out gaming.Unlike some other reviewers here, I didn't think the "players" gave it their all. They were ignoring "game decorum" every 10 seconds or so, so it really made everyone look half-hearted and silly. There were a few comedic moments here and there which were ok, but the drama was totally uninteresting. Maybe there is a good story here somewhere, but neither my wife nor I could get into this film.A big thumbs down for us!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Way Over-hyped. As a lifelong Beach Boys fan I had hoped SMILE would live up to the billing and hype of the reviewers...was I wrong!I recall listening to many of these silly songs while in college in the early 70's on the SMILEY SMILE ambum. Nothing profound here for sure. PET SOUNDS is the Beach Boys masterpiece that deserves all the adulation and hype one can bestow...it is truly a brilliant symphony of youthful hopes, dreams, and emotions. Recently I've gained a new appreciation for Dennis Wilson's songs before his demise, perhaps as heartfelt and deep as any Beach Boy explored. Forever.$LABEL$0,0,-100

My Guide To The Movie Guide. This guide was great I loved it. This Book has an Intruduction written by Viggo Mortenson. This Guide is filled with pictures of sences from the movie and parahagraphs to explian them. It gives some information that isn't clear in the second movie and is important information that will build up events in the third movie. This guide gives you backround information on some of the charactors in the movie. Such as gollum, Faramir, The ents, and many other charactors in the movie. It also tells you about places in Middle-earth such as The Dead Marshes, Ithilien, and ect.This guide also shows you how battle scences happen and how they are created.

Better on the radio. With songs like "Still of the Night," "Here I Go Again," and "Don't Turn Away" I figured this album would be one awesome album. Every song seems to be the same, all about love, but for some strange reason it only works on the above songs. The other 6 songs on the album are decent enough to listen to but they just don't rock.1 great song, 2 good songs, and 6 mediocre songs do not = a good album.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Useable Recipes for Busy People. Opening this book, I found a layout of table arrangements, alluring food photographs, Paris cookware shops, and recipes so common that I just wasn't sure anyone would need another book on these classics. Yet, to my sweet surprise, after examining the book closer, and cooking some of the dishes; I found a lovely and very useful book. Ina Garten has put together a choice collection of French classics that fit the American palate. In an easy cooking format, she's modified recipes to fit busy schedules, but seriously the dishes hold their flavor and are well thought out. I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted to cook French food; especially time deprived cooks. Its recipes take you to the market for fresh produce; allowing you to feel how simple a dish can be, yet so gourmet at the same time. Barefoot In Paris shows what's really going on in home kitchens set out over the beautiful countryside of France, and that simply put; is great cooking!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Horrible implementation of great product. This product is Wonderful and Terrible. It's extremely frustrating that it isn't better implemented. As many are trying to increase their intake of fresh vegetables, this product makes it so much easier. The downsides are - It appears to be made with a polycarbonate plastic which contains BPA and I'm assuming it contains that. The other complaint is that the water reservoir leaks all over the counter. I'd be thrilled to pay $80.00 for this product or more if it were just made better. The timer and keep warm features are great. Vegetables have never tasted so good or been more convenient. Please fix this and increase the price.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Only good if you are incredibly out of shape!. After my first two years in college, I wanted to lose some of the weight I had gained. This DVD was cheap and I needed to tighten up my arms so I bought it. All I can say is I did this about twice and now it's collecting dust. Like another reviewer said, it is boring and the instructor talks way too much. I'm really not used to working out a lot, especially my arms but I found this too easy and way too boring. They definitely could have cut out some of the talking and made it quicker. It would be good to do if you only have a couple minutes but the lengthiness of it due to unnessecary talking makes that impossible. For 35 minutes, I expect to get a more worthwhile workout.$LABEL$0,0,-100

uplifting harmonies. The first three tracks on this cd alone will make you happy you purchased it. Beatitudes starts with "blessed are.." and no matter how bad your case of the blues, you will raise your head by the end of the song. Run, Run, Mourner Run showcases not only the separate harmonies working together but a playful interaction with the live audience as well. Wade in the Water is a fluid, soulful rendition of this church song. All of the good reasons you might go to church are contained in these songs. The cd continues with adventurous harmony, political statements and rises to climactic endings as in Our Side Won.

Surprisingly lackluster. This album is definitely a new sound for Roena. Unfortunately I don't think this new sound went well for him since it really sounds generic and nothing really stands out in this album. The only track I found good was "Hablame Mi Amor", which was still does not have a remotely equal effect as "Tu Loco Loco" or "Avisale a Mi Contrario." This is one Roena album I would skip. Only good reason to buy would be to complete a collection.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Loved It. Everyone that has commented seem to think the movie was awful.. Me on the other hand has never watched the Avartar Airbender cartoon.. So maybe I don't know what it should have or shouldn't have been .. But I really enjoyed the movie.. And i'm a strong movie buff of any Fantasy Movie as long as their is a story line.I actually hope their is a 2 on the horizon. And any way it was only for entertainment.. Not to build my life on.. So i give it a big thumbs up and to me the special effects was awesome.The actors did a good job on bringing to movie to life. I wasn't trying to pick the movie a part but to enjoy the movie. But then thats just my opinion. I would recommen you watching it and forming your own opinion.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The first attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis. Now in a new edition edited and with an introduction and annotation Jon Sweeny, The Road To Assisi: The Essential Biography of St. Francis was first published in French in 1894, as the first attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis, one of the most beloved figures of Christian history. Author Paul Sabatier struggled to answer the question: who was Francis the man? Groundbreaking research reveals the a fully human portrayal of a man who was nonetheless gentle, passionate, joyful, and who desired to live as Jesus once taught his disciples. An extraordinary work that covers Francis' weaknesses as surely as his strengths, enhanced by the annotation and sidebars that place events of Francis' life in historical context. Highly recommended for individual reading as well as biography shelves, and a must-have for library collections.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Quite Mediocre. I only purchased it because I was in downtown Phoenix for a conference and couldn't find a real book store within walking distance. I was stuck with the hotel's W.H. Smith and the NY Times bestseller list (blech.)This book is a fast, pleasant read. The early portions were quite promising, evoking a feeling of creeping doom. I also liked the sprinkles of social commentary, particularly the discrimination fathers face in custody proceeedings.However, the plot quickly became utterly -- and I mean utterly -- predictable. The only suspense left for me was seeing just how long it would take the main character to figure out what I had figured out, and details of the resolution. The last portions degenerate to a long "beat the unstoppable monster" sequence.Might make a good movie on the Sci-Fi channel.Save your money.

Brilliant. Many might feel with this effort that Welsh is merely rehashing Trainspotting...in fact all of the major characters from that story make a brief appearance in Glue. Nevertheless, though Welsh's familiar themes of drug abuse, sex and delinquency abound, Glue is a story about people.The book details the life of four close friends growing up in Scotland from the 1970s into the new millenium...through troubles and joys. It is a fun read told with Welsh's unrestrained yet stylish flair. The human element is very strong here...we see the four friends in every light; what brings them together, what drives them apart and ultimately the tragedy that they must all overcome. It is a sad and beautiful story, yet more upbeat than some of Welsh's previous works. Personally, I think it is his finest. If you enjoyed Welsh's other efforts, definitely pick this one up today. It is worth every page.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Dragged down by a boring story and poor writing. It seems that around the late 90s, Koontz was developing a rather wordy, pompous writing style. This book, along with False Memory, is bogged down by puzzling analogies, irritating metaphors, and questionable word usage. We all know Koontz is a great writer, but at this point he begins showing off too much, which is really off putting.Despite the above, a Koontz novel can be saved by a compelling plot. This book doesn't even have one, however. The mystery surrounding this tale is hardly intriguing, and it's a struggle to maintain interest throughout this book.Only read if you feel the need to round out Koontz's bibliography.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Boring. This movie is one hour and twenty-one minutes long and was released on January 1984. As for a plot there is none. A few breasts scenes and some sword action but that is it.

It will infect your very soul! (4.5 stars). Spiritualized make it 2 releases in a row to make it to my annual best of list.Let It Come Down, much like 1997's Ladies and Gentlemen..., has all the beauty and deep passion Mr. Pierce can muster. It floats through the air with rousing gospel choir choruses, thunderous horns and big guitars, all set against his familar dreamy backdrop of orchestration and melodies.The first single, Stop your crying, can almost trick you into thinking this is a far more simple release. But as with all of the Spiritualized catalog, good things come to those who wait... 4 or 5 minutes. Each track is as haunting as the one before, as gripping as a drugged man yearning for a companion.Achingly beautiful.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A reply to Carlson. The book is an edited collection of essays protesting what its authors regard as the undue hegemony of liberal/progressive/PC ideology in clinical psychology. Many of the opinions expressed are reasonable, well supported by fact, and long overdue. Meanwhile, even those I find wrongheaded are largely to the left of Fox News, the WSJ editorial page, and Mussolini. The citations in Roger Carlson's review are caricatures of what is actually said; for this the only remedy is to read the book and draw your own conclusions. Like Carlson, I am a clinical psychologist (and yellow-dog Democrat), yet he strikes me as the sort of doctrinaire zealot who could easily end up in Hell sharing a room with Karl Rove.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The best Beethoven I ever heard. The Furtwängler's performance of Beethoven's Fifth is simply the best I ever heard. The interpretation is powerful, full of passion and intensity.

I was very pleased.... I don't understand why this movie isn't more popular. It, honestly, is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a while. It definitely kept me on the edge of my seat and it definitely kept me captivated. Everything is really good: the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the music, everything. Kate Greenhouse plays her role perfectly and Paul Fox does a great job putting this film together. And the plot is simple yet it's really creative (the twists totally caught me off guard).

Very enjoyable, recommended for people who love words. Poplollies and Bellibones-My friends and family collect and share words and this a book that's worth hours of discussion and joy. A mix of words, some of them with very precise meanings that don't have a modern equivalent in common use, others more that are more general. It also has a bit of the history of some of the words including the etymology and time period.The illustrations are very 70s style and the words are placed in a narrative context with notes about what each italicized word means.Tenderfeet and Ladyfingers by the same author has the origin of many phrases in use today, as well as more historical words. It's a fun mix of things relating to body parts in rich, descriptive and fun language.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Wonderful novel about life today!. The cover of "Autumn Leaves..." caught my attention and before I even knew what the book was about I knew I had to have it. I was by no means disappointed. This is a wonderful novel about love and friendship, life and death. There were many times in the course of reading that I was cheering, clapping, yelling and crying. The main characters were portrayed vividly from the sweetness of Legacy to the horrendous Simpson. I felt Marshall's grief and Jasmine's betrayal. This book touched on social issues that we all deal with today such as instant wealth from playing sports, unprotected sex and how AIDS impacts on so many people. This book is a must read. You won't be disappointed.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Polish my demo. I bought this CD on the strength of the two downloadable tracks here on amazon, and that other people bought it with purchases that I also have. It's pretty dissapointing: the synth choices are on the clunky side, the drum tracks are unimaginative, the male vocal is weak -- the staple and bane of synth bands, it seems -- but the female vocal is arranged so badly it is funny. Some nice melodies there, but nothing groundbreaking or energetic. Only the last three tracks of disc two made me sit up.What this thing seems to need most is a good producer who can take this material to the next level. Right now it just sounds like really accomplished home-made demos.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Cheezy rape fantasy.... I think the movie should've been titled either "Sorrow Man" or "Jealousy Woes". What in God's name were they thinking? Those effects took hours, days, weeks, months, FOREVER! And all for what? So we can learn that an invisible "genius" can get jealous and kill all his friends? Well, I can't say I expected anything more from the director of Showgirls and Basic Instinct. On second thought, maybe I did a little, because I enjoyed Total Recall and Starship Troopers. (And just between you and me, I liked both Showgirls and Basic Instinct.

Thor - Another Gem in the Marvel Series. Thor is a movie that has to be looked at on a number of levels. The action and effects is outstanding. The movie scenes are rich in design and colors projecting an art deco version of Valhalla. The action scenes are loaded with drama and in some cases with elements of humour. What is unexpected is underlying theme of loss and redemption, a raw callous youth coming to understand responsibility is all about. Thor's banishment to Earth, his realization of loss, and his redemption through being to willing to sacrifice his life to preserve planet is a theme one does not expect in a live action comic book. Thor works on all levels. There may be a few problems with the script and some parts that should have gone on the cutting room floor but overall a very enjoyable flic.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A very good performance. Klemperer always works wonders with Bruckner, bringing out the warmth and musicality of the piece. This version is a little slow, but this symphony is supposed to take its time. If one plays it too rapidly, a lot of the inner melodies and colorations get lost. You won't go wrong with this recording.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because Klemperer's versions of the Bruckner Sixth and Fourth (the latter with the Bavarian Radio Symphony - not the studio recording) are just so outstanding that they are in another realm.$LABEL$1,0,-100

I know they couldn't include everything in the book into a 2 hour movie. They stayed true to the book with no noticeable changes in the movie. I think Pattinson and Reese were good choices for the lead. I think the chemistry between Reese and Robert was good which made it believable. They made a beautiful couple.

Defective material. After reading the reviews I bought this for my daughter heading off to college. Got the first one home, unboxed filter with intent to clean and prep for her first use. I set the filter on the counter and heard a crack. Looked at the base and saw the left side cracked. Frustrated boxed up took back to the store and exchanged it. Brought the next one home, cleaned it and soaked filter. Boxed it up and took to daughters apartment. Started to fill with water when I noticed the blue inner resevoir had 2" crack around the lip.After a little more research I have read many complaints of the same filter cracking without reason. I exchagned for a Brita at Target. When asked the customer service rep told me they never see the Brita returned but has seen the Pur returned a number of times. I should have done more homework before buying and saved multiple trips to the store.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Very Disappointed in the Second Edition. The first edition of this book had many inaccuracies which are too numerous to mention here. I was greatly looking forward to the second edition, and the correction of the many discrepancies that were written in the first edition of Beauty in the B. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The book continues to be innacurate in many ways. For example, there is a picture of Rhoda Scott playing a Hammond B-3000, with a caption saying that it was manufactured by Hammond Suzuki. This organ was never manufactured by Hammond Suzuki. It was made by the old Hammond Organ Company. This inaccurate information was also in the first edition of the book. This is but one of the examples. Mr.Vail would have been well-served to have Alan Young review the entire book before publishing it. The effort of compiling the information for the book is to be commended, but the inaccuracies are too many to overlook.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not what I wanted.... I am moving to the UK in a few months, and wanted to get an overview of the various soccer leagues (FA, Premiership, etc.), the organization of the teams, etc. This book provided little to none of this. It appeared only to give a detailed (I mean detailed) history of all the teams. I still can't tell you how the various leagues are set up, how teams move to different leagues, etc.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Ascended Master BOB?. Along with his fellow Great Cosmic Noble Ascended Master friends Rex, Billy Ray, Jethro, Big Bubba, and Jenny-Lee (who is clad throughout the book in a Great Cosmic Tee-Shirt with "I Wish THESE Were Brains!" printed on the bust), good old Bob churns out one heck of a Great Cosmic Discourse on such matters as Supply, Love, America, Rising Into the Sky, and Healing flesh wounds incurred from birdshot.This is a real page-turner. Bob relates his life and times on the ranch with Pearl and Ascended Master Bob Jr., describes how he was able to raise his body straight up into heaven by saying the word I AM one-trillion consecutive times, and reveals the Great Cosmic All-Time Secret Formula for subduing an angry rattlesnake ("rattlers," he calls them) with a single kiss of the lips.*Spoiler:At the end of this book, you learn that God's "True Name" is not I AM after all.

Innovative and delicious romantic comedy!. I loved this book! I don't know how this author keeps coming up with such innovative plots, but this is definitely one that would make a great movie. I adored Dorsey, fell in love with Adam, and was amazed by the way the secondary characters like Carlotta and Lucas jumped right off the page into my heart. And as always, Ms. Beverly's writing sang with style and charm. So many books today seem sort of generic, but this writer's voice is so strong it keeps me coming back for more.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Amazon Kindle. The Kindle makes reading such a pleasure. I have always enjoyed reading, but this makes it much better. I often read more than one book at a time, one profesional, a personal help, and some fiction. Now I can have them all in the Kindle and do not have to cart several books around. It also means being able to read without glasses. As the day goes on, sometimes my eyes get tired and I need to put on a pair of reading glasses. Not with the Kindle, I just increase the font.Oh, and it is so much easier to travel with a Kindle instead of books. The only drawbacks I have seen are not being able to use it during take-off and landing, and not being able to share books with friends. Otherwise, I can see it becoming a Kindle world.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The Movie Exagerrated. An American Haunting is based on the Bell Witch, of the Bell Farm in Tenessee. The witch is said to haunt the place and "torture" the bell family, mostly John and Elizabeth, known as 'Bestsy', by slapping her, etc. In the movie, it is said that the 'ghost' was just Betsy's "innocence" that haunted the family after John Bell raped her. That is not true, the witch was there for a very long time, back when the indians/Native Americans roamed there. The movie had exagerrated way, way too much, but it was still ok.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Razor communication with your computer. I know you've heard it before, but this really is a great deal. My new Razor V3xxx is a terrific phone but is doesn't really reach it's potential until you connect it to your computer. The software and cable allow you to take control of your phone and use it the way you want. Why pay for ringtones and wallpapers when you can select your own. This saves you money right there. Installation of the software is easy but remember not to install the cable until it specifically instructs you to do so.The only criticism is why wasn't this included with the phone. We know the answer. If there is anyway for the big companies to make extra money with an accessory or aftermarket item it will happen.Overall, great buy!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointing!. Also waited 3 months for this DVD to be delivered. Agree totally with prior low reviewers. Color is terrible, smudges evident, timing of narrative vs scene out of whack, and the worst narrator ever. Completely distracting to hear the narrator's mispronunciations.

Snow Falling Off a Cliff. I liked the great amount of detail Guterson went into with this novel. However, it was getting to the point where I wish he would have gotten on with the story. It was just way too long for the point he was trying to get across about this small bigoted town in Washington in the 1950's. I think that he should have gone into more detail regarding the conclusion than everything else in the novel. When I got to the end, I was like, "this is it?!"

Save your money. Total ripoff. Less than an hour including extras, more shots of crowd members than players, and the boring voice-over frequently reminding us that this is the only tennis tournament that really matters doesn't help a whit. A truly pointless dvd with very little tennis. Summing up hundreds of matches in about 30 minutes of footage? You do the math.Might be worth buying only if you were there and hope to see yourself in the many audience shots. Otherwise, with barely any tennis on the disc, what's the point? Pure fluff.Go instead to the infinitely better Classic Matches at Wimbledon series; the Borg/Mac 1980 dvd has more quality in five minutes than this does in 55, and costs half as much.Passola.$LABEL$0,0,-100

The time has arrived!!. The time has come for the youngest BSB to break off and start on his own. Nick Carter's new album "Now or Never" hit stores today. With his new take on the world, Nick is taking the music to the next level. His songs about love are not the usual Backstreet tunes we are use to. It is safe to say, Nick Carter does a great job of telling the fans how much he loves and cares for each one of them. His songs are the kind when you hear the upbeat sounds, you want to dance all night. And when you hear the melodies, you feel he singing them right to you.

She has a great voice, she does speak sanskrit, however, she also gives you the english name for the postures as well.

Less Funnier Than The First And Over-rated. Meet The Fockers is a seuqel that was disappointing to me. As I progressed through the first 20 minutes of the movie, I figured it will probably get funnier. To my suprise, it actually did. But then the movie progressed into a bland tasteless comedy after the second half of the movie. The movie tries to reach its goal of being hysterical but sinks into a bland comedy. Although, I did like the idea Of Hoffman and Stressiand being in this film. They were enjoyable to watch. Although Robert DeNiro is less funny in this film and quite boring. I couldn't stand watching him in this film. He just got on my nerves. He was funny in the first one, but now he is just the opposite for me in this sequel.$LABEL$0,0,-100

You really don't want to read this. The marketing for this book is intriguing. Catchy. And not just for children. Using the negative to get one's attention works for adults as well. "Don't read this. This is bad. You're not going to enjoy it. Nothing good happens." Unfortunately, not only does nothing good happen, but all the one-star reviews I've read are accurate. This is a bad children's book. This is a destructive book, with dark themes that have no redeeming value, not even the author's inclusion of vocabulary words. It's a sign of our culture, which has become mesmerized by what's ugly and demoralizing, something much easier to strive for and achieve than that which is beautiful and inspiring.$LABEL$0,0,-100
This book was absolutely amazing.... This book is filled with numerous short stories, the themes of all speak to the struggle of Puerto Rican emmigrants to the US. Specifically in Harlem, New York. Although on the surface the stories may seem somewhat somber and simple, it is not until you read into the text that you come to understand the underlying statement that Soto is making. It makes one realize that the United States really does not uphold the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as it makes you think. It shows us that these rights are exclusively available to the group to which the government extends them. If you are not of white caucassien origin you simply have to fight for a chance, a chance to live, and a chance to feel the "privilege" of being successful. Read it one, two, or three times because each time you come to different realizations on what he is saying...$LABEL$1,0,-100
Worked fine -- until it didn't.. I had one of these for years, which worked fine until I was working on my handlebars, accidentally yanked the cord too much and it stopped working. The way this one works, there's a "base unit" that the computer slides into (a nice feature, so that you can have one base unit per bike, and switch the computer back and forth, allowing you to record "bike 1" and "bike 2" with one computer). So decided to just get a spare "base unit". Unfortunately, that never really worked. Bought another whole system, and that didn't work, either. So now I have two of them, both of which only function as a clock. Kind of disappointing, because I really did like the first one I had.$LABEL$0,0,-100

HORRIBLE. As a former Bela Karolyi protegee I have to say this is the worst book that I have ever read!!!! Joan Ryan has NO right to write a book about elite gymnasts when she has never been one herself. When I was w/ Karolyi it was never ANYTHING like what she says. What ya'll don't know is that Bela's smile and encouragment continue when the camera's not on him. I think that Ryan has a very sorry way of making a living!! I was an elite and I guarantee u that I and Dominique Moceanu, Kerri Strug, Kim Zmeskal, Jaycie Phelps, Shannon Miller etc... are in it 4 the fun. Bela, Mary Lee Tracy, Steve Nunno, The Rybacki's and every other coach who has an elite gymnast cares very much about there gymnasts. If they didn't they wouldn't have any elite gymnasts.

If you don't know to go to the dentist, not to wear sweatpants in public (see Seinfeld episode), and not let your hair grow down your neck, then buy this book. Other facts, such as good places to meet women, i.e., bookstores, coffee shops, are common knowledge.

Bottom line, I don't have "game," and if you don't have that you aren't going to meet womeon. This book helps you in the conversation department.

Excellent. I love 2 Unlimited. I had no knowledge of them during the 90s, they were not on Chicago radio. Chgo radio had good dance/trance/rave on B96 until 1993 or so, then for some reason, they stopped playing. Not until 1998, a college radio station featured hot dance music, which morphed into Energy radio in 2001...then they went off the air! Arrghh!!I found 2Unlimited through Amazon, featured on the Jock Jams collections.

Very unappealing. In reading customer reviews after I bought this, I was intrigued with the review that referred to the book as showing "interior design as art." Aha! Now I know why I found this book so unappealing. The book doesn't seem to be about decorating real homes for real life and real comfort. The book comes off as one author's idea of how to impress other people. These "settings" (I can't honestly call them homes because they are so chilly and phony looking) may work as backdrops for a cocktail party, but I keep wondering as I look at these pictures where the people who have to live in them actually go when they want to relax after the party's over.

Caused my 15 year old to hallucinate. My son is fifteen years old and was taking Mucinex DM Max Strength to help with bronchitis as he runs track and had a track meet coming up. He is 5'11" and weighs 160 lbs. So, the doctor gave him antibiotics and he was to take Mucinex DM as well as an inhaler for five days. By the third day my son's school called and informed me that he was hallucinating and weak. He also hadn't eaten anything that day and his blood pressure was 180/100. We immediately brought him to the emergency room to get him checked. He has not taken the Mucinex in over 48 hours now and is just starting to feel better (less high). I took him off Mucinex immediately but didn't realize that it could cause hallucinations. I never would have given it to him. So, I am glad that others reported this and I will never, ever buy that product again. I thank God because it could have turned out worse than it did.$LABEL$0,0,-100
It Should Have Been Better. Just watched the movie; was a big fan of Saints I. It pains me to say that while it's watchable, it's ultimately cartoonish and overdone. The brothers' relationship is taken for granted, and they are moved through obligatory gunplay like pieces on a board. The humor between them and their Mexican sidekick is phony and overdone, and his character is never clear. And Peter Fonda's accent sucks. He obviously didn't take much time preparing for his role, as limited as it was. Don't get me wrong -- the movie wasn't terrible, but it could -- and should -- have been so much better. I watch the original every so often. I don't think I'll watch this one again.$LABEL$0,0,-100
