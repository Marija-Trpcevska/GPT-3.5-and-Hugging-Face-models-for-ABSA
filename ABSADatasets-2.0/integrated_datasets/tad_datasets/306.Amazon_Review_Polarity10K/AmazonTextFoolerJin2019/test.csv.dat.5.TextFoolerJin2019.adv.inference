Putrid with barometric.. Until recently, "Sphere" was my favorite book. I read it in the mid-90s, when I was a teenager, and was ecstatic when I saw they were making a movie. Sure, the movie's sluggish as heck, but the atmosphere is admirable. I don't know what it is about this movies.

Top 100 novels? Seriously?. I read one novel by John Le Carre before: Our Kind of Traitor, which was awfully disappointing. Th Spy, on the other hand, has been included in the list of top 100 novels of the century by Time. I picked it up.The cranking of the novel is gripping, the plot develops unpredictably. Even, from the middle of the book it just exacerbate into peron, "good British spies against bad communists". I wish the author spent time studying East German justice system, to at least get the terminology right. It's a spoiler, but at the end of the novel the German intelloigence officer walks into a prison full of political detainees, opens the door with his own keys and lets the character - detained by the communist state - out into the street, where another escapee is waiting for her...Thhis novel is good to read in the dentist's waiting room.

Buyers Heed !!!. First the positive. John Brown's commentary on First Peter is a classic and should be a part of every Christian's library if they are serious about studying the bible. For the commentary in and of itself, I give a 5-star review.Why the negative? Because the ad as given is only for half of the commentary set!! Brown's commentary was originally published in three volumes. Sovereign Grace Publishers re-published this in a two volume set (volume one containing the original volume 1 and half of volume 2, and volume two containing the original volume's rest of volume 2 and volume 3). Therefore when purchasing this book, you are only getting half of the full original commentary set! That's a pretty hefty price for half a commentary.$LABEL$0,1,1
Hairmetal concluded allright. Twisted Sister is one of the very few hairmetal bands that have talent and arent cliche. Aii thinks that just because Bon Jovi, Warrant, and Poison blows that so will TS...WRONG! TS is a decent band to say the least, and Dee Snider will murder Bon Jovi with his pinky! Everyones heard 'We're not Gonna Take it' and 'I wanna Rock!' before, but those arent TS's only good songs. Anyway, the instrumental section of Sister is good as well and makes Bon Jovi look like road kill (well, they are road kill). This is good hairmetal, so get TS, Van Halens 1984, and something by Motley Crue where Vince Niel isn't there (I hate Vince Niel...).$LABEL$1,1,0

Justin Warfield is the bombarded. From Ivy league west coast liberal tree hugging rapping B-baller to flowing prose on Projectile the Bass to goth-punk retro revivalist, Justin Warfield has covered multiple genres with varying success.

I think if you can get past your pretensions and just see the album on simply its merits, you would see far least 1 star reviews. As a fan of Justin's sparse catalog, I found it odd for him to choose this genre. However, I still enjoy listening to it and tried to explain to my friends the other day that the band should have been called the 'Peter Murphies' or something like that. It doesn't mean it isnt good music. It means that I appreciate it on the level with better groups in this genre.It is repetitive. It is dreary.

He creates the perfect mood and will make you feel trapped just like the characters.Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee were awesome in their roles.And the score by John Carpenter was very chillingThe Halloween DVD is loaded with must see extras$LABEL$1,1,0

Sleeping with Dan.... A while ago I was given Danu Chadburn's CD, Seul Piano as a gift and had determines it aside until recently. While I was down with the flu, I went pursuing for some peaceable music to help me dodo. I found Mr. Chadburn's CD and imagines it sounded like a perfect choice - and It was! It not only forthwith ushered me into dispassionate dreams but (having my player set on continuous play) was there to welcome me awake with inspiration, energy and HEALTH! I'm no Doctor, but I figured if sleeping with Dan Chadburn helped me get well, what would living with him do for me? Ok, I'm being silly here...but I really am a HUGE fan now!

Excellent solitude. I bought this album on the strength of reviews I'd read, without ever having heard a note of Coyote Oldman's music. Big mistake. This is the kind of "ambient" music where one sustained note makes up a whole track. I listened to it all the way through and asked myself, "HUH? So where's the concerts?" This album may be good noise to cure insomnia or to produce a meditative stupor, but I'm appalled that anyone considers it to be music. I guess anything that comes out of a musical instrument can be called "music" if you're seriously determined to find favor with the products of primitive cultures.

Yearning not decided up digital cable. While the specs reflect it can receive digital cable, it does not. This is the 800e model - it picks up HD digital TV over the antenna, but can only receive analog cable through the coax input cable. Since most cable providers are going digital, very few analog stations will be accessible through cable with this device. Unfortunately, it is a goods whose time has taking. Whether all you need is to pick up the over-the-air HD signals, then this product should work fine for you. If you need to receive digital channels through your cable, you will need the 801e model.

Neat idea, vulnerable engineer.. This filter does not prime itself without a lot of help from you. Lots of air gets trapped in the intake tube and is a real headache to clear this and get any kind of water flowthrough the filter. The bio-wheel does not spin very easily and needs a lot of water to spin it, which this filter fails to provide. So the wheel usually just sits there. I've owned larger versions of this filter in the past, and had the same problems. They require a ton of fiddling-with after a water change, power outage, etc to get them going correctly.

I also would have been put off by the vinyl handle, and would not have bought this but for the previous review. Fully agreed, the handle is joyless and does not spectacle to want to fail. I also see that the bucket doesn't have the failing of other collapsible buckets, which want to fall to the side if the handle is not supported.

Terribly Intresting Lira. The events of 9/11 were devestating, this book doesn't try to refute those facts. This book does, however, bring forth several ideas backed with enough logical evidence that makes a person contemplating twice about what was really going on that day and how the government used the event as leverage to forge war. A few of the ideas mentioned in this book are; the 767 hitting the pentagon, yet no piece of the plane was ever recovered (the first time in history there's been no recovery of ANY piece of a plane after crashing on american soil), the mysterious stock-dumping of the airline companies affected on 9/11, and a very intresting piece on the heroin trade in afghanistan as being the main reason to forge war. As an American, I'd stand behind this book 100% with what's presented, it's obvious there's more going on than meets the eye.$LABEL$1,1,0

Dr. Fulton writes from experience, having been born with acne as a newborn and having suffered with it his whole life.This book is not meant to cure acne. However, it does offer a basic regimen for treating it at home. I recommend this book to any person in the dermatology or esthetic field.

In fact for the first third of the book, I believe it mentions other CRM products more often than Sugar.If you are actually trying to implement SugarCRM and expect this book to show you how to change a single setting to customize it your way, you will be sorely disappointed. There are vague references to things like "use the admin panel to change user permissions" but nothing more detailed than that simple phrase - and very little of that.$LABEL$0,1,1

grand for casual use. We use this to take occasional pithy home videos. The camera is easy to use and has large features. The 25x optical zoom is a must ont. I really like how the display rotates so I can see the picture while recording myself.The only disadvantages are that a docking station is required and repeatedly I have to wiggle the videotape on the docking station to get the charger tying to connect. The power connector and usb connections should be built into the oneness.$LABEL$1,1,0

Important Frustration. I bought this phone in 2007 for work purposes as I endeavors from homepage with a separate lines. The DECT 6.0 was a big influence on my purchase decision. My largest complaint is that it does not arrange a charge at all. This is not just annoying but embarrass as I use it for work. It used to enabling a warning beep at least when the battery was running lower but now just cuts off. me now can closely operate it for 1/2 hours at a time. It doesn't make me look professional to say the least. Any attempted use of speakerphone results in sudden death. The sound quality is not great and I have actually had interference from another person's call on the line once (I am also using Vonage for this line so I'm not sure if that's the phone's fault?! I thought that's what DECT was for though). I've ordered the replacement battery and if that doesn't sort it out will be replacing it but I'm not impressed with vtech based on this. Sounds like a known fault with this phone and I hate waste!$LABEL$0,1,1
