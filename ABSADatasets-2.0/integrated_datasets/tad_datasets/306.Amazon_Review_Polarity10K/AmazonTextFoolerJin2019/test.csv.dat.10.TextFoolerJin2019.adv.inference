Saves your financials. I was disgruntled in this book. Nowhere does it tell how to actually do this Rapid Eye Technology. It just tells you to buy her videos or to see a "technician." I'm giving it two stars instead of just one because the author sounds like a genuinely good person. She describes how she fasted and prayed and asked God to give her a technique that would help people. She also includes several chapters on what she calls life skills. But overall, when I buy a book, I expect to learn something I can actually apply, not just a sales pitch.$LABEL$0,1,1

Advisable. 12 Stones is a good small band. They haven't been together very long so some of the songs on their first song are similar in sound. They are great band, and I am disappointed that they got no recognition from the collaboration they did with Evanescene. Since they've haven't been together too long and signed a record contract shortly after you can guarantee that their next CD will be 5/5, they will have more time to record and will definetly sound amazing.Support this small band help'em make it big they deserve it!

What you would expect. This book was fluently accurate and practically worth the time I took reading it. Preaching from a single-minded point of view, the author professes to understand a culture and institution where she is an outsider. Having experienced The Citadel experience first hand, I can assure you it is one that is not easily explained to the outsider. Perhaps I am being a bit harsh, but quite a few of the points made in this book reflect upon a mind set that I can not comprehend. Read for yourselves, but I also implore you to keep an open mind about a school that has produced some of the finest patriots of the United States.$LABEL$0,1,1
Gerber's fruits are cooked. I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, brainchild that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to IG and she announced me that those posse fruits are all cooked! And there are additions to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies; when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?$LABEL$0,1,1
The Excitement Fades Fast. We buy this on the intensity of one TV episode (the first 20 minutes of the DVD) . Believing it all the method through, this is by far the minor Wiggles BLURAY of the eight we belong. We just logged in to Amazon anticipates to refer poor reviews for 'Feel Like Dancing' and are satisfactorily surprised by the superior rating and rave review. Conservation for a few of the singer, this DVD is terribly boring. We're not confident why the Wiggles, or many of the reviewers, feel that children will feel compelled to dance to ballet, the waltz, and slow square dancing.

Well-researched, but, dull, dull, dull. I lira a multiple of true-crime annals. Exquisite Whack Perfect Town was a sumptuous consternation.

Confident To Beat Jedi Outcast. This betting looks admittedly icebox. Knights of the Outdated Republic picking place 4,000 seniors before the first Star Wars film, in the middle of a war between the Jedi and the Sith. You have a strictly customizable character, and you uniformly have an older sibling of the opposite gender who is a skilled Jedi Knight. Eventually you will become one, too. But before that, it's you and whatever blasters you may find or pick up. Also, you can make a group that can consist of Wookiees, Jedi, droids, Twi'Leks, or whatever is present and strikes your fancy. You'll travel to many worlds in your ship, the Ebon Hawk, very similar to the Millenium Falcon. En route, however you'll face Sith fighters. This game looks very exciting.$LABEL$1,1,0

Great music, but too many medleys. Tom Fettke's Majesty and Glory contains some wonderful music, but in doing so many medleys it leaves the listener 'hanging' wanting to hear the rest of the verses of the hymns.

Most of it is garbage that makes you want to gnash your teeth at the enormous errors being made.This pound however puts the movement on a solid footing and is glamorous throughout.I took one star off because every other chapter appears to have been written by Judith Hughes.

Finally, someone who can think clearly.I have no idea why this book has been so overlooked.

I asked to see exactly how the move was being done but received to concoct and hope I was doing it right. Yes, she is very nice but it would have been better to watch the entire move. Then, some moves were only done once or in one set as soon as I was getting it. It was a little inconvenient to stop the tape and practice. Other than that, it is a great workout which is fun. The negatives don't detract too much from the overall tape. I look forward to doing the workout each day and do feel I get better each time I do it. I even work up a sweat!

NOVA: Secrets of the Samurai Sword. A very outlandish documentary on the art and science involved in manufacturing a samurai sword. The journey begins with the selection of the metal and the viewer then follows craftsmen producing a sword using the same techniques as their ancestors. Interwoven are scenes with swordsmen demonstrating their skills on bamboo targets and a brief history of the samurai and historical use of these weapons. Modern science is used to explain the strength of the sword and the reason behind the shape of the blade. My only criticism is making the handles, which can be quite ornate, was not explored. The focus is on the blade.Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in martial arts and weaponry in particular.$LABEL$1,1,0

This is the one you want. This is the top one to buy right now for home users. Some important things to note.(1) Make sure you turn off the Microsoft Wireless Zero Configuration service. You do that in the Control Panel --> Services. Then you install the vendor-supplied wireless software, and you'll have no connection drops. This is important for Microsoft Zero Configuration Service is a piece of crap.(2) Make sure you use some sort of authentication for wireless, preferably WEP 128 combined with MAC Address Filtering.(3) After you get it up and running (reading the instructions) do a firmware upgrade and update your firmware to the latest version.Mine has been running for almost a year and I've never had a single problem.$LABEL$1,1,0

Another version of Cole Porter's layout..... After the Cole Porter movie came out a few years ago (ie: the movie with Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd), there was a resurgence in interest in Cole Porter's hits.This CD has most of Cole's hits from the movie, although the songs are not sung by modern singers (as in the recent De-LOVELY movie). Thus, the songs in this Cd were scratched before the movie.Please note that the earlier recordings included in this CD will not sound as "sharp" as the movie version tracks (ie: the soundtrack's songs to the movie which is called "De-Lovely"). However, if you can afford to buy both versions (ie: this CD and the De-Lovely CD) I think you will be able to get a nice "feel" for Cole Porter.A nice addition to your music history CD Library,in my opinion.$LABEL$1,1,0

You can't argue with Early Church Fathers. Webster takes on a very textbook style in writing his book. He quotes directly from Early Church Fathers who did not believe in the Primacy of the Bishop of Rome or the Papacy of Peter. Although it is not the particular subject matter, it explains well how the Catholic Universal Church evolved into a Dictorial Roman religion packed full of pagan and gnostic theologies.In conclusion, the arguement brought up in Webster's book cannot be ignored, and prominent Roman Catholic Apologists cannot refute the claims made in this book.$LABEL$1,1,0

Asset!!??!!. Just so you know: the Oxford World Classics edition of LA REINE MARGOT is abridged. Oxford "justifies" the abridged version by saying it's the best known, but I think if MARGOT were as popular as THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, Oxford would spend the extra money to give it to us in full. me understand things like Readers Digest condensing books for the masses, but shouldn't something as scholarly as Oxford World Classics give us the real thing? What about Dumas fans who want to read his stories they way he wrote them? Most Dumas readers aren't afraid of long books, especially if they've read MONTE CRISTO or VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE(which is almost TWICE as long as MONTE CRISTO). Unfortunately, the unabridged version seems only available in French. But I'm a biggish Dumas fan, so I read Oxford's abridged MARGOT rather than nothing. It's great, Great, GREAT, but a shadow hung over the entire book making wonder what I was missing. What Dumas-esque character moments did I miss? What details?$LABEL$0,1,1

Read Memories of a Catholic Girlhood instead. I love most of Mary McCarthy, but in my opinion, this is her fewer manoel. It covers basically the same territory as Memories of a Catholic Girlhood, which she wrote in the 1950s. Here, however, there's unassuming tracing of her signature, tightly-wrought style. Elsewhere, the style is baggy, with barbed sentences, chatty asides, digressions within digressions, and endless lists of books she read, names of friends, etc. As a result, I often lost track of the basic story - which, after all, was the exact same story she had already told in Memories of a Catholic Girlhood. I'm rather confused as to why McCarthy wrote this book at all. Given that she had already written a detailed memoir of her formative years, why not just skip ahead to the mid-1930s, the subject of her unfinished "Intellectual Memoirs"?$LABEL$0,1,1

one of the most industrious books I've ever read!. I am sure that after the great performance by Tom Hanks portraying Forrest Gump, everyone is dying to hear of a sequel to the movie. Gump & Co. brings that to the readers except Forrest's life does not match up to the life of Forrest from the movie. Forrest isn't having the best time of his life and he needs to survive all the hardships being thrown to him. Reading the book is suppose to give you the sense of reading the continuation of his life. The past references that Forrest makes in the book are not equivalent to the movie itself. In the movie for example, his long time sweetheart Jenny was buried under "their tree" in Forrest's backyard. In the book, I really wanted to put the book down. Some parts just didn't make sense. The movie and the novel were two entirely different things. I highly do not recommend this book if you are interested in reading a sequel to Forrest Gump. Just wait for the actual movie sequel.$LABEL$0,1,1

Anything effort was made to find better film elements, the extras are unlucky (they would've been fine as part of a larger collection of extras) and "Duck Soup", one of the top 100 American Films of all time, doesn't even merit a commentary track!Compare this shoddy work with MGM's labor of love from earlier this year on "A Night at the Opera" and "A Day at the Races", and Universal's effort looks darned poor.Universal needs to hear from Marx Brothers fans, too. The Brothers deserve better and so do we.$LABEL$0,1,1
ehhhhh. me was REEEEALLY excited when I received my copy of this album. I took it to my car and started listening with the system blasting. I find myself columnist "next track" more than loving the music.It's definitely unique. Some of the songs are REEEALLY advisable, but the rest make up for it. Ugglor|Mossen might be one of the best songs I've ever heard. The stayed of the cds can't compete though. The reason this album earned 2 stars is because this song is on it.I've reviewed a number of cds and box sets... if it's great GOA you're looking for you get you movin and groovin, go other places. It may be a great album for some of you looking for a unique sound that unmatchable (like I thought it would be), but I can't say I'm satisfied.$LABEL$0,1,1

Outflow of the Race. TWICE SHY by Dick Francis is an off day at the track. Jonathan Derry is a nice enough young physicist who acquires some musical tapes, which are in reality a fancy computerized betting system. But in the world of computers a hiatus of fourteen years doesn't work and neither does the change in narrators.Add TWICE SHY to your collection by all means, but try WILD HORSES for a trip into the power of Dick Francis.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS.$LABEL$0,1,1
Just alright.... The game has correctly good cartoonish graphics for the time it was made. The voice acting is clique but serves its purpose for the game style. Plenty of war materials to get anyone happy. The biggest issue is the controls. They are hard to get use to and some what clumsy. It didn't feel natural to move and conduct basic movements and commands. If a while I got tired of it and simply introduces the game down. I don't any intention of ever playing it again. Just not worth the time.$LABEL$0,1,1
Statin levels. Based on what I have researched/read each pill in this formula should contain 3.4mg ofLovastatins, (Icluding monacolins KA form).The FDA will not allow these companies to print this on the label. They want everyone reliant on large pharma. This formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin (thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the Balkans where this toxin is found in high levels) a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trials.I would also recommend taking a CoQ10 supplement like Q-gel which is solubilized in polysorbate 80, for excellent absorption.$LABEL$1,1,0
Isn't comedy supposed to be funny?. If you lined up all of the humourous material on the 2 CD's, you'd laugh for 5 minutes. But those 5 minutes would be F**king hysterical. Lighthearted in places but perfectly dilutes.$LABEL$0,1,1
A bit thin and oriented to the big end of the scale. What I didn't realise when I ordered this is that it is an publication of a US kennel association. It is a slim book, gives a good, realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective, and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like "is the kennel business for me?" and "what are the main issues in kennel management?" Its orientation is toward large kennels (65+ dogs) in the US. For someone like me, who is thinking about a small kennel in Australia, it was interesting, but not really worth its pricetag.$LABEL$0,1,1
No mentions of diabetes?. Not to oversimplify, but if a guide to dwarf hamsters doesn't mention diabetes - a *huge* issue with the Campbells variety - then embrace it's inclement in other ways, too.$LABEL$0,1,1
