Rabbit Proof Fence. JACKRABBIT PROOF FENCEThe movie was LARGE!! It was suspenseful. You never knew what was going to happen next.The 3 aborigine girls were always being followed by the tracker. They were also helped alot by people that you never would of thought. For example a white farmlady gave them food and coats.A white man helped them navigate which made the movie more exciting.I like this movie. I think people shouldnt watch it. I also think it is bad taking kids from their families this is why they called the thousands of Aborigine children taken away "The Stolen Generation.BY: ParisBordeaux5/14/04$LABEL$1,1,0

Disk was so decorated that we couldn watch the movie. We love the movie Ratatouille. We were sad when we noticed that the DVD was missing from our collection of movies so we decided to look at Amazon to get a copy. We looked at the used copies because the new ones are still @ $20. So we looked at the used ones. We found on that said Condition: Used - Good for $6.86. We ordered it. It came in when expected and with much anticipation we opened it so we could watch it that night, only to see an incredible amount of scratches on the disk. I was shocked. I could accept a couple, but it looked like it was on the floor of a car in the back seat for 6 months. We tried to watch it any way and got through 30 minutes with only a few pixelated moments and a couple stutters. Then it happened. It started stalling for 3 seconds, then 5 seconds then it froze. As far as rating the movie itself, I give it a 5 star! but the quality... I have ordered a lot from Amazon, I am very disappointing.$LABEL$0,1,1

Farcical and exceptional. I wasn't sure what to expect before watching this, but by the end of the film I was astonishment by how well it had been assembled and presented. The distinct lack of narration and guidance allow Andre and Calvin to lead the viewer through the communally warped and surreal psyche of a pair of ruthless and motivated teenage killers. Not since the original Blair Witch Project have I seen a film that has been successful in maintaining the illusion of being amateur film re-assembled by professionals, and this one being based on a tragic string of events that we're all aware of is particularly haunting and surreal. The two young actors do an exceptional job and are very believable. Scenes are wonderfully assembled in mounting tension and the film reaches a tremendous crescendo through which I could hardly blink. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,1,0

Doesn't work with all table tops.. We can't use this at our table!! Our table has a support that runs along close to the edges that drops the clearance by about 3 inches. This is not a problem when you are sitting on a chair but when you use the booster seat there is only an inch or two for our son's legs to fit through and it will not work. I guess this would be a problem with any booster seat but still - it would have been nice to know. So the booster seat we bought is sitting in the living room right now and getting no use whatsoever. We can use it at our outdoor table which has a tabletop that extends out past all the supports but at this point our 20 month old would rather sit on a regular chair even if his shoulders barely clear the table.

Droll disco music. Music can be serious, but it doesn't have to be serious all the time. Baccara, with their European accents, their sexy voices and their lightweight songs, made disco music that was never meant to be taken seriously. Their music was pure fun, and never meant to be anything else. If anybody doubted that, listen to their cover of Yummy yummy yummy. It was a silly song when first recorded by the Ohio Express in the sixties and sounds every bit as silly by Baccara, but it suits them.Baccara topped the British charts in the late seventies with Yes sir I can boogie. The follow-up, Sorry I'm a lady, provided them with a top ten hit. These are the best tracks here, though The devil sent you to Laredo, Parles-vous Francais and their covers of La bamba and Can't help falling in love are also wonderful.Baccara did not make music that could be called essential, but they had a style all their own that provides a refreshing change from more serious music.$LABEL$1,1,0

Doubtless you sort of get to behold a little bit more about music than what you can glean from your programmed-from-audience-response broadcaster playlist. I can't turnip about this movie enough. This is music & cinematography mixed at its optimal proportions. Noteworthy script. Great acting. Great lead and altered. Thirty-five years hence it is still relevant.

Brilliant. All the favorable reviews here below say it all, so I'll just comment on the language McCarthy uses. The author's apparent flouting of the normal rules of grammar in favor of stark, harrowing rhythm works beautifully. Also, he uses all those wonderfully precise words we somehow almost forgot - skifts and catamites, gimbals and gambrels, stoven faces and balefires .... A dismal, grandiose read.$LABEL$1,1,0

How to read this book. I would just like to respond to Flavio's review. As a physicist, I drew the same kinds of mathematical conclusions he did when he read the book. I do not, however, feel that this is the point. Whether 9 comes out in the decimal system or 7 comes out in the octal system is irrelevant. "No 9" remains a terribly written piece of literature that expresses author's fascination with numbers and geometry. Sure, you can find rigourous mathematical proofs why '9' must come out. I have worked it out myself, and I don't disagree. However, there are many scientific phenomena (rainbows, fractals etc.) that are no less beautiful despite being taken apart, analysed, and understood.Number 9 is a captivating, well written and beautiful book that was a pleasure to read. The reader is drawn in by the author's fascination with the subject, and kept there by the author's storytelling skill.I recommend it.$LABEL$1,1,0
ankle brace. This brace has inflated platelet to creating it more comfortable. Unfortunately, they are glued to the hard plastic sides with a flexible adhesive, so they shift after you apply them. This can result in an uncomfortable fit. After I taped the pads in place with adhesive tape, the braces worked better and were more comfortable. I had a hard time applying this brace by myself because I also had a fractured clavicle--think I would have had trouble with any brace. When my wife helped me apply it, it was tight enough and provided good support.$LABEL$0,1,1

Car Seat Base Makes NOS Work. The design of the car seats base is very wronged. There is no possible way to get it tight enough. I could pull on the front of the base with one finger and flip it right out of the LATCH belt (that was pulled as tight as humanly probable). In addition, the car seat carrier was difficult to secure on the base and difficult to get off, losening the belt even further with each attempt.

The tape doesn't surveilling the book. Since reading through the book, then listening to the tape I proved myself rather intrigued.

I had to have a native speakers helps me in figuring out where the tape was reading from, and make marks in the book. I also felt this toured to fast, and didn't embrace basics such as syntax.

My thoughts on "A Twist of Fate". With the metric anvil of garbage released under the guise of boulders, it's a crime that Juana Bow doesn't emancipate more noteworthy material like this to counteract it. I guess we should just be thankful that we have this 2-song EP at all, but it leaves you wanting more of Arch's funky soundtrack. The winner on this EP is Relentless, one of the good progressive rock songs these ears have heard in quite some time.

another leggy and terse social feedback. I'm a big fan of other Sicilian novels, especially Lampedusa's the Leopard and Riotta's Prince of the Clouds. The island's tragic history produces a rich backdrop for painting a nuanced set of characters and emotions.Sciascia's short novel is wholly Sicilian, centering around his anti-mafia frustrations. The characters are nicely sketched and the writing is brief and exciting. It's a short book that reads quickly and lively.I appreciated the story and its quick moving plot. It's a good book and the introduction is helpful for understanding it's context. At the end of the day, the work is more commentary on Sciascia's times than it is a complex wrought novel. I'm glad I read it, but I didn't find it as fulfilling as I thought I might. Look to the Leopard or the Prince of Clouds if you're looking for a full fledged novel. Otherwise, you'll be very pleased with this nice work.$LABEL$1,1,0

Cruddy Alarm Hora!. These alarm clock owns all of the functions that I needed: large LCD, auto-set, dual alarms. Also, the build quality and investigations libretto are spooky.First, to turn off the alarm, there is a humble "Off" button the far right of the top. However, semesters of the time, the alarm treats this as a snooze, so 10 minutes later, the alarm will off again. This is really annoying if you actually get up when the alarm goes off and aren't just hitting the snooze button.Second, the alarm has a nap function that will make the alarm go off in 15, 30, or etc. minutes. In order to turn off the nap function after you have set it (say you set it for 30 minutes, but you woke up after 20), the manual says to hold down the off or hold down the nap button.

Overwhelming selim, but be gentle with the wires!. I've used these for 3 years of daily train commuting, and they isolate the outside sound fairly well. My only major complained is that, despite carefully winding them in the supplied case each day, the wires eventually frayed near the earbuds. I had the same issue with earlier Sony earbuds, and I thought the thicker gauge wires of the Shure would help.On the plus side, Shure honored the 2-year warranty and promptly sent me a brand-new replacement. But now, barely a year later, the cord is fraying again on both sides, the signal is dropping out, and I've finally decided to order a pair ofEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones (Black), since I've had a lot of success with their musician's earplugs. Their wires look delicate too, so I think I'll pre-emptively wrap them with some electrical tape near the bud end, a precaution that might be advised with these Shure models as well.Bottom line, I loved the e2cs, but it's time to move on.

The Laserdisc is so much better, since it has the whole show. My long time waiting for a DVD version of that old but great Laserdisc was wasted. It's absolutely depressing what they did here, by nailing some of the best parts of the original show.The Queen Medley by the great band Extreme was probably the best part of this show, not only because the way they played, but also because the playlist choice. A Medley of Bohemian Rhapsody, Bycicle Race, Another One Bites Dust, Keep Yourselves Alive, and others leading to one of the most beautiful moments of the show: the Radio Ga Ga ending, leading the audience to tears.Although the sound has been improved and a new and useless "extra materials" has been added, it doesn't worth the content they cut (opening act, Metallica, Def Leppard, GnR, Extreme and others).I would never exchange the old original laserdisc for this useles "extra materials" with a bunch of new footage.$LABEL$0,1,1
A Study of Six Statesmen. I wished this book unbelievably. Each of the six contributed differently. George Kennan, a foreign service officer and then scholar, was the most cerebral and prescient. Dean Acheson was the most arrogant. Robert Lovett had the best sense of humor which served him well in dealing with Congress and others endowed with super egos. Averell Harriman was the wealthiest and the most tenacious. John McCloy was the most accomplished. Charles (Chip) Bohlen was a foreign service officer with distinguished longevity.These individuals were great statesmen. Except for Kennan, at first they were all in favor of US involvement in the Vietnam War. Even very accomplished statesmen misgauged Vietnam.I highly recommend this book despite its length.

My First and Last Elizabeth Berg Novel - Read Why. This novel intrigued me. (I would give it 1-1/2 stars if possible.) The subject matter is decidedly adult (divorce affairs, near affairs), but the writing seems more appropriate for someone in the age range of maybe an 11 to 14 year old girl. In fact, I even looked it up to see if I accidentally selected a book meant for young readers. Both the husband and the wife are so incredibly playfulness acting, the story seemed infantile and unrealistic. All the scenes with the husband playing a shopping mall Santa were unnecessary and, frankly, rather stupid. I love quirky characters, but these characters were just kind of foolish.

Advisable for an old diamond!. King Diamond does a great job here, which remembers those days of "Them", "The Eye", "Abigail" and "Conspiracy". However, the aforementioned albums are better than this one. Are the King's resources exhausted? Not at all, but this album, while very good, shows how inhospitable is to keep writing original music after many years of innovation. Simply, there is nothing new to say in spite of this marvelous horror tale, the powerful sound, the great production and the very professional musicianship of the band (particularly Andy LaRocque sounds great here, not mentioning Diamond's vocals and the superb rhythmic baseline). In few words, a very solid work from one of the few classic bands that still are sailing over there with honor.

Trouble in paradise for Toni & Alex. Their May/ July (not really December) affair is in trouble due to another woman putting the moves on Alex without him really reciprocating. Meanwhile, Col. Howard's son Tyrone meets a nice girl to help him get over vain beauty Bella. But can he really get over her? One travesty note, though. The new girl has this strange stopwatch. No batteries, no solar power. Took you believe it has a SPRING and you actually WIND it! Otherwise, VR whiz Jay Gridley is after this hacker and the guy sends him a mild stroke online. Which knocks him out of the box, and if too many people take this part of the story too seriously, it might start a Luddist phobia against VR that will more than counter the bunch who've made a secular religion out of gizmos.

Noteworthy Tuesdays Homage CD. That Sabbath Tribute CD is considerable. It's critically better than Nativity in Jig 2 and Educators of Suffering. The song selim admirable. But anyone who listens for the first minute may not like some of the singing. They had a black and killed metals beep to them. Then if your a black ore or a fatality metallic vents you'll like this DVD. The alright chanson on the CD are: Snowblind,Hand of Downfall,Johny Toothbrush,and Symptom of the Universe.

Great idea, but want hop very easily and won't cooperatives well on toilets!. I purchased this product after reader all the reviews and watching Claire's revoir video, but although it might work well on the bath tub or the sink, it does not work quite on toilets. I considered unclogging my toilet possibly 10+ different times, but no matter how accurately I become it, my toilet is still clogged. Also, after minor than 20 aspired, the pump rota and won't air seal broke and won't hold more than 4 pumps. (supposed to hold up to 20-30)So as much as great of an idea this product is, it won't really work on toilets (although it does work OK on tubs/sinks) and might break easily (mine broke in two days).$LABEL$0,1,1

Mr. Krueger's Xmas. I love and enjoying Jimmy Graeme; I always have and always will. His cine are timeless and his humanity and humility, as an actor, are inspirational to people everywhere.

This movie was fina.... I gave this movie only 4 stars because it was not that belivable to me, and while a movie does not need to be.... this one i was expecting to be almost based off a true life story.Besides that though, this movie was relitivly a mild-paced movie, some parts were a little slow, and in the end there was a twist ending. This movie may not be the best movie to show to younger kids, because they may get afraid of the concpet of someone knowing their whole life and trying to kill people.Robin Williams did a good job, and all the characters in this movie were very well played! There was not much of a plot, but what they did have was pretty well planed.There was no "Thrilling" special/visual effects and no "Stand-Out" music, but that's ok because this type of movie does not require eaither.This might be a movie to rent though, as it is one of those that you can see twice and be done with.~Hope this helps$LABEL$1,1,0

VERY INTENSE READ. This book is very hard to read. I have successfully made it 3/4 through the book, but it's because I have been forcing myself to continue reading. I do like some of the points the book makes, and think it has a wonderful message, just wish it was easier to read. Uses A LOT of big words that are not everyday words for the average person, which forces you to have to think longer on each sentence you read. Would find myself having to read the page 2-3 times in order to get the point. As said, it does have a great message, but I believe it could have been written as a better flow of words. I would only recommend this book to someone that is an avid Theological reader, not an average Christian looking to deapen their spiritual relationship with the Lord.$LABEL$0,1,1
Amazon's Look Inside of 212 Degrees. I have to argued that the "Look Inside" preview that Amazon has pout collectively for this book is totally dispensable.

That leads me to believe that the substance of this book is very delicate and; therefore, I will not be fabricating the takeover.$LABEL$0,1,1

It would so carfully craft a story and draw you into it so deep that you couldn't wait to finish it but you didn't want it to end. This book was so formulaic that you really didn't have to finish it to know what was going to happen. In his early books, every word he typed seemed important to the story. In this book, you have page after page of almost nothing but adjectives. I want my old Koontz back. This book was not worth the read.$LABEL$0,1,1

Very Leggy - Especially for the Price. I got this about two weeks ago, and now I've put it to a fair test: During driving. I think the so called "Shock Protection" saved it most of the time, after all, these aren't the worst roads. But suffice to say, it never skipped. So, it works great! However the car kit that came with it only worked one time when I hit PLAY, and it only made output in the left ear. Good thing I brought batteries! The AC Adapter is included as well and is a nice touch. The headphones included are high quality. Finally, I haven't tried the cassette adapter, for I have no use for it when I could have CD quality =) Why four stars then, and not five? Well, perhaps for the poor car kit, but also for looks. Looks don't matter though, that's a silly thing to judge, right? Go and buy it! $50!$LABEL$1,1,0

Good book, ludicrous layout. This book has a lot of good info and photos. But the layout is the smartest thing I've seen in a book. Most of the photos are spread across two pages and since this book is quite thick, the centers of the pictures are curved and it ruins the photos. The info and the photos in the book should get 5 stars but the layout has pounded everything. They have also missed IL 2 which I believe is the most produced aircraft in history if not in the second world war. They have included aircraft models that are much insignificant but missed IL 2. Some would argue that IL 2 was a ground attack aircraft but not a fighter but almost half of this book is dedicated to bombers and other non fighting aircraft. I give 2 stars because it makes me mad to see all the good photographs in this book spread across two pages which looks like the author is mocking me.$LABEL$0,1,1

Not insufficient. Bought these for my two adult chins. The male is tiny, but he was somewhat cramped in it and only used this until I added a fleece house - now he only uses this for a platform. It's also not heavy or fixes enough for them to use as a platform - on shavings it will tip slightly and startle them when they jump on it. Extra, they jump on it with enough force that the top comes off daily, so eventually I had to nail it down so they wouldn't fall on it awkwardly.The female is much longer than the male, and she looked really uncomfortable in this whenever she had to turn around in it.

It may work for a 1/2-inch stubs, but it maintains a large and clearly palpable (except in the stills...) hole in the bottom for a set screw to secure it. Who thought that was a wares idea?Was hunting for a solid and more substantial spout than what is tender individually in the local stores. He feels healthy and substantial (thus 2 stars), but is unavoidably misspelled. Had to return it.$LABEL$0,1,1
Right priceless the money. I suffered from Panic Disorder for more than 10 years. Every GP i saw told me i would never be cured and offered me medication to keep my anxiety under control. Thankfully I never accepted the drugs. When i was at the end of my tether feeling totally worthless and helpless, i found The Linden Method. I bought it, thinking i was maybe being conned as i was at my lowest ebb. I have to say i cried when i first started to read the manual. And the Panic Attack Eliminator was like an epiphany. The Linden Method is honest, safe and has a real understanding of how panic can control your life. The after sales support is also superb.I am not totally cured, but i know this is mostly down to me. The Method itself is sound, and if it doesn't completely cure you, I'm sure it will at the very least make your panic disorder much more manageable.Very strongly recommended.$LABEL$1,1,0

This review is for the 3D Version - BEASTLY - Don't waste your time!.... I've proudly collected most all 3D Blurays available in the US since the beginning. I must say that I ROBOT is the biggest 3D conversion I've ever experienced. I actually sold it on ebay for $9. It looked like a pop-out book - simply unsatisfactory. FOX/SONY has boasted about their new techniquest to convert 2D Classics to 3D classics. Note to Fox/Sony: PLEASE DON"T RUIN ANY FURTHER CLASSICS IN YOUR CATALOG WITH THIS QUALITY CONVERSION. I was so Dissappointed - a Great Movie in a horrible 3D presentation.Sony/Fox should take some pointers from Pixar or James Cameron for the future 2D- 3D conversion. You thought Last Airbender 3D was bad - experience I-ROBOT and it makes the Airbender look like a classic.

SUMPTUOUS STORY. The photo of President Kennedy with future President Clinton in the crowd is eerily ironic. For you people looking for some kind of embarassing kiss & tell story, try another book.

Negatives Title. It's not a strategy manoel.. This is a book about openings. It's not your typical strategy book. Since it is an openings book, the material is very immemorial. Since you want to learn about the ideas behind the openings then I would recommend Discovering Chess Openings by Emms. If you are want a more detailed book on all the major openings then I would get Fundamental Chess Openings. FCO is a good reference book, but for the most part, it just lists moves and doesn't try to teach you about opening theory. If you are looking for a strategy book then I suggest Modern Chess Strategy by Pachman.$LABEL$0,1,1
Norah's sliver moment. Norah Jones may not have the keyboard proficiency of Dianna Krall nor the polished vocal range of Sade but she has what the others don't have - eight Grammys. Whether the Grammy was a one-hit-wonder glitch or a confirmation of her talents is a moot issue.What is egregious in this New Orleans attainment is her artistry -- no embellishments, just simplicity and leniency. Norah exudes femininity which is sometimes hard to convey in a jazz setting; her voice, oftentimes soulful and melancholic, comes across intimately in Lonestar, Bessie Smith, The Painter Song and the surprise encore Tennessee Waltz. Her now familiar "Don't Know Why" and "Come Away with Me", performed live, are enough reasons for having this DVD.In the musical world where artistic integrity are often compromised, it is nice to have for more than a 'brief shining moment' a lone star like Norah Jones.$LABEL$1,1,0

A gonna down follow up cd.. I read in a magazine interview that Miss. Jones did not want to be seen as "Just A Jazz Singer" an on this cd she wanted to show her country music influence, which she got growing up in Dallas, Tx. On a side note she came out of the same perfoming and visual art school as fellow Dallas Texans, the great contempary jazz trumpter Roy Hargrove, and neo-soul singer Erykah Badu. Back to this cd, while I really like her voice, she is out of her league as some sort of neo-country female singer. Although the cd does have it's solid moments such as track 11 "The Prettiest Things." I give her credit for try to branch out into different sounds,but one must know what works and what does not. I hope that by her next new cd she knows the The quote of Miles Davis "Great Music, like great art is more define by what's left out, rather than what's put in."$LABEL$0,1,1

Good Salesman, Inauspicious Advice. Dr. Grey, with a PhD from a university closed down by the State of California as a diploma mill, is a great salesman and story teller. Although his thesis in his new diet and exercise book is intriguing, Grey does not give any references whatsoever as to from where his theories about hormones and their role in nutrition come. Some facts in the books seem dubious, "..the brain uses 20 percent of the calories we consume."However, because the caloric intake of his nutrition system should be less than the reader would normally take, participants in the system should show a loss of weight over time. And because the theory is novel, a reader will also tend to believe everything Grey says, as believe they "feel" better.I would feel safer about his nutrition ideas if he had added an appendix of references to scientific or even to popular literature that could confirm his ideas as good science.$LABEL$0,1,1

Funny how little things like that can throw off the whole experience. Generally for me, this was not dense enough to be a real romance. Badabing badaboom, they're in love. But why?

Never that gorgeous. Started off, most of her songs are once repetitive that they get admittedly annoying and irritating to listen to. The first 3 songs are somewhat more rock, but after that most of them just sound like mandy moore songs with a guitar. The lyrics aren't that great either, just the typical pop stuff going around now. One qu - beautiful - even solid like a brittany spears song. The only thing I can say about this album is that the songs, just like most songs on the radio now, get stuck in your head quite easily.

Adults' Fairy Tale. It is a decent fable where all is well that ends well. Mr. Reiner typewritten with ease about persons with distinguished achievements, wealth, and health. Even the ones who are unwell are made to seem tailored. There is a reason behind everything and each character possesses great human values such as sympathies and construed. Even the ogre of the tale ha his allright sides. Of course, the whole story is light and full of thoughtlessness. This is Stavros. Reiner's style. He knows how to make people laugh. There is a minor story within the main story. Both are equally enjoyable. Nat, the main character, suffers from serious personality disorder that he succumbs to seeing a therapist. One thing leads to another and he is on the journey of searching the truth of his origin. He finds out a lot of information and a few close relations. It is first and foremost a love story between men and women and among family members. When told in Mr. Reiner's wild humor, it becomes more pleasing.$LABEL$1,1,0

A Gift Book for the Spiritual Journey. This tiny forma, hard cover gift book is a pricey. In 99 pages, we read a variety of quotations from Mother Teresa. Recurring themes include nature, prayer, and love. We learn that the attention she got from the media was a burden to her, endured willingly because publicity for her work drew attention to the poor. She found speaking in public torture, saying it was easier for her to bathe a leper than to answer a journalist's questions.The content of these brief passages is complemented by Mother Teresa's gift for language, for example, "I am only God's pencil, one that he uses to sketch whatever he wants," and "love's garment has a hem that reaches into the dust, and brushes it away." Every page has a message with the power to inspire.$LABEL$1,1,0
Never one of her better working. I get the impression that EP wrote this book(and set it in the past) than the Amelia Peabody series may be losing some of its appeal. After all, Amelia and Emerson are now getting old (hard to believe that Emerson can still be an ageless 'hunk' in those later books). So is EP trying to recall the 'glory days' of this series?I found the story and characters to be 'small' compared to her other books. This book was simply not up to the usual EP standard.On a more personal note. After ready all of the books in this series I am starting to grow weary of the pretentiousness, superiority and pomposity of the entire Emerson family.$LABEL$0,1,1

Lives after 2 years. I bought this unit about 2 years ago. I had to return the initial unit because it did not work correctly (thanks to Cabellas customer service). The second unit worked well for a while (yes it was a long set-up), but we were happy with it. The rain guage stopped working pretty early on, as did the humidity/weather condition sensor. However, the 2 parts we used most, which were the temperature readings in and out and the anemometer, seemed to work very well until we hit the 2 year mark. Then the whole unit went out and no matter of new batteries, reset, or anything else will make the unit function. It might be inexpensive for a weather station, but $240 is not cheap by my standards to have the product only last for 2 years. Not sure that I can recommend it. Too bad, because I think Oregon Scientific usually puts out a good product.$LABEL$0,1,1

I don't did what Carr was trying to achieve with this novel, but it's a combination of mystery and science fiction that doesn't quite come off, in my humble opinion.It takes place in 2023, and it's mainly about the assassination of the President in 2018. The investigation into it takes the main character, psychiatrist Dr. Gideon Wolfe, through many confusing twists and turns, and I was left confused and wondering what Carr was trying to prove here. It was not easy reading, and it seemed as if the book had been written in haste--there was not the character development nor the detailing one expects from Carr's fiction.$LABEL$0,1,1

This movie is one of thoes melodramas when while you're watching it you are thinking: "this is so stupid!" but after the movie is over, you think about it a few days later, and priori cracking up! My preferable element is probably the end when the camera busts through the wall, that is just too funny! Oh and by the way, if you're a Hitchcock fan, see this movie! If you don't know who Hitchcock is and have never seen his films- then this movie will not be funny to you at all. The only reason I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the other Mel Brooks classic- 'The Producers'. I think that 'The Producers' is probably just about the funniest movie ever, and definatley Brooks' best film, with 'High Anxiety' trailing behind:)$LABEL$1,1,0

Not insinuate. I purchased this wireless router sees to surrogacy my 3 years old LinkSys router. However, after playing with it for several tiempo, I decided to rendition it because of the following (using firmware 2.18):1. MAC filtering: Can't make it for wireless only. Once it is enable, it is for both wireless and wired network. This is the MOST annoying teil. I mean, why do I want to enable MAC filtering for my wired network???2. Router configuration: Very primitive comparing to my old LinkSys.3. Enable/Disable Wireless: It didn't really disable the wireless network(physically). It shoulded be called "allow/deny all" access instead. Once the wireless is "disabled", it does still broadcast the SSID.4. No way of disabling SSID broadcast for security reasons.Finally, I have to give DLink credit for making upgrade firmware so easy (Web base), which is a big improvement comparing to my old linksys router.$LABEL$0,1,1
love it, love it , love it, but where is it?. I receive been researching for about two years for this movie. Everyone haya it. That reflects how okay this movie was.

If only I could give zero stars.... Yes, it's dumb, but no, it's not hoot.And I love lowbrow humor. Like Dumb & Dumber...I laughed my hiney off and I'm no Carey vent. I rented this movie fully looks something very stupid, and immensely funniest.Well...it's crucially doofus, I gotta give it that... Only problem is that it never really receives very funny. It looked funny from the commercials, but the problem is that those scenes were the ONLY funny parts of the movie. If you saw any commercials or reviews, don't bother renting or (heaven forbid!) buying the movie. You already saw the good parts.I just wanted to poke both of these idiots in the eye after about a half hour. I watched the whole dang movie waiting for it to "get funny"...and it never did. No matter how much I smoked, it just didn't ever get funny. And I usually like watching idiots blunder around!Just do yourself a favor and at least rent it before you buy...this isn't a good flick to buy on the assumption it's gonna be good.$LABEL$0,1,1
Streamlight Stinger Battery. I purchased this battery on Amazon in November, 2009, from another supplier. Much like a couple of the reviews mentioned I host a battery "Exercised in Chine". I didn't think much of it at the time. It seemed to charge in the same amount of time and have about the same battery life as the OEM that lasted me numerous years.I have now noticed I get about 10 minutes on a full charge. My old "original" battery lasted me about 10 years and got me around 1 hour of use per charge. This is less than a year old and I have been using the flashlight the same as I always have.Moral of the story, in this case saving money will not be a benefit if you use your flashlight frequently. I will not buy a "Made in China" battery for my stinger ever again.I'm not bashing "Made in China" and I don't normally write reviews, but keep my review in mind when ordering.$LABEL$0,1,1

Slapstick. Davy Bowman is growing up during WWII in Illinois and must deal with the changes going on around him. His brother, a pilot trainee joins up... his father, a WWI vet owns the local gas station and they are expected to ration food, rubber, gas, and other precious staples. He and his best friend travel around on their bikes savaging metal for the war effort.This was an pleasurable (and educational) narratives of how a country pitched in to help each other during a time of crisis. I particularly enjoyed reading about the various characters that inhabited the town, and the cantankerous old teacher Miss Titus that put a mousetrap in her purse to thwart the class bully.

Up or Down?. Really snapped on the movie.I loved the debut, but found myself wondering suitably away, "Just how is this a kid's movie?" The plot was just too grown-up. Still they started haphazardly throwing in this random stuff obviously meant to amuse young children. It was delicate.Don't get me wrong. The beginning was engrossing. The animation was great. Most of the characters were genuinely lovable, especially the old man and Kevin. But in the end, it just felt like an ugly patchwork - bits and pieces were extraordinary, but ultimately, everything clashed.For the record, I have no problem with talking animals or nonsense in a children's movie - I even expect them. And I truly love Pixar. But this film just didn't sit right with me. The idea was very adult-minded, and it didn't seem like Disney quite worked out what message they wanted to send to kids. Very confusing.Although I really enjoyed some parts, Up left me feeling down..$LABEL$0,1,1

Delicate conglomeration of narratives without multiple Heavy Paintings. More than anything, this is a glean of first-person speaks with former activates in OSS during WW2, weakly cobbled jointly with some uncritical fills descriptive. Except there are some brief sections that influencing on the broader challenges and decided of the American intelligence effort, most of it implicating repetitive first-person accountancy of people hiding in the woods from the Nazis. Without that sounds breathtaking, it isn't. I came away from the livres with a low understanding of what the guys on the ground went through, but with almost no sense of the strategic challenges that sent them there. Having said that, it is an easy read, if only because it is largely devoid of interesting ideas.I would not recommend this to someone who wants to understand the broad sweep of the American intelligence effort in WW2. I would recommend this to someone who has some interest in first-hand accounts of the operatives on the ground.$LABEL$0,1,1
frigid Buk novelty item. Bring Me Your Love is a 1983 short story by Charles Bukowski. The story itself is above average for Buk and far superior to There's No Business, which is offered by Black Sparrow Press in this same format. The R. Crumb art is very compatible with the tale. It's the story of a man visiting his wife in a mental institution and the conversations that follow. Typical Bukowski subject matter...madhouses, women, sex, booze & not much hope at all. If your shelves are already filled with the real Buk books, I would definitely recommend adding this to your collection. Keep in mind, we are talking about a fifteen page book here! There's not much tohold, hence the great price.$LABEL$1,1,0
Mala From the Outset. I purchased this product shortly after buying a home with a non-working furnace. I also purchased 2 space heaters from another vendor. The other vendors products have worked as expected (thank god), but the Honeywell space heater was defective from the first. I probably should have dealt with it sooner, but with painting, plumbing, and refinishing floors and all of the chaos that comes with a fixer upper I let it go.It runs well for about 3-5 minutes and then shuts off. I susppect a defective heat turn-off. I called the service number on the bottom of the unit and was told to mail the unit for a replacement. The cost of shipping was to be paid by me. Since this was a cheap unit, and they were going to replace it with another cheap, possibly defective unit, I decided to save the shipping cost and just toss this thing in the trash.$LABEL$0,1,1

Nice but not bestest for every stardate with. I bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy. I liked the stroller with air-filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel-locks.

Imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk. It's inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car's trunk.

Tough Vacation Read. The two biggest complaints about the book are the existence of stock characters and less than believable plot twists.I found the characters strong. Perhaps they were not multifaceted or three dimensional, but it wasn't like the protagonists had no negative attributes or you had no sympathy for what the chief antagonist, Nicky, must have gone through in life.I am confused by what other reviewers found unbelievable in various plot twists. Biggest plot twists are premised on the fact that organizations, legal or illegal, seek to safeguard their assets in a variety of ways, legal and illegal. Good people make poor choices. None of these are shocking.I tried and failed to read this book traveling on Amtrak with my children, but that was more because of their behavior. I then read it thoroughly in about 4 days. Good read, interesting information, challenging focus. I strongly recommend you read this all at once as there are a lot of twists and turns.$LABEL$1,1,0

Pompous stories from another world. I first came across this book while reading Francine Prose's "Reading Like a Writer." She provided a short excerpt from "A Distant Episode" and I was intrigued.That particular story - the first in this collection selected by Bowles - was perhaps the most arresting, but they were all interesting. Each story quickly draws you into an exotic world with characters and settings that are palpable.Perhaps I was most taken in by how different each of the stories seemed to be. From a horrifying, violent descent into obscurity and insanity to a simple collection of letters by a single author. From compact, intense stories to a meandering walk through the life of an older, single woman in a foreign place.These images have stayed with me long after I put the book down.$LABEL$1,1,0

Outrageous Cookbook. I ordered this because it was compared to Mary Higgins Clark. There is no way this book or auteur could likened to MHC. Except the storyline sounded startling, it not only knocks on with an endless history learning afforded by the characters, but one would get the impression that everyone in the 1500's was either gay or had no moral character whatsoever. The language and sexes contented in this book is not something I want or should happen compulsory in a booming nouveau. Mary Higgins Clark enjoys been writing books for more years than I can count, and she has never needed to put smut or language in her books to have them pouring off the shelf. After reading about 1/2 of the book, and getting way too many sexually explicit pictures in my head, I had had enough, and decided to forget trying to finish it.

The allright book I read on preparing to have a new baby. The book focuses on the most important relationship to a baby--how the parent's relate to each other after the first child is born. The stability and love (or lack thereof) in the parental relationship creates the environment in which the child is raised. Men and women have different expectations and reactions to the birth of a child. This book is a long-term case study of what types of marriages grow stronger, stay the same or get weaker as a result of the birth of a child. The insights I gained helped me to modify and be aware of issues in my marriage that having children creates. I believe my marriage has grown stronger after children and part of the reason was the insight gained from this book.$LABEL$1,1,0

I bought a video copy when it came out on VHS; and I bought the DVD version when it came out a few years ago. This current DVD edition is the best yet. Compared to the orginal DVD, which I looked at for the sake of comparison, this 2003 edition has a much clearer image, better color, and a more balanced contrast. Although I have not been able to find any statement verifying my conclusion, I feel strongly the film has been digitally remastered for this special edition.

To me, her voice has always been strong and overshadows Kenny's. The concept of for lovers (always a good theme) kinda left me hanging on this CD because except for the title track (the best on the CD) and Loveable (From Head to Toe), the CD is remakes. I would have thought that these 2 contemporaries would have come up with original material.

too disparate from the earlier publishing. I came across a fully early edition of this book and reckon it was great, but it was out of print. I thinks that this livre would sunt equivalent but there were important disparity. If the till versions fuelled grande word showed structured around the consonants, this literature was holds around vowel. The only speaking roster that were based on consonants were many younger in comparison. Although I envoys the books back and can't references it, I seem to commemorate that they were around 15 to 20 words long. Also, while the words in the earlier edition were useful for adults, the words in this later edition seemed to be geared toward children. For me, the book went back, although someone who is focused on vowels and working with children would probably find it useful.$LABEL$0,1,1

massively overrated. Rick Linklater brought this movie off on a shoestring budget: it follows, without a fairytales, the various reflections of residents in the student ghetto area of UT Austin.I've always thought this movie was greatly overestimated: there are some good lines, but not really "dialogue." Pretty much all the characters talks the same: like Richard Linklater, presumably. It's really just a continuous, invariably amusing monologue that simply drifts from one character to another.Linklater went on to do some legitimately good films, but this one, his third film, hardly deserves the massive study edition that this Criterion Collection edition is.$LABEL$0,1,1

Course Over-hyped. As a lifelong Beach Boys fan I had hoped SMILE would live up to the billing and hype of the reviewers...was I wrong!I recall listening to many of these silly songs while in college in the early 70's on the SMILEY SMILE ambum. Something profound here for sure. PET SOUNDS is the Beach Boys masterpiece that deserves all the adulation and hype one can bestow...it is truly a brilliant symphony of youthful hopes, dreams, and emotions.

Outrageous implementation of great product. This product is Wonderful and Horrendous. It's extremely frustrating that it isn't better implemented. As many are trying to increase their intake of fresh vegetables, this product makes it so much easier.

The other complaint is that the water reservoir leaks all over the counter. I'd be thrilled to pay $80.00 for this product or more if it were just made better.

Seul good if you are incredibly out of shaping!. After my first two years in college, I would to missed some of the clout I had gained. This DVD was cheap and I needed to tighten up my arms so I bought it. Overall I can say is I did this about twice and now it's collecting grit. Like another reviewer said, it is boring and the instructor talks way too much. I'm really not used to working out a lot, especially my arms but I found this too easy and way too boring. They definitely could have cut out some of the talking and made it quicker. It would be good to do if you only have a couple minutes but the lengthiness of it due to unnessecary talking makes that impossible.

The first attempt at a newer biography of St. Bernardo. Still in a new edition edited and with an introduction and annotation Johns Sweeny, The Road To Assisi: The Essential Biography of St. Francis was first published in French in 1894, as the first attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis, one of the most beloved figures of Christian history. Author Paul Sabatier struggled to answer the question: who was Francis the man? Groundbreaking research disclosed the a solely humanistic portrayal of a man who was nonetheless gentle, passionate, joyful, and who desired to live as Jesus once taught his disciples. An extraordinary work that covers Francis' weaknesses as surely as his strengths, enhanced by the annotation and sidebars that place events of Francis' life in historical context. Highly recommended for individual reading as well as biography shelves, and a must-have for library collections.$LABEL$1,1,0

Quite Poor. I only purchased it because I was in downtown Phoenix for a conference and couldn't find a real book store within walking distance. I was stuck with the hotel's W.H.

I also liked the sprinkles of social commentary, particularly the discrimination fathers face in custody proceeedings.However, the plot quickly became utterly -- and I mean utterly -- predictable. The only suspense left for me was seeing just how long it would take the main character to figure out what I had figured out, and details of the resolution.

Grandiose. Many might feel with this effort that Welsh is merely rehashing Trainspotting...in fact all of the major characters from that story make a summarily appearance in Glue. Nevertheless, though Welsh's familiar themes of drug abuse, sex and delinquency abound, Glue is a story about people.The book details the life of four close friends growing up in Scotland from the 1970s into the new millenium...through troubles and joys. It is a laugh itl told with Welsh's unrestrained yet stylish flair. The human element is very strong here...we see the four friends in every light; what brings them together, what drives them apart and ultimately the tragedy that they must all overcome. It is a sad and beautiful story, yet more upbeat than some of Welsh's previous works. Personally, I think it is his finest. If you enjoyed Welsh's other efforts, definitely pick this one up today. It is worth every page.$LABEL$1,1,0

Dragged down by a bothersome legend and amiss writing. It emerges that around the late 90s, Koontz was prepares a rather wordy, pompous writing lifestyle. That pamphlets, along with False Memoirs, is saddled down by fascinating analogies, irritating metaphors, and questionable word usage. We all know Grisham is a great writer, but at this point he begins showing off too much, which is honestly off fixing.Despite the above, a Koontz novel can be saved by a compelling plot.

A rebuttal to Lundin. The book is an edited collection of essays protesting what its authors regard as the undue hegemony of liberal/progressive/PC ideology in clinical psychology. Many of the opinions say are rashid, well supported by fact, and long overdue. Meanwhile, even those I find wrongheaded are largely to the left of Fox News, the WSJ editorial page, and Mussolini. The citations in Roger Carlson's checkups are caricatures of what is actually said; for this the only remedy is to read the book and draw your own conclusions.

Once I got into it, the story is fluid. I found my self lost in a world of drugs, lust, friendship and trauma. I highly praised the book to anyone who either grew up different or in Minneapolis. Either way this will hit home... Being your self and being true to that is. Vivid characters and a wait and see outlook make a great combination. I can't explain it, just read it.

Cheezy abuses fantasy.... I contemplate the cinema should've been dubbed either "Sorrow Man" or "Envy Miseries". What in God's nominations were they kwun?

Well, I can't dis me desired anything more from the master of Burlesque and Basic Instinct. On second thought, maybe I did a little, because I enjoyed Total Recall and Starship Troopers. (And just between you and me, I liked both Showgirls and Basic Instinct. Shhh.)The score is better than the film. And, you know what? The special effects here are overrated. Stupid cartoon CGI.

Closure?.

The close of the story is something like a statement of life...Life is... what you make of it...Plain and simple...For overall anime quality, I like it.For overall delivery, the message was clear to those looking for the message.For overall story, it has a definite apocalyptic/rainbow at the end of the tunnel feel (Though like a rainbow you only see it but can't touch it).I would buy it again if I lost my copy.$LABEL$1,1,0

Inoperative Self-Imitation..

Thor - Another Bling in the Marvel Series. Thor is a footage that has to be looked at on a number of levels. The action and effects is unresolved. The movie scenes are rich in design and colors projecting an art deco version of Valhalla. The action scenes are loaded with drama and in some cases with elements of humour. What is unexpected is underlying theme of loss and redemption, a raw callous youth coming to understand responsibility is all about. Thor's banishment to Earth, his realization of loss, and his redemption through being to willing to sacrifice his life to preserve planet is a theme one does not expect in a live action comic book. Thor works on all levels. There may be a few problems with the script and some parts that should have gone on the cutting room floor but overall a very enjoyable flic.$LABEL$1,1,0

You really don't want to read this. The marketing for this book is unnerving. Catchy. And not just for children. Using the negative to get one's attention works for adults as well. "Don't read this.

This is a wicked children's livre. This is a destructive book, with dark themes that have no redeeming value, not even the author's inclusion of vocabulary words. It's a sign of our culture, which has become mesmerized by what's ugly and demoralizing, something much easier to strive for and achieve than that which is beautiful and inspiring.$LABEL$0,1,1
This book was absolutely startling.... This book is filled with numerous short escudos, the themes of all talking to the struggle of Puerto Rican emmigrants to the US. Specifically in Harlem, New York. Although on the surface the stories may seem somewhat somber and simple, it is not until you read into the phraseology that you come to understand the underlying statement that Soto is making. It makes one realize that the United States really does not uphold the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as it makes you think. It shows us that these rights are exclusively available to the group to which the government extends them. If you are not of white caucassien origin you simply have to fight for a chance, a chance to live, and a chance to feel the "privilege" of being successful. Read it one, two, or three times because each time you come to different realizations on what he is saying...$LABEL$1,1,0

It's not a large clock-dimensions are imperfect!. This clock was doubted to be 5 tenth 4 x 1 inch-it's about 2 1/2" by 1" by 3/4". I bought it for my car but it's not large enough!$LABEL$0,1,1
I feel pretty stupid buying this book.. I would give this book one star but there are probably some guys out there that do not know the amazingly rationalized things these guys tell you. If you don't know to go to the dentist, not to wear sweatpants in public (see Seinfeld episode), and not let your hair grow down your neck, then buy this book. Other facts, such as good places to meet women, i.e., bookstores, coffee shops, are common knowledge. Some advice, such as first dates should be short and are best at coffee shops are intelligent but again should already be known. Bottom line, I don't have "game," and if you don't have that you aren't going to meet womeon. This book helps you in the conversation department. Other obvious directions are give up the cancer sticks and talk to all women. I guess that works. There is no magic pill guys, and this book won't help you.$LABEL$0,1,1
epic betray. this gaming acquiring boring as you will, the histories is somewhat bland, and whoever took up with the cease need to remain slapped. it sucked! you'll strive to introduced your PS2 through a berm when this match is over. buy 'Star Oceana: til the culminates of time' however. it is waaaaaaaaay better.but if you are meanwhile inquisitive...the premise is the same as any other final fantasy wagers. there is a fine homie. a bad guy. a guy that turns out to be the real baddest bad guy and a chick. add in a quest, random battles, optional megaultrasuper bosses, characters that join with bad attitudes and reaaaaaaaaaalllllllllly big weapons. don't get me wrong, square enix pumps out some good RPG's, but this one just sucked.$LABEL$0,1,1
Admirable. I love 2 Unlimited. I had no knowledge of them during the 90s, they were not on Chicago radio. Chgo radio had good dance/trance/rave on B96 until 1993 or so, then for some reason, they stopped playing. Not until 1998, a college radio station featured hot dance music, which morphed into Energy radio in 2001...then they went off the air! Arrghh!!I found 2Unlimited through Amazon, featured on the Jock Jams collections. So many things in life, I wonder, why didn't I know about this sooner??...and I was not a hermit or living in a cave.I play 2 Unlimited all the time now. Hope they reunite so we can see them again.$LABEL$1,1,0
Soft Porn. I was really looking forward to reading this book but it discouraging me. The plot and charaters at the begining are hard to surveilling. Then the schoolbooks degenerates into namely the sexual exploits of the main charater and unprobable gun fights. These book is really adolescent and appears to be formulated by a teenager. I ai about halfway through the book and it did not appear to be going anywhere getting any better so exited reading it. Maggio Amazon availability buy it back slightly used.$LABEL$0,1,1

Fireproof is apparently "Fire Proof". This is a grandiose movie - something every couple, whether brides or not, should look this film. There are some beaux lessons here that we all can learn from. That is a "5+" film.$LABEL$1,1,0

Would be 5 stars if it worked.. My Nomad II worked for a omnibus of 1 hour, then the screen gave out and the interface with my PC died.However, that 1 hour was great, clear powerful sound...light as hell...easy to use. I'm consigned it back for another in hopes this was a fluke, but right now i'm too craziness to enabling it anything more than a shooting star.$LABEL$0,1,1
Both Doubling. It was also punchy! The auteur could enjoys exerted it a great book. Too much indications, the story was bland, people swore. Until this book was a productions, it would be PG-13. Qui in their proper wit would achieve a clone of themselves. Onto the measure department I would give it a 2, Awaited 1. Overall, a silent book. I amal this review was helpful. me wouldn't waste my money....$LABEL$0,1,1
FOND IT!. I was dumbfounded to read these reviews after I had already ordered and received my Pik Stik as I received mine very quickly. I am a big user of these items and actually have one of each length. I specifically ordered this size as its the one I use the most. I use the larger one for cleaning high places using a rag. I have severe arthritis, spinal stenosis and carpal tunnel,and use the shortest one as a dressing aid. If I can squeeze the handles, anyone can. I would highly recommend these to anyone and as I said previously, I received mine quickly and efficiently. I am new to Clares but hope to return. J. Nixon$LABEL$1,1,0

He is 5'11" and masses 160 quid. Until, the doctor gave him antibiotics and he was to grabs Mucinex PR as so as an asthma for three deadline. Among the iii dating my son's college calling and notices me that he was hallucinating and vulnerable. It also hadn't eaten anything that day and his blood pressure was 180/100. We immediately brought him to the emergency room to get him checked. He has not taken the Mucinex in over 48 hours now and is just starting to feel better (less high). I took him off Mucinex immediately but didn't realize that it could cause hallucinations. I never would have given it to him. So, I am glad that others reported this and I will never, ever buy that product again. I thank God because it could have turned out worse than it did.$LABEL$0,1,1
It Should Have Been Better. Just felt the cine; was a big fan of Saints I. It pains me to say that while it's watchable, it's then cartoonish and overdone. The brothers' liaise is taken for granted, and they are moved through necessary gunfights like pieces on a board. The cartoon between them and their Mexican sidekick is imposter and overdone, and his characters is never gross. And Peter Fonda's accent coups. He obviously didn't take quite time preparing for his role, as limited as it was. Don't get me wrong -- the movie wasn't terrible, but it could -- and should -- have been so much better. I watch the original every so often. I don't think I'll watch this one again.$LABEL$0,1,1
