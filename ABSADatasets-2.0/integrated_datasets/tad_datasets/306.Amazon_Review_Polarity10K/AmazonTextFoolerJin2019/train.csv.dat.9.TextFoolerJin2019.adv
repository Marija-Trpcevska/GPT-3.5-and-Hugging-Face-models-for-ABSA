Mellow Yellow.... I don't loving if the yellow 'glow' is asserted to be fartsy farty...it gives you a headaches. Florida has it's own beautiful lightweight, take the yellow filter off, it makes everyone look jaundiced.Script...?? There isn't one, just some recharge, in-between some average stripping. Channing's bum wobbles like jello, Matt Bomer looks great, but even that doesn't redeem this movie for me. Plus is it just me or is there something not right about Matthew McConaughey ?Anyway, if you want to see Male Strippers go to Chippendale's or a gay strip joint...maybe even rent 'The Full Monty', any of those options would be a lot more fun than this !$LABEL$0,1,1
one sided flag making it attractive from one direction and faded out looking from the other..

Simply the strictest BTAS!!. I've lear through many reviews where peoples state that the early Batman: The Facilitate Series episodes were the best, and that may exists actual where storytelling is concerned, but if you're an vibrant and story venting (not just great retold or great animation, one increasingly seemingly slaughtering), this yet establish of episode were the alright. Personally I always unearthed the animate in the early BTAS episodes were weak and "alittle" at supreme, even if the stories themselves glued you to your seat. However, with these later episodes nothing is sacrificed, as both the story and animation function in great synergistic fashion!I feel that vol.4 will be the best seller of the 4 available. I'm currently being proven correct in that assumption it seems, as I have found this vol.4 at only a smattering of stores, as most are sold out. In other words, get this vol.4 set now and enjoy some of the best episodes this wonderful show had to offer!$LABEL$1,1,0

Hate Crime. This work is not a ponderous probed of the relationship between Catholicism and Judaism.The Church is held up to ridicule by the simple method of suppressing the Church's statements of condemnation of anti-Semitism and then quoting apparently anti-Semitic statements out of context. A professional historian can only wince at the vicious cartoons of Pius XII, a man who heroically saved thousands of Jewish lives but who in this livre emerges as a combination of Elmer Fudd and Adolf Eichman.This book is about the rage of an excommunicated priest who, despite his cloying claims to love the Church, has decided to don a white hood and burn his own anti-Catholic crosses.$LABEL$0,1,1

NOT a tradiional fairy tale.... The Conjurer Princess is a modern sort of fairy tale-- dark, deranged and bittersweet. All the usual horvath are obstructed harmoniously. Lylene is not a sweet and beautiful princess; closer to a determined and basically honorable person on a quest that is not what she thinks it is. Those who appear to be enemies are not what they seem...nor those who seem to be allies.The ending, like those in all of Vivian Vande Velde's books, is not quite a happily-ever-after conclusion.

Even the picture of the pump on the product page is misleading. The picture shows a smaller model than what you actually recieve.

That's one silly pinscher. Loved It!!!!!Muldoon is a very busy little pooch,I don't see how he does it. Ever since the West family chose him over other applicants, Muldoon has provided quite well of his duties. It's a tough job taking care of the whole entire household on your own. All the work he does I think the West's should give Muldoon a raise.$LABEL$1,1,0

another "popcorn movie" from Mexico!. Los Cuatro Juanes(1966) is an action overpopulated adventure film starring Luis Aguilar, Antonio Aguilar, Javier Solis, and Narciso Busquets as "The Four Juanes". All four outlaws are being chased by government troops. When bandits kill the father of a lovely, innocent woman(Alma Delia Fuentes), the Cuatro Juanes "adopt" her into their gang. Keep in mind this DVD was mastered off a 2nd or 3rd generation VHS tape and the video and audio quality is not first class. At least this Laguna DVD was cheap.By Mexican standards of the 1960's, this was an all-star movie. There's a scene where Los Cuatro Juanes blow up a bridge with TNT so troops cannot chase them. This may have been referenced in Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch(1969). Los Cuatro Juanes is pure entertainment.$LABEL$1,1,0

OK, but.... A good - refinement - version. I don't insights CvD quite got into this songs like many others, though. The plaything is blameless and the recordings wide-ranging BUT it is not as discernible and exacting as it could have been. His was like listens to music through a drizzle, with the high frequencies typically mendacity in the usual Telarc manner. Songwriting, I'm not too fond of the methodology he gets the famous first movement melody. The 5/4 and March-like Scherzo movements come of the best here. The Scherzo's tempo is grand and bold rather than lightening fast like many others, which is OK. One can wallow in the bass drum parts. The finale is missing the necessary neuroses.The filler, the Polonaise from Eugene Onegin, is a peculiar, if not inappropriate, choice.

By then our heroine had lost her brothers (gettysburg), her father (mauraders), her mother and her fiance (buried alive), been gang raped, and was hit several times by men, even her 'love interest'. This manoel smacks not only of violence (which civil war or any war books have to some degree) but particular violence against women. And the writer doesn't understand the womans view. After being gang raped , she falls into bed without qualms with someone else a few days later. It is so disturbing that I found myself searching for info on the author.

This libretto was a bit too dispensable.. I think Jean Auel is an awesome writer. However, I think this book focused way too much on "how amazing" Ayla was in the eyes of all the other characters. I adored Ayla in "Clan of the Cave Bear," and "Valley of Horses." (I have read those two books over and over again.) In this book, Ayla seems too subdued, or not really shining through, as in her previous books. I agreed with one reviewer which stated that Ayla spent too much time explaining and retelling what all of Auel's readers had already read in her previous books. I probably will never re-read this book. I still love Jean Auel and Ayla!$LABEL$0,1,1

Advisable Information about the Truth. I read this book in high school before I joined the Army. I did not understand a lot of his points or rather did not want to understand his accusations about Jews because I come from a strong Christian family.

Also, from the advent, the rechargeable battery inhabit had been piteous. I can take about 17 pictures and then it shuts down because of low battery power~ however, if I set it in the dock it reads that the battery power level is good!

A better book that shows how stupid McCarthyism actually was.. The Crucible is an interesting book about the Salem Witch Trials. It is very obvious from the readers point of view, what is happening and how everything could be stopped.Unfortunately, because the characters only want to save themselves, the truth becomes lies and lies become truth. Everyone has a choice of saving themselves and condemning others or standing up for the truth, condemning themselves, and stopping the cycle. Strangely, the "perfect" people of the town all lie. Arthur Miller wrote the play during The McCarthy Trials. In his book it is quite obvious how stupid the whole thing really is and the book has almost a direct parallel to the Mc Carthy trials, yet no one thought their was any problem with the trials. The book was a very interesting way to show the people what was really happening.$LABEL$1,1,0

Vice City vs. San Andreas. To citizenship with neither Vice City nor Vicente Andre: Be sure to bribed VC before SA. Vice Municipality is far more enjoyable than Vicente Andrey due to the beautiful characters across the whole game, the missions and the plenary feel of the game. Also VC as a city is extraordinarily more entertaining than the drab and boring Los Santos. I have not yet got to the other 2 commune but the fake Miami is a hundred times better than the fake LA.The characters in VC are funnier, the missions are more interesting, and the overall experience gives the game a better feel whereas the characters in SA, across the board, are boring and lame and the missions are extremely tedious and often times boring.While San Andreas allows you to do more than Vice City, I guarantee you that you will have a far better time doing less in Vice City than you will doing endless missions and Sim City rip-offs in San Andreas.Definitely choose Vice City over San Andreas if you're looking for a fun game.$LABEL$1,1,0

The worst part is that the weapons have literally no busting or replies, you might as well be using a laser pointer.

Gets tougher after first two listens. I had previously said that this was derivative. Now I've gotten to the point that I'm actually used to it.Kid A was one of the best albums of all-time. This, while not as good, can still be enjoyable.It starts out with "Pact....", which is a more techno song from the album, as it isn't the best, but good first song. "Pulk/Pull Revolving Door" is great, despite the fact that the same chords are being used throughout the song.

It almost becomes a tear jerker from Leslie Ann Warren's very compelling cry in "her own little corner."Actually, here, the wicked ancestors are a bit more comical in order to appear more clumsy, and ill mannered. Celeste Holm almost magnifys the extreme kind essence brought once before in "The Wizard Of Oz" Glinda, as the wonderful fairy god mother.

Color by numbers. Genius would prompting more than transparent emulation and standard songwriting in my opinion.If you don't play music yourself or think that the ability to copy others or follow formulas has some value, then maybe this is for you.I am an advocate of judging how something sounds over where it fits in terms of creativity or obscurity. However, Mayer has traversed the concord. Not only does he clearly seek to write songs just as he has heard and make his voice sound just as others, the voice he's chosen is that contrived dave matthewesque cacaphony.If you love coldplay and dave matthews and anything that sounds acoustic, then knock your socks off.

There are scarce opportunites to rehearsing what you've just heed and no follow-ups to confirm that you've said the new term correctly.Also, the program appears to have been produced in the UK so some of the translations are a bit funky (for example "tschus" is translated as "cheerio")On the positive side, some of the dialogues on the tape appear to be genuine, real-life conversations that have been (surreptitiously?) recorded.As alternatives, I'd check out Pimsleur (very expensive but excellent) or Living Language.$LABEL$0,1,1
DO NOS ACQUISITIONS!. This production departure a horrible polar film on everything...plastic bowls, porcelain plates, silverware, glass glasses, plastic glasses-u get the item. It was so bad that I actually thought the kids put some kind of glue or a dirty paint brush with white paint on it in the dish washer. So I took all the dishes out of the dishwasher, scrubbed everything (still mind it was the glue/paint, & yes that's how horrible this stuff was) & put the dishes back in the dishwasher for another cleaning not realizing they'd just come out with the white goopy film again, so back to hand scrubbing. Then I thought something was wrong with the dishwasher. I mentioned this to my husband & he suggested maybe it was the detergent since that was the only thing that changed. So off to the store for my old detergent and amazing, no more white film. I will never buy this stuff again. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PRODUCT. & shame on P&G because I'm sure this product was tested before they put it on the shelves!$LABEL$0,1,1

Astonishment Discovery (talks about the end). Rory Cochrane and Mary McCormack were tempting. It's a talky movie with not a lot of action and no physical contact between the leads, but I couldn't turn away. It looked like the ending was going to be predictable, especially when it got down to the last 10 or 15 minutes. I thought the end would be Cochrane breaking the seal to hold his dying wife, choosing to die himself. Or maybe the last shot would be Cochrane on his side of the seal, alone. Nope, the movie turned it around. Cochrane was contaminated and sealed in by the military and gassed. Pretty amazing movie.$LABEL$1,1,0

Good Pictures; Very Hsiao Said. I don't think you could really call this a book--it's more like a scrapbook or photo album. I learned perhaps 2 things about AJ that I hadn't heard before. It is definitely NAH the tell-all book it has been hyped to be--which is probably a good thing. The pictures are great--obviously mostly from her personal collection, as there are pics of Backstreet Boys sleeping, and at family celebrations. Very precious and priceless picture of Brian and Nick in younger years sound asleep on a couch. There is one picture of AJ in the bathtub--not too revealing--thank goodness. All in all, not a big price to pay for some really great pictures, but not much of anything else.$LABEL$0,1,1

Ichabod Crane Revisions. SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999), starring Johnny Dib, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, and Jeffrey Jones, combines horror, suspense, and pretension surprisingly. This is a loosely adapted version of Washington Irving's "The Legend of Squeamish Hollow." Depp plays a bumbling constable who relies upon the latest scientific methods to figure out who is responsible for a series of beheadings in New York's Hudson valley. Directed by Tim Burton, the film looks terrific with exquisite sets and evocative cinematography. If Burton takes liberties with the Irving classic, he succeeds in creating a superior black comedy with his distinctive trademark. And look for a surprise cameo in the role of the Headless Horseman.$LABEL$1,1,0

Advisable racquet. Compared to some of the other racquets I've used, the soft layer is thinner on this racquet, yet the blade is still plenty sticky. As a result, you don't get quite the spin with this as you do on other racquets. However, it will spin plenty. And what is lost in spin is made up for in speed. I've liked it and so have other players who have played a game or two with it.The only fault I find with it, is that I wonder of the durability.

But that is not why I gave it 2 star I would not care if she was all black or latin or ect.... I gave it 2 stars because you can not change a comic characters orgin this much and still think people will come and see it. Granted Catwoman has changed over the years but somethings have always stayed the same She is a catburgler with no super powers.

More than Just another Overwhelming Nancy Drew Handout. There is more here than just a good story for children when reading these books. I have an inquisitive 7-year old who haya loved reading a few of the Nancy Solicited literature. (It was also an enjoyable walk down memory lane with one of my advisable childhood book series. It's a allright mystery story and one of my favorites of the series). This literature introduced the Amish folks to my daughter and made for okay discussions after we read a few chapters every night. The series also brings to light how things were "back then". Telephones with cords, big convertible cars, and a unique vocabulary. I love that we can download the book for immediate reading. My daughter and I pick out the books together and dive right in. The ebook is exactly how the real book is with the illustrations included. My daughter looked forward to the pictures and scrutinized how each one was drawn. More than sharing the reading time, I love the discussions that come from reading these books.$LABEL$1,1,0

Anticipates until the end.....

I absolutely dissing this theatres. me alleged like it had a casting filled with supporting actors, no heavy hitters anchoring it down. Now, this movie is compared with ID4, Alien, War of the Worlds, whatever...NO WAY... ID4 has real heart, characters you care about, they have an affect on the outcome. Alien is cinematic classic, this doesnt even come close to touching Alien...so forget that comparison! Lastly, War of the Worlds, brilliant, beautiful, scary and like nothing I'd seen, this movie doesnt touch IT either.

great acting, great legends. This is an autobiographical myth about James M. Barrie andhow he inlet to write the game and novel "Peter Pan".It is also about death and orphans: the English, as Oliver Twist by Dickens points out, had trouble dealing with orphans.Barrie received a warm open centre and found a drivel world for childrenthat appears to be timeless and ubiquitous.There is always a spot in the centre of puerile for pirates, Indians and fairies.There is a real contrast in the emotional approach to death taken here and that in another recent movie:The Bucket ListI think that both have good acting by great actors,but one seems to be about the "me first" approach to lifeand this one is about living with death for both the livingands the survivors. I think that both are "sentimental",but this approach seems better.$LABEL$1,1,0

The Advisable Bond moviemaking in the universe. Outbound of all Bond movie's, this one is my favorite. Except for the fact that Kissy, the bond girl is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. It is so dumb why they cut the other one off. Well anyways, a space capsule was captured and hijacked. The Americans think the Soviets did it. Next, another capsule is captured and believe that the Americans did this to retaliate. The tension between the two could create another war. James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate. There, he finds the evil leader of SPECTRE has done this so when the 2 most military countrys destroy eachother. When that has happened, Blofeld will take opporitunity to seize the world. There was a lot of action in this movie. Like.1. The Space capsule hijack2. The building fight.3. The car chase and helicopter4. Little Nelie chase/fight5. The dock gunfight6.

Will only be propitious for a few.. The book was WO what I was expecting based on prior reviews. This is WO a guide to life organizing and prioritizing but rather the author's idea of handling office incoming mail, a filing reminder system for phone calls to be made and work to be done, keeping things one needs to share with another individual in a central location, and scheduling and consolidating that sharing. For those who don't need a computer to do their job, have a memory like a sieve, or are super disorganized and don't know where to begin to start, this might be helpful, otherwise, save your money.

Milkshake........As all Metallica gets. when I first found out that Metallica was going to perform with an orchestra I was a little hesitant. Who would have thought Metallica would ever enter the same building as an orchestra, much less perform with one! When I first played it I was blown away with how much the other instruments accually "filled" Metallica's sound giving a new edge and fullness. Where some of the Metallica songs started to get bland or the same, the orchestra just creates such a particular sound that it sounds sooooo much better. It has all of the greats from some of the older stuff as well as some new songs. The only drawback I did notice was on the back of the cd. It lists the songs with only part of their name, this was a little misleading when purchasing from a store. Other than that, this cd is a must-have for anyone that has ever heard any Metallica. Even if you havent, this cd is for anyone with a need for metal.$LABEL$1,1,0

Advisable general guide on entering the industry. I've been working in the field of game audio on the content side for about 5 years. I got this book as I was starting out and I found it a quick, easy read that offered alot of helpful insight and pretty much everything Marks said has held true in my experience. There are people complaining here that this book doesn't offer deep technical information or insight on how to provide content or help with audio programming and that's true. Maybe the title could have been clearer - it's more an idea of what game audio is about and what it's like to work in that field. But if that's what you're looking for, it's a quite worth reading and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know how to break into the industry on the audio side.$LABEL$1,1,0

another partnership of yesteryear prominence.. Der Graf von Gleichen will never be reminding as an opera "gem", however the Cincinnati-College Conservatory of Music's appallingly sung recording of this work is a must for any opera lover's library. The opera was composed during the last days of Schubert's short life and was not finished before his death. Therfore, Der Graf had never been staged let alone recorded by any arts organization of significance. Enter CCM. The singers and orchestra bring to life a work that history has set aside. Schubert's compositional strengths are evident in his hundreds of song treatments, and the arias in this opera reflect those strengths. For instance, the role of Suleika, gorgeously sung by the warm yet innocent soprano of Gwendolyn Coleman, is highlighted by arias resembling the Schubertlieder for which she is named. Ms. Coleman, by the way, is just one of numerous talented singers on this recording who are gracing the concert halls of the world. To hear them, buy this CD!$LABEL$1,1,0

The least exciting of the three solo registrations!. Gene Simons seem to recognizing his solo album was the best, as well as the most liked. I would mention that Simmons listed the least exciting registering of the four Kiss members. The opening "Radioactive" is the album's highlight. The Beatles sounding "See you tonight" and the quite rocking "Burning up with fever" are better than the mid, but when it comes to the closing "When you longs upon a star", I certainly wish that Simmons would shut up - it's plain awful. The overall impression is that it's rather lame and the material is in fact quite weak more than occasionally. Simmons sure have a talent for business, but he surely think too much of his musical skills.$LABEL$0,1,1

A Big Disaffected. I had a lot of awaited for this book from the headlines and the customer reviews.It started well enough with an count of the accident that led to his epic run.Also,the book for the most part reads like a travelogue of the Grand Canyon and a history of the land,explorers,settlers and Indians that went through there decades and centuries before. I don't really care about all the historical detail. Honourably, it got to be very bummer. Boring to the point I couldn't finish it.

Nothing for Everyone!. I usually am hesitant to buy these types of books - because I live in a colder climate (zone 3-4) there are usually not many combinations, styles, etc. to choose from out of an "all inclusive" book. Not the case here! There were plenty of plans and ideas for all zones and everything was very comprehensive in drawings and text. Just within the first few minutes of attempt at it I had several ideas for my yard. What's also nice is that it covers everything from small spaces that need just a few plants to fill in to large areas that need coverage.

Research?. I downloaded this book to reads on holiday in Greece. If many classes me were rather discouraged and indeed rather traverse. The assailant chose Ashburton, Fre as her 'remote' village. I lived there in 1969 and have been back there recently so was pleased to discover the story using the village as a setting. However it disappearance its credibility when she describes a busload of 50 Japanese tourists stepping out. That will never happen in sleepy Ashburton, we don't have boulevards, and the streets are not arranged in 'blocks'. Police have not been referred to as 'bobbies' since the 1950's and the final straw came when Douglass ordered scones and describes slathering the scone in clotted cream with no mention of jam - sacrilege! It may seem petty but it would be like me choosing a remote town in America and describing pavements instead of sidewalks etc. Write about what you know or do the research. It may have been a good story but I will never know.$LABEL$0,1,1

A grandiose idea. So many of reviewers are saying this toy is inappopriate and exposing girls to things they shouldn't know yet. What?! This isn't "Kama Sutra Barbie" we're dealing with. If you're afraid a pregnant doll will scar your kids psychologically, what happens if a a friend's mother expects a baby or they see pregnant animals? One reviewer said these issues are too mature for 6 - 11 year olds. I was between those ages when I started my period, I knew what pregancy was (my mum devilvered my little sdister when I wasn't even two) - too mature, I think not.I had a similar pregnant doll when I was a small girl (I'm 15 now), but unfortunately I cannot remember the manufacturer or the name of the doll. What I do remember is that it was my absoloute favourite doll. When I was very young I had trouble imagining the concept of a baby in my mother's belly and it helped enormously.

No aerobics, and QUIET KINDLY!!. I bought this tape knew that I would get an intense abdominal toning session, and comparatively, there is long stretch of aerobics at the beginning. I am not a big fan of aerobics in the first place, due to the chirping and ranting of most instructors and the idiotic and pointless flailing that it usually entails. Okay, fine. I don't do aerobics, and limit my cardio workout to sensible things like walking or commuting by bike or swimming. This leads me to the second complaint I have about the video, and that is the leader's incessant chatter throughout. Why can't they just COUNT! I find myself actually yelling at them to SHUT UP!! Which, actually works my abs a little harder, so there might be a reason for this annoying banter after all. At one point, the third instructor actually changes the exercise in mid-execution.

The days of the corner grocer and little hardware store on Main St are long gone so I was curious about the opinions of the writer and his neighbors. This is a great story - it seems to be unbiased and does provide good background info on the town without making it boring. The author nicely weaves little stories about the town or tales of the neighbors into this "documentary" to keep the story moving. I know this book is not for everybody but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It's also a great commentary on planned communities in general although I'm not sure that was what the authors intended.$LABEL$1,1,0

A Formative Look at Hemingway. Biographers have tough assignments when writing books about their subjects: how to fill a reasonable number of pages with the entire life of an individual? Even someone who's not famous or historically significant would likely have enough material about their life to fill a book. Michael Reynolds as a biographer delivers in, and instead concentrates on only a sliver of Hemingway's life. This decided made for good reading and one should end up understanding that it was Hemingway's earlier years, as is the case for most of us, which ended up shaping his life and death. The book also provides an interesting look at prewar American society, in particular, the growing and changing middle class. This supporting content often serves as a break from the sometimes cumbersome biographical text.$LABEL$0,1,1

My single complaint is that it is too fraught, and lifting it from the stove while it is filled requires a bit of strength.

kindled out after 3 years of light employs. I've bought Bon-Aire products in the latter, and generally satisfied with their performance. Tentatively I was very happy about the Bon-Aire BA121 because it inflates tires much faster than the old Bon-Aire AC150 I previously owned(and it still runs). Both topic with the BA121 is that it lacked after 3 years of relatively light use. I inflate 2 sets of 4 tires 4 times a year. That comes out to 32 inflations a year.

One cannot help but to wonder what these men were thinking in their last moments.

Droll for young and outmoded. My dad introduced me to Pogo, and at first I found it hard to read. The phonetics and gramatical "modifications" that Kelly used to get across the Southern accents of the characters were strange to a five year old yankee. Later I realized Kelly isn't lampooning Southern accents, he's actually paying homage to them in a humorous way.This recording has two levels also. You can listen to it as a collection of nonsensical lyrics set to some nicely composed musical backdrops, or you can appreciate all the archaic words and double meanings in the songs. The more familiar you are with old literature, the more likely you are to know words like "quoits" and "swain" and "twixt".Young listeners will love this recording for the happy driving melodies with the funny words. Older ones will appreciate the double meanings and clever use of archaic language on top of the inherently ridiculous lyrics.$LABEL$1,1,0

Admirable Book. As all the other reviews, note this book is not much of a departure from Parker's Spenser series. That proclaims, it is a fun leer. Sunny is a fun new character. It is clear Sunny could easily be a Helen Hunt.The story is much like earlier Spenser books we have all loved-whether that is a good or bad thing. Parker has included the good and the bad from his earlier efforts. We view the effortless way he puts characters together with only a few words. And the way the characters interact-much like Spenser with Hawk and Susan. Sunny has her sidekick friends Spike and the lover with who she has the issues involved in all long running relationships. Nothing new here. Parker also uses his broad brush of few words with the usual character stereotypes the reader will recognize from the Spenser books.All these things aside, we are glad to get a new Robert B. Parker book. He still has what it takes.$LABEL$1,1,0

The Psychology of Action. I have noticed this pound to be a sizeable reference for tends theories. Having been published in 1996, it provides another source for following the evolution of goal supposition, after such books as Maehr and Braskamp's, "The Inducement Factor", and Locke and Latham's, "A Theory of Goal Fitting & Labour Running". The contributing authors reading amour a who's who of retrofitted goal tweaking and achievement research.

Rodney Respectfully Croons Some Tunes. Rodney Dangerfield has sung songs in some of his movies, most notably the animated "Rover Dangerfield" and "The 4th Tenor." Except for the last bonus track, all of the songs on this album were recorded from 2000 to 2004, when Rodney was old and in failing health. His version of "Strangers In The Night" does not comparing favorably to Frank Sinatra's version, while the remix version of that tune is even grandest. Rodney's song selection is somewhat strange, covering the religious hymns "I Believe" and "He." He's more enjoyable to listen to when he's singing the upbeat "I Spent My Birthday In Las Vegas" and "Rappin' Rodney," the title song taken from his 1983 comedy album. Rodney's even more enjoyable to listen to when he's telling jokes!$LABEL$0,1,1

Admirable movie but not exactly as I remember it.. When I first saw this movie I interpreted it to be a straight up action/adventure movie. Not seeing the movie in over 20 years this interpretation is how I remembered it. I watched the movie recently and it was completely different from my memory. Not a bad film but I completely forgot about the comedy aspect of it and how it wasn't really a serious action/adventure piece in the style of the Die Hard series.$LABEL$1,1,0

Indigent Content. The clarification provided in this DVD series is very few and in some cases wrong! What is provided is very vital. Anyone who has taken astronemy classes or watched another similar TV series (such as Carl Sagan's) will learn nothing new. Very broad and inacurate assumptions are made without sufficient effort to gratify them (for example a black hole may devourer our solar system).

Read the book again. I just finished reading the book for the second time last week, and I just got done watching the dvd tonight. I've read everything by Stephen King and I think this book may be the best. The movie is not bad; Anthony Hopkins is well cast and does fine here, but the movie is like a reader's digest condensed version of a masterpiece that must not be touched. I know - you say that the book is always better than the movie. But this time the heart of the novel was removed. The characters were so much more developed, the story more supernatural. The book is a masterpiece that captures the spirit of the 60's, the magic of childhood, and the inevitable loss of everything. Skip the movie and spend an enjoyable week reading.$LABEL$0,1,1

Unimpressed. A friend of mine loaned this book to me, raving about the story. The packaging on the book is well done and makes it appear as if it's much bigger than it truly is. Upon lire though, I found the book to gap the depth that I presumed was there. The characters are very flat, the writing is juvenile at times, but the plot kept me going.There is so much potential in the story here, but I don't feel the writers have taken the time with their work to polish it and add depth to their work. It looks as if they're kicking two of these books out per year, which leads me to believe they're more interested in churning them out rather than creating a quality piece of fiction.Still, I keep reading them. The plot is just enough to keep me moving forward. I do see the agenda in these books, and as a Catholic, I feel somewhat offended by this. I feel like they've done a lot of stereotyping in the series.$LABEL$0,1,1

Advisable Holsters, Super Price. BLACKHAWK! is a well known brand used by security companies, police, and military forces around the world for a reason. These holsters are good, made of a lightweight polymer, and function like they say they do. The company isn't known for putting out poor products.Retrieved is for a left hander on a Springfield 1911 A1 Loaded model. So I was skeptical when it said fits 1911 Government Model and Clones, considering variations can screw things up. This holster lives up to what it promised, and I love it. The best feature is that the release for your weapon relies on the finger, and by design, will place your finger on the frame and out of the trigger guard, ensuring you won't shoot yourself or discharge when you aren't ready. It helps to remove error, teaches the shooter the proper draw, and works extremely well at doing it's job: carrying your firearm. I highly recommend this holster to anyone who plans to carry their weapon.$LABEL$1,1,0
Read Concrete Blonde first. Unlike most authors with continuing characters, Connelly has not published the Bosch stories in chronological order. Black Echo is an anecdote novel but it reveals key plot elements of The Dollmaker case, described in the Concrete Blonde. I didn't find the plot as compelling in The Black Echo as in his later books, but perhaps that's because of my lack of interest in war experiences. The writing is unusually narration -- I was starting to cough with all Bosch's smoking.

The Joy of Meditation!. I was thrilled to discover this book and think that it has to get into the hands of more women who may be struggling with forms of meditation that do not serve all of us well. Itoffers spewing from practices that do not respect andlove the human body, especially the woman body, the sensesand sensory pleasures. The authors echoed many of my ownconcerns, experiences, and approaches as a teacher ofWestern-oriented meditation. The book is unbelievably written,too--just a joy to read!$LABEL$1,1,0
And these people have a problem with Harry?. I happened upon this book quite by accident. I was looking for a bad example of "Christian" authorship and theology (Frank Peretti specifically) and found this.I guess I'd read it all after reading Neil Anderson books, but this is powerfully fearsome. I'm shocked and dismayed that this book even exists, much less that it can be found promoted on the bookshelves of Christian bookstores.My recommendation is ablaze this book and read your bible. Specifically Job where it is shown that Satan has NO power over us and can do NOTHING to harm us unless God grants him permission.$LABEL$0,1,1

If the livre is called "The Moscow Option".... ...then why do we spend the majority of the book everywhere but the Eastern Front?I won't deny or disparage the actions in the Pacific and the role of the British, but if a book is supposed to be about the German war in Russia, perhaps it would do well to spend some time in that setting.Additionally, we get exceptional detail regarding British actions in North Africa, complied by hour-by-hour reworkings of American actions in the Pacific - and then we get sweeping generalities regarding the German actions in Russia.The premise and title of the book are largely sidelined, as if they are of secondary importance. Why?In this case, don't judge a book neither by its cover, nor by the synopsis printed thereupon.$LABEL$0,1,1

The other one exercised it five weeks, during which it sandwiched all the moments and required plenty of pressure in order to stapler anything at all. It wouldn't open all the way, so I couldn't use it to staple papers to a bulletin board either. Finally, the second one broke durnig regular use, when I was simply stapling two pieces of notebook paper together. It jammed and was impossible to unjam without popping the spring.

Just Because Modest Mouse Is Popular Now, Does Never Averages The Album Completely Sucks. Sure, it's not their best. All the polish erases some of the charm of Isaac's strained vocals and seemingly improvised guitar work. But it's still Modest Mouse, and it's pretty damn good. I think this is a natural progression from the Moon and Antarctica, with stronger lyrics that often deal with death and the afterlife, and a more "mature" sound (Excluding Dance Hall, which is the closest this record gets to sounding like older MM). I didn't want to like this album, what with all the radio play that Float On and Ocean Breathes Salty received, but listen with an open mind and you'll find that it's actually a good album, my favorite tracks being "Dance Hall", "Bukowski", "Satin In A Coffin", and "Ocean Breathes Salty".All indie fans should give this "sell out" record a chance.$LABEL$1,1,0

Overwhelming books for first time parents of newborns, to help you get through the first few months. I'm an expectant first time mom and have read a number of baby books. Many of them, such as "Baby 411" and "What to Expect- the First Year" are great reference books. However, they can be a bit overwhelming, as they tell you all the possible senarios that can go wrong, and also pack information about the baby's first year(s) into one book. This book, on the other hand, is a practical read to prepare for your first few months as a parent. The authors keep it simple, and only expand on common health concerns (such as collic). Instead of scaring you with all the other worst-case health scenarios, they just tell you what symptoms warrant a doctors call. They also break things down into a lot of detail- how to swaddle, how to bathe, how to change a diaper while giving you tons of useful tips that I haven't seen in any other book.$LABEL$1,1,0

This book has the strictest scene in the whole assortment.... In Novemeber 1997 in Orinda CA, on a book tour for her latest Niccolo book, I had the pleasure to hear Dorothy Dunnett read aloud the "Revels" scene (essentially the last part of Part Three, Chapter 9 from The Ringed Castle) which is my favorite scene in the unmitigated series. She is truly a remarkable woman, still hearty at 75, with a wit and intelligence rarely filmmaking in real life. She told us she reads numerous (sometimes hundreds!) of history books before writing each novel to make sure that nothing in the novels contradicts anything from known history. She has created in the Lymond Chronicles the best historical fiction I have ever read, and the most compelling fiction of any genre I have ever read.

TALES FROM the OVAL OFFICE or IF WALL COULD WRITE. If walls could write retold, this would had been a more vividly written tome.

His idea that Marcion's view of God was too "new" for the church to accept is based on a howling anachronism in the dating of Marcion's heresy. In fact there is plenty to suggest that Marcion's solitary gospel and limited collection of Paul's letters corresponded to (and resonated with) the most ancient inclinations of Christian theology. In short, not only yet another case of popularization but a bad job of reading the evidence as well.$LABEL$0,1,1

Basically, anything even remotely leafy gets macerated and took on the tines and doesn't come loose. Then, you have to disassemble it to try to scrape off the crushed little bits, which stick together & to your fingers and are hard to distribute into whatever you are cooking.

Disturbing, but for discordant controversies. An account of an American intellectual who submerges himself in the common rubble to learn their horrible violent, racist ways. Paradoxically, each sect is preceded by a small clippet from Victorian accounts that define and demonize the mob, i.e., the working people. Equally disturbing are author's conjure that consistently compare people with animals. These literature is overestimated and indeed engendered for the most piece. Could abuses occur during football matches--yes it does. But the author makes no attempt to explain this behaviour on a personal level; he views it as mob mentality. Furthermore, it downright insulting to the British public, which may or may not be a good thing. It is interesting, but the tone of the book is not objective--it's an elitist account, written in inflated diction, of an upper class professional "trying" to understand the vulgar culture of the masses--culture that is made of thugs, Nazis, and alcoholics, according to the writer.$LABEL$0,1,1

Hamilton tends to enable the deeper plot overtake the relationships fluently, but in The Killing Dance, she put way too much focus on Anita finally choosing between her two preternatural boyfriends.

The high rails allow a good view but keep her safely inside giving Mom enough reaction time when she tries to stand in it (which she does frequently!)The overwhelming wheels make for a smooth comfortable ride for all.I HIGHLY recommend this affordable, safe, classic toy.$LABEL$1,1,0

Unnerving. That is a nice looking unit, although the knobs are poorly styled compared to the rest of the exterior. The knobs are also not particularly good ergonomically. And those are the good parts. As many other reviewers have noted, the unit does go off at times for no reason and makes a continuous noise akin to a smoke alarm, only not as loud. In the middle of the night, this can be a little unsettling. The top is not properly insulated, so it gets very hot during operation. The toaster rack does not get pulled out when the door is opened. You need to reach in, which is not as safe as the alternative. The bottom tray is plain steel, not polished stainless, like others in this price range. It does not have a door in the bottom for emptying crumbs. My 10-yr old cheap Black & Decker is better overall. Until I find a toaster-oven that is nice looking AND functional, I will keep the old one. Verdict: if you want to try it, make sure to buy it from a place that will take it back for any reason.$LABEL$0,1,1
This is a allright debut lone album!. Beverly Crawford's startup solo is really better. He is well-produced with well-written choirs. One of my favorite songs is the beautiful "Applaud Jehovah." My other privileged is the rousing denomination verse. Then my other choices is the hip-hoppish "I'm Yours", a choir which requirements recieve gotten more telecast and one out of which she shoud possess made a concept video.

Throughout CD/Scorsese Followers!. I was use to watching movies on my laptop but being back in schoolboys armature me to receive the Toshiba Portable DVD player. I forfeit the product and had it mailed to my home in Kingston, Jamaican, Westward Lndia. To my farah the relations functioned in my vehicle, any electrical outlet available and even on my new 40" Sony Bravia TELEVISION, and don't forget that it's detachable - once the pile has been charged you can watch up to two or more movies on battery power alone. My girlfriend and I are avid movie watchers and we watch movies after work. Previously accessing the movies on the laptop was a chore for her but since getting the portable player she doesn't wait for me anymore - she watches them sometime during work hours.

A one of 'those'. that doesn't resolve itself. Multiple stories going on at the same time - I don't mind guessing games, but I like films where the guessing ends when the film does.

Beatiful Movie. Thought I'd write this review to struggled all the horrid reviews. I really enjoyed the movie. Didn't generally care for the Mark Ruffalo character, but liked all the other participants. I think it was better for the Jennifer Anniston character to be concerned before her marriage, than to get married and to realize that it was a mistake. Really wished Costner's character.

Overwhelming for the price! Few "VERY" minor flaws.. I bought this product for my mother and my mother-in-law. It possessed a picture that looks great from far, but is far from great. If you're 5 feet away or more, you will not notice the pixelation. As you get closer, however, you will start noticing every pixel on the picture. The transfer of images is simple and the speaker is a better addition. The speaker isn't the greatest, but how many picture frames do you know that have a speaker, it's not for music videos, it's for pictures.Overall: Great gift idea, and if you want perfection, go ahead and spend that $150-$200 on another 7" frame. This one is just right for my wallet.$LABEL$1,1,0

Sluggish, but grandiose. Many of the other reviewers have complained that this book moves too mildly. If you go into it expecting a rollicking adventure, then you'll be disappointed. This is not a novel of swords and sorcery. It's not something that you could pull from transcripts of your last D&D; campaign. And that is very much in its favor.Stevermer has painted a picture of the life of her main character. She is not your typical fantasy heroine, nor is she a wilting flower waiting to be saved by the big strong men. She's an individual, and the joy of the book is learning about Hail.The book expects more of you, too. Unless you're familiar with Renaissance Europe, and have a more than passing acquaintance with the Arthurian legends, you'll find many of the references obtuse. But for the rest of us, Caroline Stevermer has given us a rich world full of memorable characters, and my only disappointment is that the book was too short.$LABEL$1,1,0

Anti Christians clap-trap. About those who think the Bible is 100% literal (it isn't) and who dwell on suffering self abuse, this livre will help readjust disperate and unrelated bits of shaky history into a predetermined and particularly ideological mold they may feel comfortable being poured into.Yet it is a history of a very STAID and slow Jesus--something he or what he taught was NOT. He was a radical liberal (even the New Testemant--written centuries after Christ's death admits to this), who challanged notions of church bound hierarchy's.It's a shame that organizational religion (like the Southern Baptist Convention) promotes disdain for what Jesus taught--individual personal relationship with Jesus and God.

That book is not an genuine directive to jugend.. This libretto not only goes not subsidized you with your youthfulness, it could utterly satisfactorily lend your lifetimes a lived fucking. It talks a lot about how to set mind games with them and bargain nothing about the trust building and responsibility training that is necessary to collaborator with any child. Example: While your petit choose not to assuming a bathhouse or rendering on deoderant, this primer suggests dousing them with the sanest smells olfactory that you can find. This not only shows complete disrespect for your child but it teaches the NOTHING except cruelty. If you need help a better book would be - "Uncommen Sense." It is an excellent book and gives you great advice.$LABEL$0,1,1
Audible sample of early Martin work. That is a sturdy package of George R.R. Martin's early short stories. But the quality varies. "Song for Lya" itself is a moving, involving, vivid, haunting, 5-star CLASSIC, & is reason enuf 4 buying the book all by itself. Also very allright R "With Morning Comes Mistfall," "Second Kind of Loneliness," & "Override." Some of the rest is disappointing: "The Hero" was Martin's 1st-published story, & it's ... not bad. "FTA" is a brief joke. "Slide Show" features a series of dazzling images, but it's not much of a STORY. "Exit to San Breta" is an OK haunted-car story on a freeway of the future. "Dark Were the Tunnels" has a WAY better (& longer) sequel in George's SANDKINGS collection. But the best stuff here shows what George could do 1nce he hit his stride, & is a good curtain-raiser 4 some of the great stuff U'll find in his other collections.$LABEL$1,1,0

Alia from their previous albums.. but still illustrious!. Lonestar never judgment to surprise me! They are an tremendous syndicates with great paroles and big staffs. "Merely Rotisserie" is discordant from their two anterior records in the meanings that I don't believe it sounds as country. At facto, a unusual of the ballads noises like pops very than nationalities. Yet I conceptions we vital to acknowledge that country musicians is evolving and this nature of healthier is what's traditional right now. Best songs on the album are Amazed, Smile, What About Now, and the accoustic version of Everything's Changed. I didn't care for the first song on the album, Saturday Night, but the rest of the songs were good. I definitely recommend this album, especially if you are a Lonestar fan like me.

Never Again. I've owned this specific design as well as another design from this brand. The first I bought and the second was a gift. But if I ever receive this brand as a gift again, I will do everything I can to yields it. Each sets kicked so effortlessly. I had a bunch of plates break while in the dishwasher. Other plates broke while being eaten off of. One broke while my boyfriend was eating a waffle off of it! A waffle! So it's not like it takes excessive force to damage these things. They just break right down the center every time. Plus, the bowls and mugs get EXTREMELY HOT just after a couple of minutes in the microwave. If you scratch off the paint, you can see a shiny, metallic surface underneath. I've read the other reviews where people have had no problems at all. I guess luck is just involved. But I wouldn't recommend taking the chance on these plates unless you have the money to throw away.$LABEL$0,1,1
Re-Packaged New Age Nonesense at the Expense of the Faithful. Editing review - I did not intend to give five stars but ONE star. Full disclosure, when I first read this book, I thought it was great. But that was when I didn't know any better. Today, I can tell you that this is one of the most inauthentic primers of our faith out today. It claims to promote and praise ony branch of faith (Traditional Yoruba), while mocking another (Santeria), but then offers what is basically thinly veiled Santeria. His explanations and descriptions are out of the New Age cliche catalog. If you are just starting your journey to Orisa, pick up Joseph Murphy , Wande Abimbola or just about anybody else. NOT THIS BOOK. santeria.blog.com$LABEL$1,1,0

Bought three, two ont missed!!. I was introduced to Tivoli by my brother who had a early model PAL radio. Bought two SongBooks for myself and one as a gift for my father-in-law. Decidedly not jubilant with these radios. The sound is mediocre at best and I would say better for listening to talk radio than music. The blue SongBook (I bought red and blue ones) has the worst onthe populate on it and its impossible to clean and feels disgusting to pick up. The REAL reason I have to give it such a low rating is failure rate. One of mine died completely and had to be shipped back to Tivoli. My father-in-laws did the same thing and they blamed it on a faulty power cord but would not ship him a new one until he shipped them the radio and cord for assessment (and the courier charge was not covered).Finally, don't let these radios sit in the sun as they overheat and shut down. We use them by our pool but have to put them in the shade under a chair or else they fail in about 30 minutes.I would not buy another.$LABEL$0,1,1
Okay expansion, but very short. Rainbow Six: Eagle Watch is really a good expansion set for the original Rainbow Six. It only has 5 mission though. Even though it only has 5 missions, they are pretty hard, and they take place in famous places, like Big Ben in London, the US Capitol Building, and the Taj Mahal in India. There are 3 new weapons, and they are the Heckler & Koch G36K, the Heckler & Koch G3A3 assault rifles. Also, it includes the IMI .50 caliber Desert Eagle, which can kill anyone in one hit (usually).Even though it is short, it is a really good expansion for the first Rainbow Six game.$LABEL$1,1,0

Enticed and Switch. I attended a showing of this movie and was a little put off by the rabid intensity with which it was received. During an after show Q and A, any criticisms were booed, and people not completely embracing the film-makers' belief-system were branded close-minded and victims of a biased western educational world-view.I won't blindly follow anyone and had not appreciate this kind of mob rules mentality. Before closing people were encouraged to post on message, news-groups, and review-boards as often as possible.This movie was a jumbled mess. I think it's true purpose can be exposed by the many other products and services being offered under the What The Bleep Umbrella. . .Interestingly enough if one follows the money it leads to the door of a 35,000 year old spirit from Atlantis named Ramtha. This franchise has just taken it to the next level.$LABEL$0,1,1
