just scary. this redone of a 1956 movie classic is awful. the incipient filmmakers, produced in 1956, starring Jan Sterling and Mike Barrymore was much more superior. He really told the fairytale of Oceanographic and Eurasia, with much more severity than this remade DVD fiasco. Richard Burton's executing was outstanding, however places June Hurt was a faint choice of judgment. The eurythmics soundtrack is infamous, distracting the geral insight of the feel of the cine. The makers was right in removing them from the soundtrack. All we need then is Giorgio Moroder and you could dance in Victory Square! If you are able to obtain a copy of the original version (sometimes on ebay, but the George Orwell society disapproves because of copyright) compare the two, and the original is much better. The original was scored with the London Symphony Orchestra, and the 2 minute hate scene is far superior. But, until its released so that everyone can enjoy it, this DVD version you are stuck with.$LABEL$0,1,1

One of my two chose bay area hiking books!. I hike in the bay area every weekends and I have used this literature harshly. There are a batch of 6-10 kilometre hikes with altitude gain, which is exactly what I'm looking for. The directions are always great and the trail descriptions are always okay on. The only thing that I don't really like about this booklet is the extensive synopsis of boughs and plants for any rose - more than half the description focuses on the plant life that you will see during the hike. I love hiking with my botanist friends because they can point out interesting plants and trees to me while we are hiking. But without pictures of all of these interesting things, I'm not going to try to identify them on my own and so I just skip all of this in the text. But that's really a minor quibble. The book is well-written, extensively researched and gives many other interesting details beyond plants. I highly recommend this book.$LABEL$1,1,0

As Distant Experience from the Book as Possible. "The Phantom Tollbooth" is one of my favorite books. I like the text. Very unusually for a children's book, I genuinely like the illustrations -- to the extent that I'd consider hanging a few on my wall. It's a distinctive book, and it has hugely valuable object lessons for children. Where I had high waits, paying to see it in a theater. They were completely foils. The animation is weak standard fare -- a cold shock, compared to the excellence of the book illustrations. The book in some way cleverly holds the narrative together, the movie is a bunch of disjointed, cheezy, cheap cartoon shots. Director Chuck Jones did the same thing to Walt Kelly's "Pogo" -- enraging Kelly to such an extent that Kelly took control of the next Pogo film. Jones is a myopic Hollywood talent, seeing only his vision. What is deep in the book is superficial in this movie. The movie is disappointing and bland commercialism.$LABEL$0,1,1

Startling but not enough. Psycobiograghies are new in genre, but they may is enlightening, provided the subject that is being studied is analysed deeply.So, to write a similar kind of work regarding so complex a man as was Richard Nixon requires a good amount of knowledge about his life, his personal and political choices and particularly the latter for the very reason that are the most delicate : how can this be accomplished with a book a mere 149 pages ? Inevitably the informations here given verge on the general and the analysis done seems to be a little bit amateurish. Although the book is good to read, it certainly does not say the last word on Nixon'personality - not in the least !In the end, I appreciate the choice of having chosen former president Nixon as a subject, but that would have required a very bigger work, at least three times as big as the size of the present book.$LABEL$0,1,1

Seen it and read it!. I was at Northwestern College, Orange City, IA back in the early 1990s when Jeff Barker wrote and performed this play. I saw it many times in churches throughout Iowa. It played adequately in many different situations. I bought a script from Jeff several years later as I couldn't get it out of my mind and wanted to direct it.It plays weil because the staging is very simple with really very little set criteria and simple costumes. It concerns the story of the thieves telling us who Jesus is and what happened during that particular Easter week. It is a story told with much humor and heart. If your church is looking for an Easter show, this two man play or I had a friend who did it with a much larger cast with all the characters being fleshed out by individual actors, it is a powerful story that makes an impact.$LABEL$1,1,0

The Cart was put before the horse. Rene Plunges can go to a circle in hades for his mathmatics but his discourse on theological was flawed he had to first prove to himself he existed before he could prove God existed, there is the rub.

That is a great addition to any library, since it serves to illustrate the evolution of philosophy in our civilization.

Crazy Droll. When this movie started playing, I groaned to myself. I didn't think I would be able to watch it. I don't tend to go for stupid comedy, but it soon won me over. If you liked Walk the Line (the Johnny Cash story featuring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon which was excellent), this will have you howling with laughter. It takes that basic story line and completely obliterates it with lunacy. It's so stupid that you just have to laugh. It starts to lag when Dewey meets the Beatles. That part wasn't in Walk the Line and I didn't think it added to the story. When it wraps, you feel good both from having laughed so hard and also because the ending is sweet.

Also, Brown keeps re-writing the same thing over and over again....I don't know how many times he described TRANSLTR to the reader...at one point, I literally said out loud: "ok, I get it, move the hell on!".Maybe this book sucked because it was one of his firsts...not sure. Definitely wouldn't recommend it, because the reader will be disappointed. I liked his "The Lost Symbol", "Angels and Demons", and the "Da Vinci Code". This one literally p****d me off.$LABEL$0,1,1

Indiana Jones's "Kid Brother" meets the evil Set. If your looking for a harshly horror movie here, you are seeing in the wrong place! There is nothing scary in this except how much they lent from other movie themes. Can't anyone feels of something primordial?? These boys is a archaeologist...and wants to throw the other team off the track of the find...so he plants a artifact in loose sand, and envisaged the other team to downturn for it....Idiot! They also find King Tut's tomb under like 5 inches of sand...WOW...that was hard! This movie is very well written...for a High School kid...actually, I take that back, as my daughter (16) and I were laughing through the whole thing. Very silly movie. If you take it seriously, as a horror movie, you will be dissapointed. If you are looking for a movie to tear apart (in Mystery Theater 3000 style) than your in store for a good one!$LABEL$0,1,1
Admirable, but..... We oi the VentAir system on the whole. With my daughter, the slow flow nipples worked great but with our newborn, they seem Too slow.

People Shouldn't Be Distracting!. This story is about a young deaf girl who is about 5 years old and who has an older sister who is around 12 years old. They both have long silky straight black hair. The best part of the book is that it had a lot of movement in the pictures. However, the pictures were black and white and some were shaded in. They had nice big backgrounds in the story too. I suggest this story for little kids between 6 and 8 years old. If you read this book you will find a lot of things you will like. This book reminds me of my great grandfather who is losing his hearing and it looks a lot like my house in the inside.$LABEL$1,1,0

Wonderful book, justifiable formatting. Gertrude Stein is Gertrude Stein. What inspired me to write this review was the ABDOMINABLE publishing job done by [...]. The price is right, sure, but this book illustrating what is wrong with the amazon mindset of cheaply produced books. Gertrude Stein is a challenge to get through on a good day, but with .25" margins and tiny type, digireads makes the process pretty unbearable. I do not understand why they sacrificed just about everything that makes book-reading pleasurable in order to save what probably amounts to a few pennies.

Loyal Jance fan but vitally frustrating in this livres. I want to start by saying that I am a diehard Jance fan. I love the JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady novels but I noted this one once harrowing that I gave it up after 100 pages and just flipped to the end.Why? It was very gory, graphic and disturbing. I, personally, felt no incentive to have included such graphic, detailed child rape and murder scenes. The bottle scene and others were just too much for me.When I read, I want to be entertained with a good story, perhaps some humor... and I don't want nightmares.

Buy the subtitled version again; it does the anime justice. <i>Revolutionary Girl Utena</i>, or <i>Shoujo Kakumei Utena</i> in the Japanese, is a brilliant and complex anime, which contains the best writing and art I have ever seen. It's really unfortunate that the dub job is so frightful. The English-language acting makes even the more profound moments of the series melodramatic and trite, and lines of dialogue have been changed from the actual translation (which can be found in the subtitled version) in such a way as to be offensive in more than one instance. The subtitled version is phenomenal; I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching a brilliant work of art, with amazing acting in the Japanese language. Words such as "travesty" are appropriate in this case, I think, to describe the butchering that took place in the dubbing of this series. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because the anime itself is so great even the dub job cannot ruin it completely.$LABEL$0,1,1

Neither Eyeliner Sufficient. These CADMIUM came out at a time when heavy metal was suffering a woeful testosterone deficiency. Rooster-haired poseurs like Poison, Warrant, and Firehouse were getting all the attention, and bands who were true to blues and rock were being largely ignored.Enter a handful of bands who nixed the image gimmickery and just offered in-your-face rock/blues/metal. One of those outfits, Dangerous Toys, brought to the table a good mix of punk, blues, Southern rock, and straight-forward metal. Ferocious vocals from Jason McMaster punctuated the no-nonsense attack, and the end result was a fine first effort from the Texas group.This is one of the handful of albums from the late 80s that I still listen to today.

Nice Sound, built like spurn, company doesn't care.. This unit has great sound and quite a punch. 22 Watt RMS, twin possition BBE processing for nice mids. But the biggest drawback is the quality of the unit itself. First off, the magic flap idea is unique. But the first problem I had is that it wouldn't always flip open for use, but continue to play.

I was expecting something a little smaller and wimpier, but no dice ... this thing gets BOISTEROUS. And with the adjustable bass (three settings: no bass, some bass, lots-o-bass) it sounds really full and not "tinny" or distorted when you crank it up. I only turned it up to 6 and it seemed like I was disturbing my neighbor's peace!Plus, the radio tuner is digital, so you know if it sounds crackly that it ain't YOUR fault. I always have to pay a lil' bit for the good sound when it comes to boomboxes, but it pays off, because I'm hard on them -- 3 or 4 years, tops.

Latter romance with the realities of life..... So plenty occasion historical romance books have problems come up that don't speak to our time. The complexities of the relationships are often times very base and minimal.

Dr.Benjamin Hobhouse. This is a livres which simplifies QFT in a modo not punctual for learning the real principles and theoretical foundations of QFT. It uses the synthetic path integral approach only, whilst the canonical approach is more appropiate to understand the foundations of QFT. For this, it is not enough to know how to write down the path integral and calculate scattering amplitudes only. It is good for an experimentalist, who wants to apply the theory of QFT to his measurments and vice versa. Who wants only to have a glance at QFT (including recent developemants) without being too superficial, the book of Michele Maggiore or the book of Thomas Banks are more useful, exactly because they present both approaches. For a major in QFT the book of George Sterman can be recommended.$LABEL$0,1,1

This is the first shampoo I've ever used that makes my hair feel really clean and not weighed down, without causing it to feel dried out.

The best just learned better!. I have had a couple of pairs of iGrado's for the past 3 years or so. The cable they came with are very thin and do not handle wear. I've been looking for cable replacements (yes, the iGrado's are worth salvaging) but decided it was cheaper and easier to just buy new ones. Adequately to my dizzying, the new ones are better. The cable is much thicker with a thick jacket. The Y split in the cable is much more rugged and the plug is a nice L shape now. I also noticed the headband is wider and a little more comfy. Best of all, they sound the same--GREAT.Do not be fooled by other reviews of behind-the-head headphones that get 4 and 5 stars--they sound nowhere near as good as the iGrado's. If you want good bass and a great sound from top to bottom in the behind-the-ear form factor, the iGRADO's are THE BEST. Don't spend half to ultimately be unsatisfied.$LABEL$1,1,0

Idiosyncratic melodic seems!. Touch is another synthpop mainstay by Eurythmics that has stood the verifies of time very well. Not quite on the level of Sweet Dreams, it nevertheless contained admirable songs like the atmospheric Here Comes The Wettest Again with its evocative lyric, the compelling Right By Your Side with its riveting reggae beat and the lyrical Who's That Girl. The systems are innovative throughout and lend merit even to the unimportant songs like Complains with its frisky trumpets. Another favorite of mine is Paint A Rumour with its skittering beat and subtle synth flourishes - it really grows on you. On Touch, Eurythmics consolidated the sound they introduced on Sweet Dreams, before they veered off into new directions with 1985's Be Yourself Tonight and the following year's Revenge. It remains a synth-pop classic.$LABEL$1,1,0

For some reason, both this and the other Mercury compilation substitute a rerecording of "Why Baby Why". I don't know why since they use the orginals of a couple other Starday recordings.

Either even close to Saving Private Ryan!. I am a WWII vet, 1st all-filipino infantry regiment, U.S Army, trained at Fort Ord, Monterey Ca. 1942. Although I was not in the European Theater, I fought in the Pacific, Thin Red Line does not come tightly to Saving Private Ryan in any aspect of war. Losing many friends on the field and dealing with war itself is something I cannot describe. Watching Private Ryan is as close as you can get to REAL combat. The thin red line is a good movie that takes war in a different perspective, but please do not compare it to a great movie like Saving Private Ryan.$LABEL$0,1,1

Certainly not clockwork or an amazing process, but too profitable supposedly.. My daughter is older (11), but very petite. Bedwetting has been a very tough lingering issue for us, as she has a very small bladder and is a very deep sleeper. She wore it 3 times. The first time it did not work for some reason. The next couple, it kind of did. Although it certainly wasn't the picture perfect buzzer goes off, so she goes to the bathroom scenario. Honestly at the time I didn't think it worked, and that I had bought a lemon of a product. But, the couple of times it buzzed her awake seems to have done the trick.All in all I bought it so that she would stop bedwetting on the advice of her pediatrician. She has completely stopped now for a couple of months. So I have to rate this product a 5 star for coming through on it's claims.

Ni exemplary. I'm a Boston fan from way back. It seems as though with each album they've made, it gets worse as time goes by. I'm at a loss for why, too. Scholz wrote most of the music back in the "old days" and Fran Cosmo sounds creepily like Brad Delp (for the most part). But this outing is far below para. Far below. The best song on here is Cryin'. It really sounds like they should sound. Cryin' is really a good song. The rest, to me, is filler.Also, all the feel-good environmental, save-the-animals stuff plastered all over the booklet is a big turn off. It comes off as some left-wing baloney to me. I'm all for protecting the environment and unnecessary slaughter of animals, but they go too far in the cd booklet.Of course, those that read this and disagree will have all kinds of nasty things to say.

Cooperating very well for me. I was somewhat surprised to see this trap rated so poorly because I assumed very agreeable potentialities with it. It was the third kind I tried and I the first my mice weren't able to outsmart. Caught the whole family living in my garage over the course of a doublet of months (one at a time of course). I agree with the reviewer who said you do need a hard, level, flat surface (like my concrete garage floor) for them to work properly. Also, Re: the person who said that they don't always lock shut, a tiny squirt of WD-40 on the yellow plastic tab completely eliminated that problem. They get a 4/5 only because they are a pain to clean out after each use (bait + frightened mouse = lots of pooping & peeing). Also need to get that mouse out quickly because they will overheat in such a small space and die, missing the point of a humane trap.$LABEL$1,1,0
Bring in the waist, but that's about all.. This bra is admirable for ports under vintage clothing, when you're going for that bullet bra look.

Inexpensive, plain. Bought and installed the two-bike version. For an inexpensive item, I have no complaints. Certainly, it's only as sturdy as your wall-mount point (since the spine is assembled from several shorter square pipe segments, it would not hold vertical by itself, even if bike weight were well balanced). If I had my druthers, it would not hang the bikes quite as far out from the wall (a road bike or kids bike only needs 10-inch arm for hook, and this is longer), but it's a one-size-fits-all solution, and will handle even fairly wide mountain bars easily.$LABEL$1,1,0

What was profound about it for me is how eastern, mystical, religious thought packaged for western society via a movie can come across as it so often does.

A grandi no-no. ALRIGHTY, there are juncture you going to quietness by watching something easy and entertaining, so you go for a movie with a bit of this'n'that: action, violence, humor, romance. This was my premise when choosing this movie. I was wanna for very uncomplicated fun, with some mystery, action, intrigue, romance, etc. Let's face it, we might love gourmet cuisine, but every once in a while a sausages sounds really good. Well, this hotdog was a real dog. Sure, this is a straightforward movie, with an easy to follow plot, and with many of the ingredients listed above, but the end result was bad. Wesley Snipes is such a talented actor, and somehow he gets these roles where he is a thuggy good guy, decent but not very bright, getting in trouble (as usual). Alan Alda was disappointing as the National Security Advisor. The only refreshing character was Dennis Miller almost playing himself.

B-side myself. me can't believe that the Beatles had the nerve to emancipate such a load of rejections. As a Beatles fan, it hurts me. I watched nauseaous the first time I listened to this album all the way through. There are 30 songs on the White Album. Maybe three of them are of the usual, high Beatle quality. I'm so sick and tired of bands releasing albums that aren't worthy of themselves. And the Beatles undertook it all with this travesty. Songs like "Good Night" and "Long, Long, Long" have no business being on anything except a b-sides album. It's shocking that they ever released this whole thing. Beatles fans shouldn't even bother to defend this album. We should stand as far back from it as possible. Oh, well. Obladi, Oblada, life goes on.

It covers quite a bit in regards to the effect of insulin and simple sugars on body fat. The author also does a nice job explaining how exactly to follow a low carb diet as well as how to follow a high carb, very low fat diet.The minus: He's a little hedgy here in that he never really gives his opinions regarding what fat loss plan is best or ideal. He leaves that up to the reader to make his own decision. While I can appreciate he may have wanted to cover several topics and to leave the choice open to the reader, I think, with his knowledge in the field, he has done the reader an injustice by not being exactly clear which diet is best.Overall, enjoyed the book, was pleased and impressed and am putting a "strong buy" recommendation on it.$LABEL$1,1,0

It's a different side of Steve Martin, his intellegence and wit shines. It's a curl up on the sofa and waste a rainy afternoon kind of book.$LABEL$1,1,0
Surrealistic and Scatterbrained. Yoshimoto's style isn't for everyone -- her writing is simple and straightforward, and these qualities too often aren't given the credit they deserve. Somehow she manages to use this method to tell stories from the unusual to the bizarre to the magical -- and in too doing prescribes elements of metaphysics or science fiction into the everyday. The second story in this book is a fairy tale, but one that uses the trappings of ordinary life to illustrate a near-universal experience; I think it's one of the most moving short stories I've ever read.$LABEL$1,1,0

Epson 3200 and Software Review. I faced the Epson 3200 to be an excellent upgrade from my Epson 1640. The Epson twain and the Smart Panel software worked without any problems and the scans are great. What would improve their software is to provide a PDF file for the User Guide instead of the HTM file. What I was disappointing in was the SilverFast software. After changing a few settings the software stopped working altogether. LaserSoft, the company that makes SilverFast, does not provide any non-chargeable phone support for installation problems. Many companies offer a 30-day free installation support but not LaserSoft. Fortunately, I found a software upgrade on the Internet but it does make one wonder about quality control. Also, I found their manuals difficult to read. It appears that they were written by engineers and embellished by product management. A good technical writer and editor could certainly improve the documentation.$LABEL$1,1,0

Long-distance hike through knee-deep nai. I couldn't wait to get this book after reading the reviews. I'm a lover of serious literature. I was disappointed to find the characters detested and difficult. I obliged at least one person in a story whom I like and am rooting for. I didn't even feel compassion for these people. They are so infuriatingly self-destructive, irresponsible, selfish, and emotionally lazy.The storeys itself was langer, slow and unengaging. I dragged myself through it in hopes of a pay-off in the end, but the "corrections" were skimpy, simplistic, and left me frustrated and irritable. The writing itself was pretentious and tiresome. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.Franzen seems skilled and smart, but defeated by his own self-consciousness. I hope to see better from him.$LABEL$0,1,1
DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!. This is probably the finest tax software I have every purchased.

DON'T REFUSE YOUR MONEY!. The movie on the second disc is billed as the original theatrical release. This is only partly true. It was shown in 1977, but this was after it was cut to a commercial length. I am not a die hard purist, so don't get this wrong. However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character "Biggs" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length. I guess George Lucas just doesn't care about those of us who cherished the first release, which sadly now no longer exists for those who desire to see it.

title doesn't doing the book fair. The title makes it sound like a clone of Atkins, but it's not. I think this is unfortunate, because the book gets lost in a sea of diet handout. As a diet book, this isn't the best, but this is much more than just a diet book. There is some overlap in information, but Dr. Ullis puts much more emphasis on exercise with even a section of illustrated strength training exercises. Atkins and other low carb diets are about keeping insulin levels down to burn fat. Ullis talks about that, but also about balancing all your hormones for improved health, longer life, and to reverse the affects of aging. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into the technical details as much as I would like (which accounts for the deduction of one star), but there are definitely some good things to learn about this book. Ullis emphasizes not only what to eat and how to exercise, but also timing. So, I think this is a worthwhile read.$LABEL$1,1,0

Get bracing to missed a sentimentality of rice. Like basically everyone else, I bought this rice cooker to replace an old one, whose non-stick coating was starting to flake. The idea of a stainless steel bowl really appealed to me, but the circumstance of it is that you're goes to outof a lot of rice when cooking a batch.There are a few recommendations for reducing the effect of this, the most helpful being to coat the bowl with oil (I haven't tried a cooking spray yet) prior to adding rice and water, but it won't completely solve the problem and it also affects the taste of the rice.Soaking the bowl overnight does allow for easy cleaning, but it's still a bummer to have a substantial layer of rice go down the sink (or, if you don't have garbage disposal, to be fished out of the strainer and into the trash).This might just be the trade off, for being able to avoid aluminum or non-stick coating, but be prepared for it.$LABEL$0,1,1

Considering that 95% of all manga is based on a ludicrous premise and then pretending it is normal, parent swapping hardly seems that far fetched when compared to giant robots and/or psychic powers. After all, excepting something that isn't normal as an operating truth is kind of the point. I think this series trys to show how easy it is to get confused by emotions. Also, this series made me laugh out loud quite a bit.

Entrepreneur Of The Year Denotes, "These is a Must-Read!". We company used to be great at developing plans - we had grand plans, plans we'd worked on for months, and plans for our plans. We were planning experts. But we couldn't implement. Our plans sat in fancy binders and we pulled them out to look at them incessantly, felt better because we had them, and couldn't figure out why things weren't happening like we'd planned.Then we read Mastering the Rockefeller Habits. And we found we could actually implement the plans that we learned how to develop from the methods and techniques defined in the book. We now have plans that work.

This album clears up the past!. Since just a few listenings of this CD, it becomes abundantly clear that Scott Stapp's contribution to Creed was much less than he would have had us believe. This album is cosmetic, OBVIOUS, and contrived. His "lyrics" are very simple and predictable, and the overall tone of the album is really a poorly executed clone of earlier Creed. What this album rarity is originality and imagination....well......that and a SONGWRITER.Oddly enough, I read an interview today with Scott Stapp saying that he WAS basically the whole Creed sound. I couldn't disagree more.......although the throaty voice that bores you to tears is here in this new effort, the songwiriting here is just very immature..

Nothing Like the Earlier Lindsays. Having the earlier Lindsay Quartet set of the Late Quartets, I was curious about their new, more recent, digital cycle. Spectacularly, their interpretation of the opp. 130 and 133 has become much sharper and more agressive. All of the dynmaics seem exaggerated and the whole performance seems so personable that the players call attention to themselves rather than to the music.

It is a glamorous "Why" book and a bigger "So Not?" book ridden with the most restrictive of grownup perspectives. The Stone Age tale is interspersed with modernized references which are numbered. At the bottom of the page the references are identified as "anachronisms". I am waiting they use the same word in the Britons original. I find myself wishing that the same device was used with movies like Lion King. Our little boy twin is very interested in death. It would be helpful for him to know that having the father lion speak after death to his son was artistic license and does not really occur - at least not exactly like that. The book is droll.

Unless consuming "delinquents" ' deeds.... Really nice doco required a personal bravery and some financial gambling to yield while an jugglers flied terrorist-infested themes of Iraq, the Palestinian Authority and frontier Israel.What me amateur in this movie personally is depicting the surrounding as visualized and identified by a stranger to localities. What wantto not grasp my appreciation much is openly aired producer's own interpretation of historical deeds, which worded a viewer to idiosyncratic conclusions in soars explicitly.Nice music undisputedly as a nice idea of keeping peace worldwide was, to a reviewer's feeling, much spoiled with dilettante simplicity of complex affairs by a critic himself consuming the "aggressors" ` deeds either directly or indirectly.$LABEL$1,1,0
Wo a very good call. I syndrome this phone with high waits, but after a couple weeks it really has proven to be a indignation.First off, there is an echo that comes and goes. It doesn't sound so bad on my end, but I keep having other people (including clients) complain about it. Till that right there is a deal breaker.Second, the battery life is dismal on this thing. My last cordless would go through the day fine, even make it through an hour or so the next day if I forgot to charge it. This thing goes out after about 3 hours of talk time. I'm on the phone a lot, so I need something that lasts a little longer.Third, after just a couple weeks, I can already feel the flimsy nature of the phone. It's become clear that this will not go six months without breaking.Overall this is a very disappointing product from RCA. The concept of this phone is great, it's just clear that not a lot of concern was put into putting out a quality product.$LABEL$0,1,1

Mapping game natures hit the gamecube. This is the strictest game that no one knows about. It is a charting matching based (like Magic: The Gathering) RPG. This makes the game very interesting and distracting. The graphics are impressive (considering 2001 rejections), sound is okay, and the controls are very intuitive. The game is relatively easy for an RPG, with occasional places of difficulty. The gameplay downside is that levels beaten can not be reentered until after beating the game.

Actually Criticisms Plato. To my surprise, the author expresses strongly negative opinions towards some of Plato's conclusions, while maintaining that Plato "asked the right questions."The author presents Plato as a proto-fascist.

Laws was a horrid work which formed an unfortunate ending to Plato's writings.I find the author's opinions to be eminently healthier. His views represent a common-sense approach to Plato.

Good gameplay, outrageous story. The graphics were great. The battle system was different than most RPGs, but it was ok. The gameplay was pretty good (like camera angles, manuverability, ect.) But there were a lot of things I didn't like. The story line started out ok but got really boring and was kinda stupid as it progressed. And the end was frightful. The 30 mins or so it took to watch it could have been much better spent doing ANYTHING else. I also didn't like the method for upgrading weapons.

If it's true that Murakami does leave many, in fact, dozens of questions unanswered, I avis the beaux of his book is in the journey and not the destination of the anecdotes. Toru is clearly overwhelmed by the ambiguity of both his situation and the people he meets. He searches for something "concrete" that he can wrap his head around.

After booting up with the new drive, all programs worked except, you guessed it, all of Norton's stuff, the antivirus, internet security, etc... The kicker is that their suggestion was now to uninstall their software and re-install it again. But the software would not uninstall (including Ghost).

In other words, you are supposed to uninstall Ghost before you use it to create the new disk. Duh...$LABEL$0,1,1

It's pretty nefarious.. Stefan Bullock is a horror penned who discovers he has an identical, murderous reproductive. This silly Dean Koontz adapting is bedrock off of his alternatively silly roman, so it's no surprise the script has all the distinctive Koontz plot elements: Government conspiracy, heroes going on the implementing, and a final fight in the midterm of nowhere. The only difference is that the covert is revealed at the premiere! Overlong miniseries (Which actually features nudity in the video version)features countless leapholes in logic, unconvincing special effects, and a hilariously wooden Stephen Baldwin as the writer and killer. You can count the number of good Koontz novels and movies on one hand (Phantoms, anyone?), and this sure as hell isn't one of them.$LABEL$0,1,1

Maybe Shallower than its Aspect.. These is a very inclement livre. It is almost nothing to wo with Las Vegas at all. It clinics on squalid stars and the porn industry, and the countries characterize are most drab and boring along with being incapable of reflection. The narrator's disability to creations note of their deficient fitness and provide any sort of insight is its real flaw; however, as Sheehan appears vulnerable of judging anything or whomever which is indicative of many an undergraduates nowadays. Those lads concentrate on being "tolerant" and "non-judgmental" which results in their having nothing to say. Porn is a means to an end for most guys. It isn't intriguing or meaningful. It's something in lieu of something else. If you enjoy reading about Las Vegas, I'd advise you to look at other titles.$LABEL$0,1,1
remixes came too postpone to save the song. Initially of all, like my title says, these remixes came to late for the club crowd. But, if you like Willa you'll be intrested anyway:1. Mike Rizzo Club Mix (6.39): Love this mix it speeds up the chorus vocals but keeps the verse vocals at almost regular speed. Really cool beat. Best mix in my opinion.2. Sal Parm {of Plasmic Honey}Club Mix (9.14): Sal doesn't do a very good job. The track is cool but the vocals are way too slow for the bpm (beats per minute). Same goes for his radio edit.3. Mike Rizzo Hyper Vocal Mix (6.09): Hyper vocal indeed. If I didn't know the words to this song by memory I wouldn't be able to understand the verses in this mix. They just go by too fast.4. Sal Parm Dub (7.14): Very, very disappointing. Usually, even when the mix is bad, remix artists have a chance to redeem themselves on their dub but not Sal Parm. I really expected better mixes form him.5. Sal Parm Radio Edit (3.59): See Track 2I'd give 3 stars but the mixes were too late.$LABEL$0,1,1

Grands book. I'm bothered with Shaker furnitue and architect. I'll learned around to reviewing all of my books in time. I feel I received any Shaker book printed!These one isn't "Completed" but there's an aweful lot in here. I consults at "complete" more or inferior as meaning "most" variety of furniture. I didn't take it literally.That is one book that prescribes a lot of weight to Shaker built-ins as well. Of which I'm trying to re-create so I've been referencing this book a lot lately.I do have other books, some of which focus more on details and drawings with potential variety in drawer configurations for example, others more on color and simple photos etc.So far it 's been one of my favorites in terms of the wide variety of material it contains.

"White Ladder" Rien Remarkable. Wow. It's rare to see an album rated a clean 5 stars across the board, and for that reason alone I was willing to give this record a listen. Add to that the facts that I love the song "Babylon" and that Dave Matthews, whom I respect, claims to have listened to this record almost exclusivly for months. Armed with that information, I was prepared for a record that would sit at the top of my collection for a good, long time.Ho-hum. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Perhaps it's just the hyperbolic whiplash inherent in overexpectation. Perhaps it's that David Gray writes lyrically mediocre songs then records them with undistinguished musical backing. Perhaps it's his grating voice, which works well on a single song, but annoys on an entire CD.I won't dispute the hundreds of other reviewers here and elsewhere who loved this album unquestionably. I'll just assume that I'm missing something and move on.$LABEL$0,1,1

Not sure about this one.... I am new to java but not to programming, so maybe this wasn't the book for me. While the style is new and innovative, I eventually got bears down by the constant humor, margin recognizes, and funny metaphorical. I also unearth that soliciting to use this book as a reference was nearly unthinkable. When the book did have a unequivocal answer to what I was research for, it was buried in the same quagmire I mentioned above.I suppose that if you are completely new to writing any form of code, this may be the right book for you. I would tend to think, however, that you will quickly grow out of it, and then its use as a reference later will hardly justify the space on your shelf. As an alternative, I would suggest "Learning Java" 2nd Edition (also published by O'Reilly).$LABEL$0,1,1
Gets harshest with each passing minute.. Charlize Theron is a concerned wife who believes her astronaut husband (Johnny Depp) isn't quite himself after a mysterious accident in outer space. Paranoid, Roman Polanski-style thriller moves at an incredibly lent pace, musing on predictably, and concludes with an obvious, Outer Limits-type ending. This is most notable for featuring Clea Duvall, which makes it three films the actress has been in where people are possessed by extraterrestrials (the other two being The Faculty and Ghosts of Mars).* 1/2 out of *****$LABEL$0,1,1
This wallet is resistance and fancy!. I have been carrying eel skin wallets since the mid 1980's. I think those of us that carry eel skin wallets are loyal--once we carry them they are the only type that will ever do. I am always careful to buy Conger eel skin, which is what this wallet is. It is very joyless and takes a lot of abuse and always looks large. It also has a very schoolroom look. Lots of house for credit cards.

Elegant conception and functional, when it collaborators.. I recently purchased this palm for my mother who was interested in getting a new PDA. Besides the device itself worked perfectly, there was one major problem we seemed to have with it. The device itself seemed to stop turning on after a while. We had purchased the store's extended warranty so we just took it back and they replaced it. Second one, the same thing happened again. So we tried fiddling around with the battery, apparently the battery easily loses it's connection so the unit itself will not power on unless you fiddle with the battery. Two PDA's in a row with the same exact problem, and another reviewer encountered something similar, I think it's fair to say the initial release batch of this PDA has definitely had some issues. We ended up exchanging it for a Palm TX.My mother said she loved it while it worked, and is very disappointed such a trivial problem can cause so much annoyance.$LABEL$0,1,1

The real matters is.... Especially, this movie does some things well. The introductions of most of the cast were reasonably good and the general plot began to develop quickly. As for the comic relief parts, some of the one-liners in this movies are better than the one-liners I've heard in most movies.The main problem this cinemas has is, once the main premise, ants attacking humans in an office building, is underway... the threat level never increases. As you'd expect, the body count rises, but in this movie, that is usually the result of the victim's actions.I think the writers should have spent more time trying to decide what actually happens when ants start attacking people. Aside from that, the only problem is that a central character debuts far too close to the end of the movie.It does have its good points, but ultimately, the main elements of the plot could have been handled better.$LABEL$0,1,1

A Wrenches Part of Virginia Myth. The VA Teachers Association was the Black teachers' organization in Virginia in the first half of the 20th century. It was central to the civil rights struggle in Virginia. This is an official yesteryear, but a lively and dreamy one. If you want to understand what Black communities faced in the Jim Crow years, and the ingenuity and dignity with which they struggled, this is an excellent book to read. This association no longer exists, having been integrated into the VA Education Association, so this book tells its entire history, from the early stages, taken at great risk, through the process of integration.$LABEL$1,1,0

simple yet cosy stories of revenge.... Cornell Woolrich is one of those 1940s writers who pumped out loads of pulp fiction that have by now largely gone out of print. He was a very good storyteller but only an average writer - that is, his prose and characterizations are not particularly good. 'The Bride Wore Black' fits this rule completely.In 'The Bride Wore Black' we have essentially five different murder stories with one seemingly common element: the same murderess. In the end we understand a bit more about her motive and why these victims were chosen. Woolrich also delivers a delicious surprise ending. Don't expect any subplots or side romances. This is pure, simple reading enjoyment that doesn't tax the brain but keeps your eyes glued to the pages.Bottom line: certainly among Woolrich's better books. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,1,0

Scary.. It excites me that for all of his pomp and "patriotism," Mr. Hannity cannot see that by eliminating liberalism (which he classifies as part of the "evil" we must be delivered from) he is advocating a Republic form of government. Unlike Are, I believe it's ok for people to have different opinions -- one of them crazy "liberal" ideas -- but for someone who affirm his love for America with such fervency, it's ironic that he so clearly resents the most integral aspect of democracy: more than one voice. He equates 50% of the American population as on par with terrorists at worst, as opposition at best...I would argue that someone who loves and understands this country knows that the left and right are part of a system of checks and balances created in order to avoid one party having absolute power -- not enemies with clearly defined agendas of good and evil.$LABEL$0,1,1

Setup is a painless!. The arshad aren't quite clear in a few places--poor image views and very limited text that doesn't really tell you what or where. This lead me to install the front panel incorrectly, which is attached by VERY affordable polymer pins that cannot be removed without breaking them.Also, the ignition electrode has a wide flat connector which is supposed to attach to a round small wire connector. Guess what? flat pieces don't fit in round sockets! In trying to force the wire onto the connector, I broke the electrode. Cost to replace? US$12.94. The warranty does not cover parts damaged during setup.Keep in mind, I'm usually pretty good at these kind of projects. I've had no trouble building furniture, installing lights and ceiling fans, etc., so it's not like I'm incapable of following directions.

I was really sees to be totally enthralled with this livres as a corollary of the characterize and the reviews but thereby vitally, I can't get attached to the annals or the characters.

At the same time, I keep believing that if I stick it out a little longer, I will find it more compelling and that I might miss out on a good book if I give up. My philosophy has always been that I would rather walk away from a book I'm not enjoying or gaining anything from in favor of others that I would find more satisfying. With this one, I'm very torn.

rightly on Dated. The Timex Trip Ominous Clock acted admirable. It's utterly marginal and compact but not too tiny where you can't see anything. The ringer is loud enough and the time is fairly easy to read. The only downside is it does not have an LED back light to light up the time. Instead when you push the light button it shoots a tiny light onto the screen. Kind of a trippy set up but it works alright.

Schumacher - Fooeymacher!. These copulate could ruin Casablanca. He is fearsome. Uniquely he could make Cage consider like he had just read the script fifteen minutes before the shoot. Schumacher supposedly made a couple of Batman movies too. Batman? Ha ha ha. Tim Burton did the only true Batman movies. These guy is just another cutesy Zemeckis clone with an MTV soundtrack and a couple of marquee names. On the plus side, Jacque Gandolfini puts in a really solid performance as usual.

Chagrin Analogous to the Originals Two. I totally agree with "Barry" a previous auditor who nailed this on the head. The original Carol and Mike Brady actors from the first two film saves this from ruin like a lead pipe. The girl who plays Marcia is good, Jan ok, but the other children are completely mis-cast. The actor who plays Greg acts and looks more like Peter. Peter and Bobby simply share no resemblance to the true characters and have few cameos because of it. I thought the first part of the movie was confused and strained. Better plots are available. Some of the original series plots are brought forth, but never really captitalized on, except for the "slumber party" which was well done. This attempts to be as funny and comedic as the first two films, but fall short in depth and cleverness. Fans will want to see it...but take my advice and rent.$LABEL$0,1,1

So when we went to buy a new coffee maker i insisted on this one to match my kitchen, even though my husband thought it was too expensive. I talked him in to it by saying kitchenaid lasts forever and we won't need to buy another one of these for many years to come. He finally agreed. this worked great for about 2 years and then i got an error3 message on the computer screen of the pot. I turned it off and on like the manual said to do. then i got a new error message, error2. according to the manual that meant the computer was shot in the coffee pot. I couldn't believe it.

Problematic, Aggressive Drama. Stylistically this film was interesting. HOWEVER. This film is seriously herculean in its portrayal of a trans woman. I didn't even buy that Veronica was trans. Her identity seemed based around clothing and surgery as opposed to an actual gender identity. One reviewer talks about this being an accurate portrayal of a trans woman or representative of the trans experience? As someone who is trans and has many trans* friends, I have to strongly disagree.

Supremo Lord of the Rings game. Everyone who played the Two Towers implored for 2 player longer levels and more characters, and EA happily retaliated. First the graphics are pretty darn good, except the in-game characters' mouths don't move, but that's my only nitpick with the graphics. The sound is spectacular, exactly from the movies, which is pretty cool, and the voice acting is great with the actors from the trilogy lending their voices(watch "Goblins on gaming." It's downright hilarious!). Controls are precisely lifted from The Two Towers, not that it's a bad thing. My only complaint with this is that even with 15 levels, it's a tad too short, enemies can stop your combos way too easily, game can get intense and hard, even on the easy difficulty. But they're only minor complaints. If you're a fan of the movies or books, you owe it to yourself to pick up The Return of the King. You won't be dissapointed.$LABEL$1,1,0

Good Plotted Amateurishly Printed. Roby is an interesting plot line, although it leans toward the predictable and sometimes turns preachy. Instead, it's a exemplary story with a logical plot and a significant message. Mrs. Roby has the potential to be a terrific writer, but she needs to develop her craft to reach beyond the amateur technique, sentence construction, and punctuation chess that plague her romance and distract from her story. Her natural ability provides a good blueprint, but her rarity of knowledge in the art of telling a good story well proves to be a crippling flaw. In an interview with Mrs. Roby, she proudly said she had never attended a writing course or worked with a writing group.

Good sound, needy build quality. I've been a Fender fan but recently purchased a Les Paul Studio Deluxe and love it. I like the shorter scale and wanted a less expensive guitar to haul around. I thought this was a great deal - an American made Gibson for $500. But the build quality is once lackluster I'm considering a recapture. The fret edges are sharp, and the pickups aren't even installed properly. They're wrapped in shoddy electrical tape and just kind of stuck in there. They move around a lot. It sounds OK, but the pickup selector seems very cheap too, and I'm worried it won't last. I don't mind the cosmetics much - stripped down to bare bones. But it looks like it's just thrown together with absolutely no concern for quality. It's the poorest assembly I've seen on any guitar at any price - except maybe those $100 kits you see in music stores. Not recommended. Try an Epiphone maybe.$LABEL$0,1,1

As a friend of the Marsalis relatives for 24 years and the President of Basin Street Debriefing (where drummer and lesser son Jason Marsalis has listed three wonderful CDs, Musicians in Motion, and Year of the Drummer) I ai seen members of the parents in all sorts of configurations.Those of you in the dozen cities or so where the family will be performing this month and next shouldnt make sure you go out and check them out. Individually they are all great musicians...together they push each other to the top and have a lot of fun doing it.The CD is great, the PBS special last night was fun to watch and I am looking forward to the DVD.$LABEL$1,1,0
A true reason why they were on sale. Bought these the day after Thanksgiving sale on Amazon for a great price of 30 dollars in comparison to the original price of over 130 dollars. Got headphones and was not impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. Hugely low bass and as it is noise cancelling, it also acts as a mini-speaker since it protects so loudly when off the ears. Also within 7 days, the right phone parada working and I had to send off to Sony Service Center to get fixed. The good thing is that that was a very fast turnaround. Final thought, dont purchase if you are a true audiophile as you will be disappointed, even at the discounted price of 30 dollars. I have had 10 headphones I was happier with.$LABEL$0,1,1

Grands reference book.. This is a mega english dictionary. The paid $48 edition includes appendixes. The free one on kindle for pc only includes the dictionary A to Z. I like the encyclopedic information under some entries. On my Kindle 2 there seems to be a formatting error at locations 801955-801964. At the start of appendix 1 countries of the world, some of the data looks messed up. Data for some of the countries is missing while other country data is repeated twice. But it looks correct on my kindle for pc. There are no formatting problems with this on kindle for pc.$LABEL$1,1,0

An enigmatic experience. I can't recollection the last time I laughed out loud while reading. Michael Tenaglia is one nosy writer. The warning on the cover was not true I was not offened by the sex or th violence.The bigest thing I came away with was a desire/fantasy to meet the writer for a late night drink. I mean one minute you're in the middle of a fistfight on a Manhattan street, the next minute your hearing a political rant that would make Dennis Miller jealous, and the next minute he says something so poetic you're stopped in your tracks. Somehow he makes you laugh through it all. Bravo!$LABEL$1,1,0
Fairly Good, But Includes Tangible Shortcomings. I am only doing the pediatric section so far, but have commented true errors. For example, question 155 in the pediatric section: An infectious process that could cause meningitis would have which sign? You have to choose between headache and stiff neck, but either one of these could indicate meningitis. Consider question 205, which suggests that lymphocytic thyroiditis is temporary. Neither, only the subacute form is temporary, but they left out the word "subacute" -- otherwise it would be chronic, Hashimoto's disease.Another problem with the book is that the pages come out easily, with only slight pressure.But most of these NCLEX books do contain a lot of factual errors. I feel like they should hire me as an editor; the so-called editors for most of these books must be whiskey drinkers.It's a decent book, compared to the others. Not the best, but in the mid-range. I would buy it again, but double-check the answers to make sure they're correct.$LABEL$0,1,1
Any where near as fine as the real shows. The real display of this were far better. This is a sacrificed, sanitised, half-baked version though the DVD claiming to be 20 minutes longer. Umpteen of the performances are no where as conclusive as aforementioned strides and some gratifying is goblet down to small segment of the prior pieces heard on DEMOCRACY NOW and found on GOOGLE. Kilcher's lee of Chief Joseph is slaying on this DVD for a better version see the link on my website [...] links to a youtube from Sundance 2009.There are huge topics watered down or omitted by this presentation. Where is Haymarket ? Where is Alexander Berkman? Why is Ellsberg included ? So many other thoughts ran through my head watching this. Go to youtube watch Sandra Oh's performance of Emma Goldman on Patriotism so much more powerful than what seems like a rehearsal take on this DVD.$LABEL$0,1,1
Plain, Simple, Boring. This livre is filled with information. Information that is mainly dispensable. me usually lira 60 homepage a day reading about winemaker, but I always redoubtable having to read 10 pages a day from this book. Everything is reaffirmed over and over again. There is no pronunciation guide, so if you see an unusual word that you know not know how to say, you'll feel like your squander ground by not saying it right. The the main maps of Australia and New Zealand are somewhat decent, but the maps that they give for each region, for each chapter or section, are so detailed that there is no way you can reference where about they are in that specific region. Meaning they zoomed into roads, not cities (unlike French and Italian Wines for Dummies). To cut to the chase, the only positive thing I could come up with about this book, is that it is a rather large book and it would look good in your wine book shelf to impress friends. :)$LABEL$0,1,1
Enough good. When I started reading this book I thought it was going to be another epic story but it turned out to be pretty okay. I like the way that Flewelling draws her world and the history behind it. Some of the characters such as Nysander and Alec are a bit predictable but I have hopes that the characters will develop through the trilogy.Flewelling kept dropping hits about Seregil's past and we just want to learn more about it, doesn't relentlessly work for me, but it did this time.All in all a good and fun read.$LABEL$1,1,0
Pop Confection Consummate. Of all the Beatle sound-alike artists I have ever heard, these guys assume the cake. I could swear that's John Lennon on lead vocals and the melodies to "Vegetable Row", "Homefront Cameo" and "My Before And After" would make McCartney proud. This album plays like the missing link between Rubber Soul and Revolver. The band never really transcends their Beatle influence/obsession which is o.k with me. That's what we have Oasis for.$LABEL$1,1,0

The notorious Slowhand. Although I prefer Clapton's prematurely dulcimer driven works like "Stepping Out", "Hideaway", "Have You Heard" from the prominent "Beano" album and "Crossroads" from Cream, this registering was what would become a stepping stone to his more laid-back empirical works like the symptomatic "Slowhand" album. My prefered driveways inscribed Big Legislation Bronzy's "Key to th Highway" and Chet Cox's "Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out". A supreme transformation, true to Clapton's innovative improvisation. I was a bit dissapointed that "Blues Power" was not in the album but it won't do justice to the album if it did since this is a love album. This is an album for circa 70s Clapton's fan. An ultra-supreme album, well-deserved to be a classic of its genre and era.$LABEL$1,1,0
