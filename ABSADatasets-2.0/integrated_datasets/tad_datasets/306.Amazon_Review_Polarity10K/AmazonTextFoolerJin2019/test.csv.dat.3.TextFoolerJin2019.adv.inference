Read 'A Good Man is Hard to Find' to understand this movie. This movie is a grisly fairy-tale, Little Red Riding Hood with all the gory details of the wolf's attacks and his death by axe. The child is the key to the story. The violence is so exaggerated as to be a horrible parody. The line the male killer makes (who has no name by the way) at the end about the little girl is everything. A very dark comic parable. Don't take its over-the-top violence seriously.$LABEL$1,1,0

It keeps springing back to "ON" position, and doesn't click to stay "OFF." I considered returning it, but when I checked the floor models at local stores I noticed that they didn't work either.

Scandle, coitus, and distracting. I never really was all that interested in the whole Henry VIII thing but I was given this book and just started reading the first couple of pages. It really has a way of engaging you from the start. In the beginning Mary is only a little girl involved in this larger than life role she has to play. You follow her along with her exciting residing, and just when things start to cool off for her, you become fixed on her sister. I loved reading how nasty the author made her. I know there are legends of how Ann really was a royal pain. The author did a good job playing it up. It really is quite long over 650 pages, but you wouldn't know it, I read it in 6 days. Its really a page turner. It really only portrays Ann, and Mary in depth, and I liked that. I also liked how the author depicts an aging, baby of a king who likes to get his own way. In the end the author does an amazing job wrapping up the looses ends to the already known facts making this history/fiction story a great read.$LABEL$1,1,0
A mainstay. Of course he never wrote an autobiography, but if he told it to cronies, it would sound like this, then he'd have them shot. So imagine Stalin telling his life story, a crude thug boasting of his power, telling little anecdotes about exterminating millions, and sharing his innermost "thoughts". It's black comical at its best. Lourie is a sovietologist and literary translator from Russian, he's done the research, spent time in Russia, he knows his stuff. It's hard to imagine a more accurate portrait of the monster, and once you start reading, you can't put it down. Should be required reading, lest we forget. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,1,0

A dismal tale of a young Irish-American Boy .. This book by Dennis Smith is a allright prequel to his Engine Co. 82. In 82 we saw a young man dealing with the job he has chosen for himself, and a difficult job that was. In Song for Mary we see the boy who became that man. The only way a man could become a fireman is if he had great compassion for humanity. Mary, his mother, gave him this compassion. The "Song" of the title resonates throughout the book with the haunting refrain of The Rose of Tralee. I thought this memoir was as good, if not better, than those of Frank McCourt and others which have filled the bookshops recently. A MUST-READ for anyone who cherishes their Irish-American heritage or if they came of age in New York City,$LABEL$1,1,0

All sheet, no ghost.... This lavish-looking French generating, while it does provide simmering atmosphere by the kettle-full, falls perfectly succinct in the story department, supersedes fill-in-the-blank visual stereotypes (treading heavily on del Toro's turf in particular) for narrative/dramatic cohesion at nearly every turn. Dialogue and acting are also subpar. It reminded me, as such, of Anthony Hickox's 2010 'Knife Edge,' another attractive but creatively malnourished Euro-natural potboiler.

Emphatic book on Java networking. The book covers sundry topics. For background material, it covers TCP/IP theory, security, threading, exceptions, and streams. In the actual networking part of the book, it covers client-side and server-side networking, URLs, datagrams, multicasting, RMI, CORBA, Servlets, and Message Streams. In other words, there is a wide range of topics covered.The book is full of actual code examples. I especially enjoyed one like the finger client and the dns client. These are real world examples that will be extremely useful if I ever need to implement these protocols using Java.One error that I noticed was that it mentioned that the source code from the book was available from two web sites. In reality, at the present time, it is only available from the first one mentioned.Overall, it is a book that is worth owning and has the broadest coverage of any of the Java networking books on the market.$LABEL$1,1,0

Nicole Whitehead is sexy too, but her scenes aren't as good as some of the other girls. Coleen Marie is rather sexy with good scenes. Tailor James and Stephanie Glasson aren't bad, but they fall far behind Hiromi and Pilar in my book. I never watch any of the other girls besides Hiromi, Pilar, Nicole, Coleen, Tailor and Stephanie.

But I believed it really started going south when the mechanized soldiers showed up in New York and Our Heroes just happened to coming there! The Liberal-Conservative conflict at the base of this story was hard for me to resolve in the beginning. Not because Card wasn't beating me over the head with it but because I kept thinking there has to be more to this story. It was an easy read so I kept at it. The afterword says Card wrote this as the setting of a video game. Well, I guess it was plotted like a video game. I don't really know anything about Card's politics. He comes across as a right wing nut case in the afterward which explains the right wing nut case conspiracy theory of the book.$LABEL$0,1,1

No wonder this has been discountined. I'm a creature of habit, so I kept buying this specific earpiece for my cell phone, since I liked the way it was designed. Small, simple, and I didn't have to look like someone from "Star Trek" with that dumb thing blinking in my ear. It works well, and has excellent sound quality both for my voice and the earpiece. What I liked is there is this rubber "hook" that keeps it in your ear, and is very comfortable. However, every one I've bought (and I've bought a lot of them) has the same problem which is the "hook" breaks off no matter how gentle you are with it. So then you have to sort of stick the earpiece in your ear, and hope for the best. For a while they were very cheap so it wasn't that bad, but now they are hard to find.

Didn't labour for me. I bought this pan because my cat squats right inside the door to her regular covered litter pan, hangs her downstairs over the edge, and pees on the floor. I bought a pan with a high side but she still can't keep everything inside. me sufferance the Clevercat design would impede spillover, but Ginger just bypassed the middle step and peed directly on the floor when confronted with this product. I tried it both with the top off and on, and it didn't seem to make any difference. It looked like a good idea, it just didn't work with my cat. FWIW, she's sixteen years old - a younger cat might take to it more readily.$LABEL$0,1,1
No real plot. I loved all the book in the A. Blake range until this one. The other reviews that gave weaker ratings have already explained the subjects with this groundbreaking and I don't would to repeat it. I strive two times to read this book and executive to reads semester only. His is however nefarious with no plot and the usually charming specification (Brenda, Jean-Claude, Richards) have turned into perverted psychopaths, completely likable. I wish I never booting this book and only kept the earlier as a pleasant memory. I wont even look at any more books from this author.$LABEL$0,1,1

Unimpressed. That is not Wolinsky's best actions.Outset, it needs considerable modification.Second, this is just a re-packaging of the current pop psychology thinking. Wolinsky adds to the misunderstanding by adds another factor. Even of YOU caretaker out on remiss entreat, Wolinsky constitutes 'House Child' and 'Hypnosis'... accordingly NOW the Inland Babes HYPNOTIZES you into acting out on instinctual commits.What's his reaction? The same as the old psycho-analytic approach: awareness. When you can become CONSCIOUSLY aware of the processes and the relationships then *poof* they are resolved!I was disappointed that this "Quantum Psychology" expert put so little thought or effort into this book. If you have any education in the area of psychology, this is a waste of your time.$LABEL$0,1,1
That book possesses been around for someplace but it instead pertains dated. The author of this handbook is 1985. I wasn't safe how it would apply to today's iife. I am 51 and bribed the book as personas advised me about it. I wasn't confident that I was a woman who "loved too plenty" but solicited to contemplate for myself. This textbook is an eye opener. I see how I live every dated as a mesdames who loves too large and how I am making myself unhappy every day. I love the book but it hurts a little to see what I'm doing to myself.$LABEL$1,1,0
Alright little whistling smelters. This whistling tea kettle heats enough water to make two 12-oz cups of tea, hot cocoa, etc. The whistle starts as a cute little chirping sound as the water begins to create steam, then progresses to a rather loud, sharp whistling that you just can't ignore. The easy-fill opening is very nice, too. Don't overfill, though, because you'll end up with a hot, wet mess on your stove top.$LABEL$1,1,0

Great movie, just couldn't watch it at home. I guess I missed the fine print about the format of this particular dvd. I was unable to play it on my home dvd player. So, I lacked my moneys.

Longue and Priceless. This is the first of six kits, each equally priced. I found the method to be fraught with language cues that were too syrupy to swallow ("popping above the line", "solution sandwich", "lifestyle surgery", and "tender morsels"). Doing cycles are at the heart of the program, a process that, for me, lent itself more to manufacturing emotion vs. excavating damaging shadow beliefs. I shut up overturning out, and feeling much better for it.I'd recommend saving your money on this one. Try Martha Beck's Joy Diet instead.$LABEL$0,1,1

Expensive fan in a letterbox. The commodities description does not make it clear, but this operative is not a digital saleem generate. It's just a inhale in a box with three dexterity define (high and very high) and some bevels that you can adjust. The two settings are very similar, and for many people this will mean that the lowest setting will not be quiet enough, or the highest setting will not be loud enough. This is a lot of money to pay for a fan in a box, and I wish I could get my money back. I recommend the Sharper Image sound generator, instead. It has a volume knob as well as options for selecting different types of background noise.$LABEL$0,1,1

Almost a livre to interest a person who thinks for himself.. When we talk about Kirby Godsey, let's be honest. The author has a long way to go to reach someone who has thought beyond the preachments of Southern Baptists and others. I suppose some case could be made for this work to be compared with Tillich's "The Shaking of the Foundations," which didn't shake any foundations to my knowledge, though some found it interesting. Another book from the past comes to mind, "Your God is too small." I guess I just don't feel the need of anyone else telling me what God is really like or what the Bible really means or what should be going on in the churches. The rampant confusion on matters religious is well beyond the ability of Dr. Godsey to say anything of any real importance. Godsey's own denomination is one of the better examples of the confusion of which I speak.$LABEL$0,1,1

Satisfactory for dismount upper lip/chin hair. I charades I'm going against the multitudes and was to chitchat I like this product adequately a bit. It's not perfected but it contributes me bringing off most of the toupee on my top lip and the slight hair on my chin.The only awry thing about that is, if you permitted the cream on for more than 8 minutes, it purposes to sting for an hour or two after wiping off the kreme. Even if the hair comes off around 6 minutes, please happily do so!Tip: BE SURE TO USE WARM MOIST PAPER TOWEL. It'll help with removing the hair. :)$LABEL$1,1,0

deeply succinct and the real step is disappearance!. After seeing NOVA: the day the earth shook, this is a real bummer. That's why I recommended the nova tape FURTHERMORE of this, read my NOVA review to know why.That video only contains news footage of the CONSEQUENCE of a Californian quake. No actual earthquake footage, just footage of the damages, for only a short 30 minutes. Interesting here and there, (so called earthquake safe highways, weren't earthquake resistent after all) but not worth the money, in my opinion.$LABEL$0,1,1
