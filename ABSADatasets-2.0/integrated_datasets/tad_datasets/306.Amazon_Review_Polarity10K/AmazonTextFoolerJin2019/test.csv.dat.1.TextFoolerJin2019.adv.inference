Foreign talent wasted in American film..

Examples: Planet of the Apes, Time Machine, and lets not forget how they destroyed The Day the Earth Stood Still! Anyway, it jumped all over the place.

Starts out good, doesn't latest. I liked my first Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse I bought a year ago to use with my laptop so much that I bought two more within the last six months, one for my desktop and one for my business use laptop. The mouse has great features, I liked the small "tail" and the especially the fact that the tail can swing to multiple positions to accommodate other USB plug-ins. However, that swinging tail doesn't arise to chocks up for long. All three of our mouses (mice) are experiencing the same problem with losing connectivity to the PC, we can wiggle the tail or turn it to another position and it may, or may not, light its little green "good to go" light.

Beautiful stickers, but not sustainable.. My enterprises consumes over 50,000 of stickers of this size a year so I have precisely a bit of experience with them. These stickers are higher quality in every respect. They print very well and maintain what was photocopies on them without smudging or other problems. The simplistic peel thing is very nice and could help with efficiency in applying stickers.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not continue requisitioning stickers. The adhesive on these provokes a reasonably strong bond, but will pull off. It appears they are designed to do this. I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.

I am more to blame than Jordan. I was vacationing in Kenya when I finished "Eldest" and needed a new book desperately. The only primer of attention I discovers a bookstore in Mombasa was Intersecting of Twilight. For some reason I do not remember, I read all previous 9 books in the Wheel of Time epic (and I used that in the negative sense). So I place the reproach squarely on my shoulders for reading such an fearsome manoel.Jordan creates a fascinating world, but after Book III, he gets lost in his own story. Honestly, and without exaggeration, there is not ONE plot development in this book. Yes, that's correct: not one thing of importance happens in the 800+ pages. Unfortunately, that has become the norm for Robert Jordan. If you just have to finish this series (I am officially at the "I could care less" stage), do yourself a favor and skip this book and go on to Book XI.$LABEL$0,1,1

Full of kidding. Blackmailer overflows with colorful characters and a suspenseful plot with a well done twist at the end. The protagonist is a publisher in a down and out New York shop who is offered the chance to publish a sure fire best seller which would catapult his firm into the top ranks.Twice. And that's just in the first few chapters.After that, we get the usual goons, gams, and gunsels so popular in 1950's noir. However, there is a lot more here than just a clever plot. The author understands the publishing business and wiretapping quite well, and the reader will learn a bit about both in several well-turned passages.The plot moves quickly enough to keep us from not questioning it too much. The profusion of unusual characters keeps the book interesting all the way through. And just when we think we know what's going on, we get another twist.This is not great literature, but it is a fine way to while away a rainy Saturday afternoon.$LABEL$1,1,0

But, I liked that it had a different flare. This is not my favorite in the series but I wouldn't have missed it! Don't compare this series to others! This is the type of mystery where you lean back, kick off your shoes, grab a bon bon, and enjoy a fun and entertaining story.

Sometimes the coffee is great but then I've had several times when only hot water has come through. The coffee filter holder is very hard to fit into the machine.

Value it. I picked up "To Shoot A Monarch" at a movie rental plaza one nocturne when I was just exploring (as unremarkable) for something more than the function/crude comedy/horror that so often channeling the trays of the latest spilled. The storeroom holds only one or three copies of this one and so I thought I'd picked a consults. I was pleasantly surprised to chitchat the least. Since that night, I purchased the DVDS for my possessed compilation and have shared it with a few people who all liked it as well. I've watched it several times since I bought it and will watch again I'm sure. It's not often that I want to see any movie more than once or twice in a year but this one is definitely worth it, I think.$LABEL$1,1,0

defective DVD. Movie is excellent after I bought the DVD it would just play up to scene 14 and skip to the end..they replaced it and it was the same thing.. I finally had to go rent the movie and watch it...strong performance by both actors...movie is a ***** (five star) but not on DVD$LABEL$0,1,1
Never a fan of Bel Ami. No matter how many photo books I buy, BelAmi will always rank number 1 with me. The photos are always clean and crisp with the most beautiful youthful men.$LABEL$1,1,0
This book is puzzling.. I reads the making of the atomic bomb by the same author and remianed fascinated for 800 pages. That book is equally marvelous. The previous book dealt with the advances in science and the people who made them, beginning in the 19th century. The hydrogen bomb was conceived during the epoch subsequent to the making of the atomic bomb and its promoter, Edward Teller, was not a popular person at the time; he encountered resistence. The authors describes the personalities who were working on these weapons, famous scientists, and their quirks and weaknesses. Also, all of the science that goes on. I did stop to study a bit.$LABEL$1,1,0
Very bummed. My 8 enjoyment longtime sons takeover the RipStik with his saving and I we dissing it. He is bestest with skater and skateboarding but can only torre this a twinning of legs. I read the reviews on Amazon and nationals said the product was great and how fun it was. He has aspired to ride it and cannot have more than a rare foot. I definitely been not applauds this product for a kid. It exposes 8 and up but I would not even consider it unless they are in their high teens. I am very disappointed that he spent so much money and cannot ride it. The wheels spin forward and backward and in a circle at the same time. I tried to stand on it and had to hold the counter to keep my balance. It is very hard to balance because of the way the wheels spin. Would never buy this again.$LABEL$0,1,1
second-hand and too imbibed. His actually is of little cannot to a listening how long and why this outfit kept in the shade. This album will, for all we know, put them away for longer still. Reason is a-plenty. To begin with, neo-romantic synhty-pop is not quite making hey these days. The material smacks of Wet Wet Wet's heydays. And anyway, this sort of nagging suicidal gloom is too much to bear in A-ha, Weeping Willows, Doves and the entire Glitterhouse label's output. On the plus side we have here 11 cute and crafty tune arrangements - but then again, vaguely reminiscent of 80's new wave era which Erasure never failed to subscibe to. Wake up, little Suzie, wake up!$LABEL$0,1,1
Perversely Uplifting. I am trying to be frugal with my five star reviews but this album deserves full marks without question. Judging by my screen name, one can safely assume that I am a Will Oldham fan. I, myself not being much of a writer, will avoid trying to pin this album down with my words but direct those interested to reviews at both pitchforkmedia.com and nme.com.$LABEL$1,1,0

hahaha,,,take a enacting. I have to say that Mos kinda crapped out on this one. I was expecting a lot more out of this album than what I got. The album is ok, but I wouldn't go running around telling people to buy it. I stlll will enjoy Mos on other levels,,,specifically I against I, a track you can find on Daddy G's album. That track is amazing. Sorry Mos, you should of worked harder on this one$LABEL$0,1,1
Not too bad, but nothing much really. Still don't achieves me wrong here. It's a great movie, well a good movie. But this isn't the movie, it's the comic book.The problem is, it IS the movie! There is nothing here that stands out on it's especial from the movie and all the other hype. It's a good movie, but it's not a best comic book in it's own right.Or to simplify further, it'd be better if there wasn't a movie, because this is just the movie on paper (well, a movie on paper is a script, but you get the metaphor). If you've seen the movie, don't bother. If not, go ahead.$LABEL$0,1,1
Adopt on the '06; you'll compulsory the '07 by the seasons it arrives. I ordered this calendar as a Christmas present for my friend at the beginning of December with a shipping estimate of about the 16th of December, and the 16th of January is approaching and it still conceivably has not envoys. In my opinion I should receive 1/12th of it for free since my friend won't be able to use the January page; along with a complimentary Christmas knack for next year. But instead I decided that I would do the world a favor and save them the embarrassment of wrapping and giving an empty box with an IOU note as a gift. You can't use an IOU note to keep track of the date. So please do ME a favor and pass on this calendar no matter how attractive you think an actor might be. They're not very attractive when they're stealing your hard earned greenbacks, think about that. Oh and by the way I've also been forced to give this item one star of which it doesn't deserve since to my knowledge it may not even exist. Thank You.$LABEL$0,1,1

CONFLAGRATION........ me am sorry to claimed this takeover was a total discard of treasuries. I accept some of the culpa. I purchased this game not knowing that it was actually an ADD-ON game to an early version of "Combat Flight Simulator". I purchased Battle of Britain as a stand alone game...this obviously was not going to work. Having instituted the package and reading the directions I thought that it may work as I do have Combat Flight Simulator 3. This is not the case... Now the game required is no longer available, so I am left with a game that is absolutely useless. I emailed my issue to Amazon and was informed that I could return the item but having destroyed the packaging and the cost of returning the game to the USA, I chose not to do so.I guess it's a case of "buyer beware" and make sure you understand all the instructions.$LABEL$0,1,1
It Does Spark. When it comes out of the box and I first start using it, the air is powerful but definitely not hot enough. So the more I have used it over some months of time the hotter it has gotten, which I really like. But the last few weeks I have noticed some sparking. Freaks me out a bit! I have been buying this brand for a while and my previous ones just shut down after about a year but this ones sparks. Time to buy another blow dryer I guess. Sparking from an appliance is never good.$LABEL$0,1,1
Bad. So So Bene Bad. And not in a campy good way.. Lately transports and while positioning ledgers back on the bookshelf, absconded across this one. Can't mentioning if I takeover it or elses carried it to me ... equally stole it for my railway commuted readout.UNRECOGNIZABLE. Atrocious despicable. Is this "announced" by a presumption or remuneration presse? I cannot behold any editorials flee through this. Further tasteless. Worse than teenager high journal entries I used to correct.Hope the author kept her day job... and also hope she used a pen name to protect herself.

appallingly bizarro!. wow, this book was sooo jest! This book is about a teenage boy, whose mom is a stripper at a sleezy club. He's completelly ashamed of his mom, so he doesn't tell his girlfriend. He is a typical teenage boy; very insecure. His only real friend is a girlcrazy self acclaimed doctor. This is all until he meets his future girlfriend. She's beautiful, and new to the school. When he finally gets the courage to ask her out, she automaticlally says yes.He finds later, that he really loves this girl, and he can not keep the secret about his mom. Him and his girlfriend broke his virginity, and did everything together. This book is better for teenagers, because much of the subject matter is "unsutible for young children" lol$LABEL$1,1,0

NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS. If reasonably well-executed, this CD is performed, in its entirety, by the BB Band, apparently a studio group. This fact is not clear from Amazon's description. In fact, Amazon lists it as "Various Artists". The CD itself does not let you know it's by the BB Band on the front cover. It tells you on the side and on the back, in very fine print. I assume people looking for these songs are also looking for the original artists--they should not buy this album.$LABEL$0,1,1
