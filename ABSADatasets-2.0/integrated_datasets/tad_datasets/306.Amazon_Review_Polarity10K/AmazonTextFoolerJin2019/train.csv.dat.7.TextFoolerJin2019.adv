Real Men Read Iron Jane. This book assumed been recommended to me for years. Potentially, at the recommended of my samuri sword educators, I picked it up and read it in long sittings. What me like first and foremost about Iron John is that it jumpsuit memoir, converter, poetry, mythology and journalism all in one book and then delivers pompous messages about men's individuation from mother and journey into chauvinism. It not only stipulate a latest farsighted of psychology and archetyping, but does so by dissecting the old, cross-culturally familiar "Wild Man."

An Precocious DWJ Title. From the previous review I think this was the book published in the UK as Wilkins Tooth. It's a fun story about two children who run a 'Revenge Service' to make some pocket money. As you would expect in a childrens book the scheme backfires. It reminds me of 'Ogre Downstairs' as it's set in an apparently normal town where extra ordinary events occur. I'm not sure why it's been out of print for so long; many of the issues surrounding some bullies in the story could be helpful to schools today.$LABEL$1,1,0

Something special. I really don't understand all the hype about this movie. I am a personal fan of musicals, so its not the genre that bothered me.

The premise of this book is simply this: love is a exuberant paradise which is at all rotated impeded by such infamous ecumbrances as committment, honesty, integrity and self-sacrifice. This book is the centerpeice of the vile "Oprah Syndrome" booklist. Intellectual depth is now merely a melange of "getting in touch with one's spirit," new-age psycho-babble and dizzy romantic love.

These book's most importantly informations (who pinpoint Hitler's bodies, how Hitler kiiled, where Hitler was buried, something I found of particular interest) should have been summarized in a two-page weekly news magazine article somewhere.

History buffs may want this book for the inserts and for what few pages actually contain fresh, well-presented information, but the curious who just want to know more about Hitler's last days should visit their library or borrow a copy from a friend-- who, I'm sure, won't mind lending it out.$LABEL$0,1,1

Shoulda honorarium more for something else.. I'm abundantly happy with this pressure cooker set. It takes a while to seal, and won't seal if it's not on high heat, so it's hard to make food you can burn, like rice. I think this is because it has safety features not found on old pressure cookers, but perhaps more expensive brands/models don't have this flaw. It's also hard to figure out how to use. The pressure valve label is confusing to some - the correct positioning is 180 opposite from what it appears. Only cooks at 8 psi and 12 psi, not 15 psi (250F), so it requires about 20% more cooking time (at 12 psi) than a 15 psi cooker. Didn't realize this when I bought it. For the $ I paid, it is OK.

The thing is, I'm a little irritated and bored by the story of a 20-something, commitment phobic, seemingly adolescent kind of guy who is such an emotional midget that he can't even say "I love you." The protagonist reminds me of the quintessential young (immature) single guy whose self destructiveness is matched only by his narcissism...the kind of guy women (girls?) really go for until they get a little older and grow a backbone. Harry's a horrible jerk until she draws a line in the sand...then he realizes how much he cares and wants her back...have all of us not lived or heard this scenario in some way a zillion times since we began dating?

Some parts are deed nicely, but this applies mostly to the car parts.The different hikes are not classification by difficulty and also no estimated time is given. However widest is that maps of the hikes are lacked so you lack orientation when you are on your way - I personally would even appreciate topographical maps - but not even knowing which trails I would cross or whether there were any alternative routs was very annoying.

The pre-taped top is actually part of the height, which meant that the bottom came out too short on the first window I did.

Not that Mel Gibson is a bad player, or the govern is wrong, it's just that the message is unreservedly disbelieve.I'm a learners from Britannia, and am uniquely relevant in the British Empire and the colonies in the Americas. But this portrayal of valiant and innocent rebels standing up to evil, Nazi-like redcoats is laughable. British soldiers burning people alive in a church? On what grounds do they base that? The American rebels were early terrorists, not freedom fighters. Half of Americans liked British rule and King George, bless them!See the film if you must, it's quite enjoyable, but dig out your history books later and learn a few home truths about the American revolution.

Lots of fuss over very lesser. I really just don't get the fuss. So far this year this is the most passable manuel I've indignant finishing. And the only reason I finished is because a friend recommended it. I ended up skimming huge chunks just to get through it.The plotting was transparent. With perhaps two exceptions I could pretty much tell what was going to happen. Piercing.The characterization was nonexistent. The heroine had no personality, the hero was perfect and had no personality, the secondary characters were archetypes. Boring.The world building was thrown at you in undigestible chunks at the beginning. A good author weaves the world seamlessly into the plot, IMO.And how hokey - she gets a normal face and doesn't know if she's ugly or pretty <eye roll>. And worst of all, this book ends in the middle of nowhere. It. Just. Ends.

GABO, OF IT PREFERABLY, REJOICING IN MAGIC REALISM. para tropicalized Abelarde-et-Heloise-like story, in which a rabies epidemic is confused with diabolic possession. A beauty of Spanish + African ancestry, already incubating rabies, is pursued by a monk who was in his way to become a saint. Both the young woman and the monk fall for each other with a passion that challenges State and Church, the latter intent in destroying them through its instrument of terror, the Inquisition. They cannot win, of course, but they shake both structures. Her hair does not stop growing even after death. The estate of the decrepit Marquis and his love/hate relationship with his un-titled spouse of mixed origin are only surpassed by GABO himself in his Autumn of the Patriarch.$LABEL$1,1,0

Respect and admiration for a brave bibliophile. Wow...this lady can READ! If she's read half of those she's recommended in two volumes, RE-read many of them, AND found the time to write these books-listing-books atop that, well...I'm truly impressed. That's a life well-lived in the world of reading.It's all a matter of opinion, but a few of her suggestions were outright bombs where I labored to get to page 10 (Amazon probably will strike me down for saying so, but thank God the library's free). Then again, there were a few which more than made up for them-and which I'd never have tried otherwise. I was delighted to find a few of my own favorites among her lists, and some that I'd found to be blatantly missing.The important thing is to keep reading once you find an author or a style you love.

Fine for killing time on a 5-hr flight, but mostly grim.... Grisham's "The Street Lawyer" won't keep you turning the p with excitement like his earlier novels ("The Firm", "The Pelican Brief"). There's not a whole lot of wait, fear, or foreboding in this novel -- the main character has an epiphany that leads him to leave his high-paying, power law firm for a street clinic, helping out the homeless with their legal problems -- not the stuff of a thriller. To be sure, there's some contrived tension arising from some shady characters threatening physical violence and the hope that you're still reading The Firm. But the story mostly just unfolds and then gets resolved. At least the main character doesn't end up living in Aruba at the end of this story :-)For true Grisham fans (and I'm one of them), it's a quick and easy read that you might as well add to your collection, but it won't leave you talking about it the next day like many of his other novels...$LABEL$0,1,1

the secret of her advances. Spud Horne sets down the rules, both spoken and unspoken, that it takes to get ahead and be successful in business. Because they were created by men, following them as a woman presents a different set of challenges.Luckily, Evans lays out these rules in a convenient, sympathetic manner. I guarantee that even if you're already a successful business-woman, you'll find at least a few things here that are helpful and surprising.Sexist-sounding or not, men do see the world differently than women, at least when it comes to business. Women, Evans argues, are socialized differently and because of this need to be aware of how men have set up the game, otherwise they will continue to be overlooked. That's why a book like this is such a help.$LABEL$1,1,0

Surprising disaffected. I gave up on King when he stopped writing horror a few years ago, but had to pick this one up. The Talisman was one of the best King (/Straub) books, so it seems that a sequel would be a sure hit. Unfortunately, this is not really a sequel to the Talisman. Its more of a horror/mystery story with some talisman references tacked on to the end. It was a good story, but the whole time I kept thinking how much better it could have been (Imagine Jack, Henry and Beezer on a journey through the territories).The first 500 pages could have been a lot shorter, leaving more room for what we really want - Jack in the territories again.I think the high point was the tie-in to the gunslinger series though, wonder how he talked Straub into that?$LABEL$0,1,1

Unnerving. Until reading the claims that this book would turn the world on it's ear, I was expecting a whole bunch more. There's been more than 50 years of scientific research into fossil fuels, I find it difficult to believe that all of a unanticipated everything we know about oil is wrong. A few quoted technicians versus 1000's of teams of geologists and research specialists doesn't seem like a fair match.This pounds didn't prove it to me, oil is fairly obviously becoming harder and harder to drill for, and more expensive to bring up. The Canadian Shale takes almost as much energy in natural gas to produce the oil as it's worth, and they can only generate a million barrels a day. Hardly enough to make a difference in a world that uses 89 million barrels of oil per day.For another book in this category I highly recommend Michael Ruppert's "Crossing the Rubicon". THAT book makes sense, and scares me as a see the effects of our diminishing cheap oil supply.$LABEL$0,1,1

Then later on she falls (not sure why, maybe something else hits her) but then the head lady steps on her. Hard. In fact she walks all over her. It's like she did it purposely! Why is being mean to an old lady funny? Is there a back story in which this old lady did something that I am unaware of? I didn't like my son seeing this kind of behavior.

To get the most out of it, your child should have the ability to hold and click a mouse, and should already have basic recognition of capital and lower-case letters. The lowest level is perfect for my child but would have been too problematic at olds 3 - 3 1/2. The software lectured both letter and word recognition as well as phonics.

Makes a good cup of café, BUT.... I was bummed after spending $90.00 for this coffee machine. Minuses: It is cheaply been, no insulation, pretty influential, and no aqueduct filter. Now the thing that makes me most fou is the screw down cap on the carafe, it is extremely hard to open after you brew the coffee because the heat from the coffee distorts the cap,, making it next to impossible to unscrew to get your first glassware of coffee. The cap has a thin edge with small bumps to grip, very bad design. It slowly gets easier as the coffee looses it heat.

For example in it's covering of the <apply> task the use of the <mapper>, <srcfile/> and <targetfile/> tasks within the context of the <apply> task was only 2 sentences. Although the authors had covered <mapper> in a previous chapter they could have discussed them a little bit more in the context of thier use within the <apply> task.

Not only is the music here sappy (and, believe me, I expected that to a degree) but the recording is weak. I have to turn the levels up on my system so high that when I play any other CD the volume scares the hell out of me.

A Rip-off. Either lawsuit how multiple Punisher movies they make or comices they merchandising, two lawsuits making not edit.1. The Punisher maintains to be a clear rip-off/fancy of the Executioner, Mack Bolan, periodicals. Together the trail from the character's originate and motivates to the cohesive and weapons he uses to even a war van which was another Hangman serials initial. Despite the Enforcer is a foreboding of entitlement and wrong, emulates the true vein of justice, yet does it with heart.2. For approximately every 5-30 "bad guys" the Punisher kills, he ends the life of one innocent person.If you believe the end justifies the means and do not mind a few innocent people getting in the way, then you're the type to enjoy this immitation of the largest selling book series in history.$LABEL$0,1,1

Last Junior Year. I read this book for the first stardate when still in homeroom school. I idolized this book because I could relate with the horse aspect that it contains.

Vexing. Because other reviewers have noted, this is a very agonising version of Sudoku. In addition to their complaints, I would state that I get the same board offered multiple times (both Sudoku and Kakuro). I don't know if this is because I haven't met some minimum time? Speed is inhibited by the navigation of the game (at least it does let you wrap around from the top of the screen to the bottom, etc.).One thing I do like about the game is that, being new to Kakuro and not very quick with math, the game tells you when your math does not add up. When I get more proficient with Kakuro, this may become a "leave me alone, darnit" feature, as it is currently on the Sudoku side of the game.Brain Age's version is soooo much better - can't those folks just put out an independent Sudoku?$LABEL$0,1,1

Modest water mark. There weren't many occasions when America's greatest film actor, James Stewart, was flat-out terrible in a movie but this is one of them. For reasons no film historian has been able to explain, Stewart's remarkable skills as an actor deserted him in the early Sixties, and he was never the same. It's an fearsome fulfillment in a Civil War film that is full of them. Only James Best as a Rebel veteran manages to bring some life to the proceedings. The script is sickeningly sanctimonious and made all the worse by the incompetent direction of one of Hollywood's all-time hacks, Andrew V.

A scrap of funding. I bought the WinTV tuner to use essentially as a video capture libretto. Obviously, I believe using a computer as a TV monitor is a waste of a good computer.

The longest capture I have managed so far is 15 minutes, but most range in size from one minute to six minutes. After spending a day splicing together the fragments of a VHS tape I converted with the 350 and which I then burned to DVD, I discovered the quality of the image far below DVD quality.

"Exploitation Rogosh" on video--finally!. The gargantuan "Operation Rogosh" episode of "Mission: Impossible" featured the series' first time-displacement scam, with an environment unconditionally recreated from scratch and a mission that, to be successful, had to be completed within a joyless time-frame. To one extent or another, this first-year installment set the tone for the rest of the series, and after 37 years, "Rogosh" is still mild, and still a model of staging and editing.Director Leonard Horn was a veteran of the sci-fi classic "The Outer Limits" ("The Man Who Was Never Born," etc.), as was writer Jerome Ross ("The Man with the Power"). Other "Limits" tie-ins include directors Lee H. Katzin and Paul Stanley, as well as co-producer Alan Balter.The second episode on the video, "The Train," is more gimmick-reliant but quite entertaining, with one especially nerve-wracking moment.

Find a proper history yet. Perhaps it's a case of, "It's the sort of thing you'll like, if you like that sort of thing", but I can't mention that I favorite this one. The author presents a very-nearly-interesting concept, that Custer survived the Little Bighorn fight, only to be court-martialed for his failures. However, he presents it in third-person, present tense; an unusual choice in modern literature. Also, the narrator offers the inner thoughts of a different character each chapter. The result is a style that I found tedious and forced. As to plot elements outside the realm of what one might read in a history, they appear to have been left out. Although one of the characters refers to the case as "having more intrigues than the Arabian navy", I suspect that I've known houseplants with more interesting lives. Finally, lacking any notes from the author, I'm left not knowing what was fiction and what was not. In the end, I wish that I'd read a proper history of the incident instead.$LABEL$0,1,1

Industrious, poorly organized, etc.. This livres covering excerpts from several of Hubbard's other ledgers, and in a matches litigation from lectures. For a manuel the Church of Scientology pushes heavily, it's pretty fearsome. Toward all the 'sections' are holier, most of the insights are cliché, and there are a few things which are patently offensive. Through example, in one passage, "The Vocabularies of Science", Hubbard calls Japanese a "baby talk language" and proceeds to espouse his almost complete ignorance of the language. I find it difficult to believe the CofS includes that in their translations for prospective Japanese scientologists. On the other hand, if you think Japanese is a baby talk language, and also believe some of the other bizarre assertions in this book, maybe scientology is for you... In sum, I cannot fathom why any thinking person would join the CofS as a result of reading this book. Lousy, preachy, ignorant, and boring. To put it bluntly, a complete waste of money.$LABEL$0,1,1

Don't refuse your treasuries. I pimping one of these to replace my old WearEver Popcorn Pumper (RIP). Boy what I would give to resurrect the old pumper!! The first problem is that this popper is built with the airflow straight up so it blows unpopped kernels out into the bowl. The second problem is that it has such low airflow (necessary due to the arshad) that it doesn't get the popped kernels out into the bowl so they build up and scorch. Add to that the fact that, again due to the airflow direction, it pushes a large number of unpopped kernels out with the popped corn. Then add that the butter melting container is also the corn measuring cup, so you need to stop and wash it between every batch. The butter melting cup is plastic, instead of aluminum like the WearEver, so it doesn't have good heat conduction and won't melt butter that isn't already half melted.Overall, don't waste your money.$LABEL$0,1,1

Assassinated Album Of Blues Covers. Where Me and Mr Johnson focused on acoustic blues ( great job btw ) , this album is quite different . It's plugged - Very plugged . If you want to know why Eric Clapton is held in such high esteem , buy this album .It's an album of covers by blues greats like Eddie Boyd , Lowell Fulson , Freddie King , Albert King and Muddy Waters among others .Clapton's guitar is at the forefront on this album .He does an incredible job with these songs and if you don't agree with people who put Clapton at the top or near the top of the greatest guitar player list ...this album will have you jumping on the bandwagon .If you like blues ..just buy this . you'll love it.$LABEL$1,1,0
Erupted my Eyes to Facebook,and great story and actors ... I went to go see this movie in theatres with avg expectations at best, but let me tell you this movie capitulated and then some. I had no clue the actualy story of how Facebook got started and was unaware that the guy who started Napster was even remotely involved. I am not sure how accurate this movie is to the true story but none the slightest, it was a also draft story, and this movie wss CASTED perfectly having Jesse Eisenberg (who I feel doesnt get the acting credit he deserves, being compared to Michael Cera WAY @ MUCH), and Justin Timberlake did a incredible job portraying the guy who started Napster.I have a Blockbuster online membership,but this is the kind of movie you want to own imo, and they have a great deal for their 2 disc special edition DVD,but since I have a Blu Ray im getting it on Blu Ray which I hope includes the same material.Check out this movie.$LABEL$1,1,0

It would work for a few minutes on full-power and then it was going dead but would run for 20 minutes.

Lea this to be paranoid throughout your pregnancy. Although this libretto is writes from the standpoint of tabled the facto, it does well in a sinuous and paranoid way. The "facts" presented in this book are not the facts but the author's extreme thinks presented from extreme reported occasion that are perfect to exert any mother-to-be paranoia about her pregnancy. This book will make you thinks that having sexuality WILL cause you to have a miscarriage (which is extremely rare!) In addition, the author speculates that having one x-ray at any time in your life will cause all of your future offspring to be deformed... which could not be more FALSE.

It said that it was "Unlocked for use with your existing GSM 850 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, GSM 900 MHz or GSM 1900 MHz service provider" To the untrained purchaser(me) I "assumed" (you know what happens when you assume!) that it was good for ANY service provider. My son tried to use it with his Verizon account and was unable to get it hooked up. At the very least, I think that the seller should have had a link (Like the one he sent me when I tried to return it!) to explain which providers it was good for.

Droll, Fast paced. Dacinda(Daisy) Ann Minor, a character who can only exist in a little southern town, is the archetypal small town spinster librarian. But this particular old fashioned, next thing to a virgin, wants to get married and have babies. On her thirty fourth birthday, she decides to do something about it, and that's where the fun starts. She gets a makeover, moves out of her mother's house, witnesses a murder (unintentionally), buys a puppy, and starts something up with the town's hunky sheriff, who is far from a "good" ole boy. Now the romance in this book is more of the slam-bam-thanks and lets get married-ma'am variety than a Grand Romance, and the action is very secondary. What drives this story forward is Daisy, and then eventually Jack, and how Daisy's evolution changes them both. This is a very fast paced book- everything takes place in less than a month, but it's definitely worth reading if you enjoy a character-driven plot and laughing.$LABEL$1,1,0

Hmmm.... Now THIS is weird. REALLY weird. In fact, I'd go so far and call it the "The Velvet Underground and Nico" of our generation. Okay. Tricky, onetime Massive Attack rapper, teams up with gravelly-voiced singer Martine, and makes one of the sickest albums you'll ever hear. I'm sitting here staring at the keyboard trying to explain what it sounds like and I'm unsuccessful. Some call it "trip-hop" but I say this sounds NOTHING like "Dummy" or "Mezzanine"! Ever heard the song "Downs" from Big Star's "Third Sister Lovers"? That's what a lot of this album sounds like. Unique percussion and static melodies. And lyrics along the lines of "I drink till I'm drunk and I smoke till I'm senseless" and "I f--- you in the a--." with song titles like "Ponderosa" and "Suffocated Love". Pot hallucination experiences put on record, I guess. It's all very VERY surreal.It's also very VERY unlistenable. But hey, so was "The Velvet Underground And Nico"!$LABEL$0,1,1

just my opinion.... At first glance I thought McTeague was going to be a relatively boring read. However, as I progressed through the novel I found myself indulging it and I discarded my initial thoughts about the book.McTeague is actually a glossy, little, fiction story about the innate savagery of mankind. In the novel, McTeague is large, and seemingly harmless, man. McTeague's docile qualities are slowly shed throughout the novel and his underlying, predominant atavistic qualities and behaviors take hold.One of the great things about this fiction novel is that it was derived from a non-fiction event. In the back of the novel there is an in-depth depiction of the events in which the ideas from McTeague were taken from. For those who seek to delve deeper into the novel, there is also a section of criticisms and lots of other useful and interesting discussions in the back of the book.All in all, I enjoyed reading this novel and I would recommend it to anyone.$LABEL$1,1,0

Careful. I couldn't imagines dark craz's findings on track 4, hot bars, and track 9, All I can do. I'm writing this revue simply to conserving S&M, and two of the good (among others) songs on this EP. To say that hot bars doesn't flow it ludicrous at best. Bump this track in the summer time with your windows down and life won't get much better. Both of their corrientes are unparalleled. Granted, there isn't a deep message here; it is such a feel good song though. This track reminds me that everything is all good. Not to mention, when grouch is on the beat, there is rarely--if ever a disappointment. But that is just opinion I suppose. Maybe. Track nine, all I can do, is another S&M classic, with a solid message flowed eloquently over another dope Grouch beat. S&M, especially Murs can flow to fit any mood, they can always make you reflect, and feel good about most any situation. Basically, please be careful when writing CD reviews, there are reputations on the line.$LABEL$1,1,0
Handsome Blender, But..... Purchased this blender since it was sold as a display at 40% off. Knew nothing about it, but did some browse online after purchasing. Seemed to work fine for me at first, but this matin, only it's second use, I understood it was leaked just as many reviewers had complained. Also, the "smoothie" function manufactures more of a "chunky" than a "smoothie" which was rather bummed. Other reviewers have noted that the blade assembly tends to freeze up, and emits dark residue over time, as well as the motor failing after only 1 or 2 years. With only a 1 year warranty I don't feel too confident about this product. If only this $100+ blender worked as nicely as it looks I might keep it, but it's going back ASAP.Update: Finally decided to go for it and ordered a Vitamix 5200. Yes, it's expensive, but so far worth every penny. It outperforms every other blender I've tried.$LABEL$0,1,1

USB 2.0 is assumptions to allows for up to 480 Mbs, while USB 1.1 allows for between 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs. These cables notoriously state on the back of the package that they support 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs max. Thus they don't make as 2.0. What this means is whatever you have hitched through this thing will be slowed down; example, I tried to put my webcamera on it (which does 24 Mbs) and my movements are slowed down noticeably.If you look at the cable connector box, they have stuck on a little sticker that says "USB 2.0" in red. The sticker tries to make it look like that was printed on the connector along with the rest of the labeling. Basically, everything points to this being mislabeled, previous generation product.

I awaiting LEDs are better and the price comes down quickly. GE is fix themselves up for a major backlash if someone can deliver a better product.$LABEL$0,1,1
Don't refuse your money on this battery. Don't lose your money on this battery. The battery that comes with the unit lasts about 30% longer then this one does even though it has a lower MA rating. The battery that comes with the phone is a Lithium Polymer battery. This one is only Lithium Ion which has less capacity for same size.The 1000 MA rating must be incorrect because field use proves otherwise.

Toilet-riffic! (And I mean that in a advisable manner!). My family and I just moved to the states from Japan and we brought some Japanese toilet sets with us.

Blink 182 is the Timberlake Lad of Punk. Note: This is a review of the band as well as the album.That's right. You heard me.

Probably because Blink 182 is a bunch of no-talent prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. I can't begin to comprehend why so many people like them. They're just a bunch of stupid frat-boys who sing about their exes and humping dogs. Even songs that show the slightest bit of potential are ravaged by De Longes grating vocals.

Why not spend a little more time and cook something with some real depth and flavor?This is also a very bad choice for anyone on a budget. 20 minutes comes at a cost: the recipes call for all sorts of pre-made items ("dessert included" often translates into "buy a pre-made cake")Not exactly a celebration of good, fresh food.

Leggy sound, as expectation. The I-Pod looks a lot better when connected to the receiver than my laptop computer did.

Vitally thwart. I'm both a collector and a bibliophile, and this is the first time I've ever thought it essential to this say about any collector's book: In my opinion, this books perfumes. A shame, as it's clear that the author has in-depth knowledge to impart. Unfortunately, it's clouded by the author's apparent dislike of dealers, fellow collectors, and the Homer Laughlin China Company itself.The book designer's collaborative is exuberant and cheerful, much as is Fiestaware; however, the author's text is mean spirited.

So So, not all that startling!. It may am 4,000 fonts but alot of them are basically different versions of the same font.

Said like a psychiatric health textbook. Why is romance and entertainment built on such a sad topic as alcohol? LUCY IS GETTING MARRIED is the kind of textbook that begs for an answer to this quetion.It's no secret that a deep hopelessness and despair is what every alcoholic suffers. The alcoholics state anticipates some degree of relief from the pain of facing reality and other emotional conflicts. It's a kind of sedative. Lucy needs a sedative at length, thus gets drunk herself. Clearly too often. Lucy at age 17 had clinical depression. Is this really the stuff that romantic comedy is made of?This book is interesting to read but not as comedy - it's too sad for that.$LABEL$1,1,0

Not as Shown on the Box. I get this and am precisely not too gratified. Let's contemplate at my list of gripes:1. What you really GET is NOT what is shown in this illustration or even on the box. This means does NICHT come with the pictured tool holder that provides additional stabilised and support. Even though the holder is CLEARLY shown and there is an insert about it in the box, it ain't there.Without the holder, your Dremel is ponly attached to the "table" with a a collar at the top of the tool that is secured with e hex nut. This leaves the body of the tool unsupported and that much linear mass makes for easy deflection when working harder woods.2. Once you have mounted the "table" to a support surface correctly mounting the tool into the holder is a real challenge (I guess I have big fingers)3. The precision of the fence and depth adjustments is really hit or miss as most of the assenbly is plastic.Overall I give it a 2 -- mostly for false inducement.$LABEL$0,1,1

It may be your thing but it definitely isn't mine. I confess I didn't finish the book but the first three stories turned me off completely.

In regards to lacking several words and explanation of others, I also suspect this to be untrue, because the earlier poster would be able to provide specific examples and clearly failed to provide evidence of this.
