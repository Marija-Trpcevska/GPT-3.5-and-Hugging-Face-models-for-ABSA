Arnold in Bestform. I'm a very big fan from Arnold Schwarzenegger and I have most of his films. It's a fantastic career he has made. And Pumping Iron is a fantastic review of his Bodybuilding carrer to see him in his bestform.I can recommend everybody to buy this film who like Arnold Schwarzenegger.Daniel Mrohs$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great Product. I recently purchased this because I upgraded to Windows Vista and there is no driver for my onboard sound as of yet. So I hesitantly purchased this, and am very glad I did. Not only do I actually have sound again but it sounds alot better than my onboard did. Im sure the X-Fi and other high end cards sound better, but for the price, I highly reccomend this.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Entertaining, a wee bit far-fetched. Retired Secret Service Agent Swamp Morgan is sent to handle a potential 'firefly' case involving the murder of several doctors and nurses at a plastic surgery clinic. Apparently the doctors are in the habit of taping their patients while they are recovering from surgery and blackmailing them with the details at a later date. During one of the recovered transcripts a suspicious transcript surfaces about a bomb plot. Could it just be the ramblings of an unconcious man, or something more sinsiter?This story starts off a bit slow with the killer targeting the doctors and nurses. But the character, Swamp is likeable and methodical in his detective work. The middle section involves Connie, a nurse who was off-duty the night of the murder and her struggle with being bait for the killer.I'm giving this 4 stars just because the ending was really goofy. I can't give it away, but... Well... It was a gotcha type ending you are either going to like or loathe.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Box Very Damaged, Didn't Open. The top I received looked as though it had been through a war. They either need to change shippers or package this product so it can be shipped more than a couple of blocks.I had this product shipped twice!! The first was returned, the second I didn't even bother taking it off the truck.When I contacted Grizzly they suggested I buy it from a local source. In other words take your business elsewhere. I find it incredible that a company that ships products all over the world can't seem to package it properly so that it will arrive in reasonable condition. The "Shop Fox" supports I bought with this were in TERRIBLE shape! A local merchant says Shop FOX is owned by Grizzly and they sluff off their damaged or unsaleable products through Grizzly.

Wasted potential. I finished this trilogy and thought to myself what could have been. I think the mythology which this trilogy was based on is fascinating.

Shin Noodles. I had ordered this for my spring break for when my boyfriend came into town, just because I thought it would be a nice little treat for him. Turns out they used to sell Shin everywhere in WA. I had never known because they don't in MI. So when he saw me pull this out of the bag, he started flipping out in excitement. "SHIN!!!!!"I let him cook it the way he likes it, and I must say, this soup is better than Maruchan's. Hands down. I would order this again in the future.

Don't waste your money!. My husband bought me the Magic Bullet for Christmas. He paid $60 for it at a department store. At first I was so impressed by it. We used it almost every day. When we had our first baby I used it to make homemade baby food to save money. I will honestly say that it does work very well....AT FIRST. You'll love it, then be disappointed when it breaks. Before 1 year was up the motor died and it stopped working. This also happened to three of my friends who bought the magic bullet. The customer service stinks and they won't replace it. In my opinion, $60 for 1 year of use is not worth it. You'd be better off spending less on a generic brand blender that does the same thing. I bought a less expensive brand on sale for $15 and so far it works just as well as the Magic Bullet for a fraction of the price!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Short of Learning Latin, Greek, etc.. Dear Potential Reader:I have nothing but praise for Dr. Danner's _Discover It_. He has taken one of the best methods for self-help learning, the graduated inductive method, and combined it with accurate information about the origins of English words. The reader is led, step by step, into developing an ever larger and more enriched English vocabulary. I would say that anyone who works through the entire book will acquire a level of etymological knowledge and a facility with English vocabulary that normally could only be produced by a course in etymology taught at the college level. My own preference would be for students to learn the relevant languages; _semper nobis linguae addiscendae sunt_. But short of learning Latin, Greek, French, and German, you can do nothing better for building your English vocabulary than to buy and use Danner's _Discover It!_. I highly recommend it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Downright horride!. I have no idea what 989 Studios has been doing lately, the last decent Gameday was Gameday '99 for crying out loud. I'm sorry, but this is horrible.

Moderately fun and educational. Scrabble with cards! You have to use all your letter cards to make words, beware if someone else completes this task first, as the cards you can't put into a word are subtracted from your score.

why not set the book in America?. This book should be titled 'Dire' or 'Dreadful'. What is the point of setting a book in London if the dialogue and description are pure American.

Only A Celebrity Could Get This Book Published.

Russert might be a decent guy who appreciates his heritage, but that doesn't automatically result in a compelling story.

Ranch Style trying to pull a fast one. I've been eating Ranch Style Beans all my life and love them. They were made in Fort Worth, Texas for nearly a hundred years. This year, they were bought by ConAgra, the plant was closed and production was moved to Ohio. That's not all that was changed. The cans used to be brimming with beans with just enough sauce. Now fully a third of each can is sauce...they're selling us WATER. They taste the same and for that I'm grateful, but the can says "Beans" and I expect beans...not water. Some slick suit has decided to maximize profit by compromising the brand. Won't work here and I've bought my last can until I can shake the can and it sounds like it has more beans than water. And why would anyone pay almost $50 for a case? I can buy them at Sam's Wholesale Club for $12.00 a case.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Covers important aspects but lacks depth. I teach AI at the graduate level in a major US research University, and I specialize in the area. The book does cover many different areas of Machine Learning. Unfortunately, the treatment is quite superficial.

Roots of Blink 182. Those of you familiar with Cheshire Cat will already know a few tracks on this album, their 1994 effort. Buddha was made during the first year that the band were together, and it shows their tendency toward whimsical, sometimes silly lyrics. It perhaps more accurately portrays their punk roots than the newer albums, where they define a genre of their own. The songs are short, fast and frenetic. The vocals are more shouted than sung.I recommend it, even if your only exposure to Blink is Enema or Mark & Tom Show. It'll take a bit of getting used to, but you'll have a greater appreciation for the band, and you'll enjoy it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

drama in the chillout. Zen...2 has a different vibe from 1. More European more pop. Inverno followed with Sketches of Egypt followed with Deniz is very dramatic.

Great movie, poor DVD. This is one of those classic SciFi movies that scared the 'bgeezus out of every kid who saw it in the 50's/60's. After viewing the spectacular anniversary edition DVD of "The Day the Earth Stood Still," I expected a comparable treatment of "Invaders from Mars" (especially for the price). But no ... the image quality of this Image Entertainment DVD is ....: scratches, blips, and poor color rendition abound. An undergrad film major could have done a better post-production job.

Does not work. Put brand new batteries in it. As a test, I set it to change dishes after six hours (overnight). It did not do it. So I tried another brand new battery and set it for another six-hour interval at 5:11 a.m. this morning. At 12:20 p.m., when I returned home from an errand, it still had not changed dishes. It does not work. I'm willing to give it another trial run this evening but based on what I've seen thus far, I just blew $36 on an item that is worthless. (As an aside, I went to my local Petsmart with the idea of buying either one of two different automated feeders, retailing for $55 and $59.

The only wedding task that really matters - read this book!. I was married recently at age 31 and while I was planning the wedding I was disappointed that so much planning time goes into the dress, and resgistry, and flowers, and, and, and... I enjoyed it but felt something was "missing". Luckily 3 weeks before our big day my girlfriend gave me this wonderful book. It refocused me on what matters. I read it practically cover to cover in one sitting. It describes all the EMOTIONAL adjustments you make -- and aren't really given an outlet for in the frenzy of wedding planning. I feel like I appreciated my wedding day so much more because I read this book.A great engagement (or post-wedding) gift to yourself and your fiance, or to a friend who is getting married.

boring, self absorbed.... She really has a cushy life - how many people could take a year off to 'find themselves', especially in their middle thirties? She eats her way through Italy and gains weight - but hey, she NEEDED to gain as her terrible ex-husband had made a real stink about the property division, and she had lost weight worrying about this. No one else has ever had divorce problems. Well, not like hers as she is so special. She then goes to India to live in an ashram - a Special ashram where only a few people are allowed, by appointment - to 'find God', who is actually revealed to her... (did I mention she is special?) I think she was going on to the gorgeous island of Bali, where she was to find True Love, but I got so bored at this point I took it back to the library.

Disappointed. I was very excited about this litter box based on the glowing reviews. Unfortunately, all the negative comments about this litter box are correct. Even with rolling slowly and tapping the side, all of the clumps would not make it over. There were clumps that got stuck behind and on the sides of the pullout shelf causing bad odors over time. Clean litter also went into the shelf causing a big mess when emptying it. The latches on the litter box are cheap and non sturdy. It defeats the whole purpose if I have to spend 5 minutes banging on the sides or scooping out the extra clumps that did not roll over. After about 3 weeks (I wanted it to work so badly) I gave up, removed the sifter and just use it as a regular litter box. The product was a great idea, just not executed well.$LABEL$0,0,-100
TERRIBLE writing on a fascinating topic. I'm sure Richard Ellis is a fine fellow. But I just can't understand how _anyone_ gave this book a positive review, and I'm 2/3 through it. The redundancies are ridiculous; it's like he never reread or edited. So on page 108 he gives you a long quote from what he tells you is an article from Roper and Boss -- and in _the very next paragraph_ he gives you _the same quote_ again and attributes it! Amazing! And this kind of thing happens continually. How many times does he tell me how big, say, squid axons are versus human axons? I mean, really: this book went totally unedited. Beyond that the comments of other reviewers that he kind of struggles to fill a book about the squid, are true. Of course some of the amazing footage of the past couple years could've been used to pad it out another chapter, but, there's just not enough there there, or at least Ellis isn't able to make it seem so.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Sort of like Toy Story on Qualudes. I can put up with the ages old wisdom of scaring the crap out of kids about the big scary world and the nasty people who live in it, and so what if the falcon is the bad guy and the rodent is the good guy so long as there are no BB guns under the tree, but lets have some fun! This is a kids movie. Stuart is sort of likeable and Snowball the cat has some good lines, but I only watch this sort of thing because I am sure I will feel good at the end and I ended up thinking this movie would make kids not want to go outside. Happy I watched it first.Stuart little is a poor stepchild in a genre filled with excellent heartwarming films.(Aladdin, Lion King, Toy Story, Finding Nemo).$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great Family Movie. While it is based on a true story you can go to the wikipedia page and see that several liberties were taken. But it is what it is and what it is a fun, emotionally moving movie that is funny at times.

Complete waste of money. We bought this product after reading some of the favorable reviews as we wanted to have a seat to take while travelling with our 2 toddler daughters.This potty seat turns out to be a complete waste of money. It is made of very flimsy plastic and the design does not fit ANY toilet seat securely. We tried it backward and forward and each time it does not stay on securely and slips around, rendering it completely useless. Worse yet, my daughters, who each weigh less than 30 lbs seemed to be too heavy as placing them on the seat caused the center to droop.This is one of the worst designed child product I have encountered.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Caution: Migranes Ahead. This is my second Samsung. I bought it based on positive experience with my first 26" Samsung. Anyway, shortly after setup, a high-pitched squeeling noise developed. It wasn't noticable all the time, but it kept returning under various conditions. It seemed to come from the lower left hand side from rear of the unit. Besides squealing, the stand leaned to the left and no adjustments available. Overall, nice picture, beautiful design, easy to use, but the screeching will give you a migrane. Returned it and bought a 32" Sony Bravia XBR (KDL32XBR4) for a few $$ more. Be sure to look for the XBR4 model because it has Motionflow 120Hz speed and 10-bit processing. HD is absolutely amazing on the XBR4. The KDL32XBR4 is by far the best 32" set on the market. Check it out and compare the Sony side-by-side before you purchase this 32" Samsung.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Printer not worth the time or money!. I received this printer as a gift. I thought it was a great idea to be able to take the printer to family functions, take a picture, and give it to the family right away! I only had the printer two years, with little use and many problems. The paper that is supplied with the ink kit began to jam. This became an expensive ordeal, considering I could simply take the digital images to a local store and have them printed for as low as 17 cents a copy. It does take up space in the suitcase, with carrying the printer/powercord/USB cable/ink paper and tray. I used it very little and it recently started to print on only one-half of the photo paper! I contacted Canon, after some basic cleaning and trouble shooting. Canon could not offer any further advice, except that I would need to send it in for repair. Since it was out of warranty, and not worth the time or money, it is now in the trash...$LABEL$0,0,-100

Disappointing production. I'm not a hard core Collective Soul fan, but I admire them enough to own several CDs. I also own the "Music in High Places" dvd, which I was very impressed with. I decided to buy this dvd based on the excellent customer reviews. However, in my opinion, the large concert hall format is distracting from the real talent of the band. The orchestra, instead of adding to the live experience, left me with a feeling of chaos and dilution. Collective Soul is a talented group of men, but their talent is not evident in this production. The "Music in High Places" dvd showcases their excellent musicianship and vocal abilities that this production manages to completely cover up. For a more casual fan, I would not recommend this dvd for an introduction to the band. You just might be fooled into thinking Collective Soul has no talent.$LABEL$0,0,-100

650 Holster. This Holster doesn't seem to fit the Treo 650 phone very well. The bottom corners of the phone are rounded and the bottom corners of the holster are square. The side supports don't fully hug the phone and make me concerned about the phone coming out of the holster too easily. The top support clips the phone right at the slot for the memory card and doesn't seem sturdy enough to keep the phone in the holster. With an expensive phone like a Treo 650, I just don't get a secure feeling from this holster that it will keep my phone safe and on my belt. I refused to take that chance and will not use this holster. In fact, I already purchased the leather TREO holster manufactured by PALM for about $20.00$LABEL$0,0,-100

Good music and features Babatunde Olatunji. This is the same CD as "All The Best From Africa" but at a lower price. Why? Don't know. I would have given it a five star but a lot of the songs fade out long before they are done. It has a good selection of different kinds of music, vocal, percussion, string, etc. The main reason I like it so much is that it features Babatunde Olatunji on tracks 2,3, and 14-20. This is rarely heard Baba music especially to those only familier with his "Drums Of Passion" recordings. Some of the sound quality is not that great but I've heard much worse on other recordings. The CD also has squat for liner notes, but all in all, for the price, it's definately worth it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Este producto debe ser retirado y si acaso, emitir una versión ultra mejorada pero con otro nombre para evitar desacreditar el nombre Lynksys y Cisco.

Brice Taylor Exposes the Mind Control Underworld!. Brice Taylor's brutally honest memoir is fascinating, heartbreaking, and at times humorous. As a former CIA operative, I can verify that she is indeed telling the truth; all of her anecdotes are right on the money!I am familiar with her case and am suprised she has left out Janet Reno and Nancy Regan's involvement because she has irrefutable proof of it. Janet Reno stained a blue dress of hers with her own DNA and Nancy Regan is shown on video directing Brice's gang bang by the members of OPEC in 1980.Even with these glaring omissions, Ms. Taylor has written a compelling book! A must read! Her experiences in Roswell will blow your mind!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Korn before they were Korn. Believe it or not this was the band "KoRn" before KoRn exsisted. It is evident in the powerful riffs played by James "munky" shaffer that he influence a lot in Korn's first and later albums. The high energy almost-disco-like drums brought to all of us by David Silveria (now the drummer to korn) are so much influeced buy grove music you can't help but dance. And of course the low clicky bass sound buy Regginald "fieldy" arvizu just leaves us in awe at the end of every song.

My favorite vegetarian "meat" product. I grew up on this stuff. It's so quick and easy to use. I love that it's never greasy or funky smelling like real ground beef and there's never a danger of e-coli from not cooking it enough. It's also cruelty free. No animals had to die in the process! Yay!I use it for chili, taco filling, and it's easy to make vegeburger patties just by adding bread crumbs, eggs and seasonings. It can even be formed into meatloaf or meatballs. I've made Hamburger Helper with it before which was pretty good. Its uses are endless. I'd love to try this in shepherd's pie. Loma Linda makes the best vegetarian "meat" products.$LABEL$1,0,-100

What a find!!. I watched this movie only because Vincent D'onofrio was in it. And am I glad that I did. I had heard of Robert E. Howard and knew he was a writer, but I didn't know anything else about him. This film shows the depth and loneliness of a man who didn't fit in with the rest of the world; and then he meets a woman who begins to understand and to love him, but ultimately cannot be with him.Vincent D'onofrio gives a wonderful impassioned performance as Howard and Renee Zellweger matches him as Novalyne Price, the woman who befriends him. This film is well worth seeing and I recommend it to everyone. It also contains the most passionate kissing scene I have every seen in a movie. I had to rewind and watch it more than once. (Actually, it was quite a number of times!!).If you're thinking of watching or buying this movie: Go for It!

Not Recommended. While browsing on Amazon for free books, I found this one. I enjoyed it until the ending. THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN! Nor horse lovers that like happy endings. It's a good thing it was free, and also that I can't write a note of disapproval to the author.Soldier Boy is Buffalo Bill's horse, and the book is told partly through his viewpoint, partly in letters from humans and partly with Soldier Boy talking to other animals.An interesting tale of the old west, with a young girl named Cathy who arrives from Spain and bonds with her beloved Soldier Boy.I wonder if Twain planned the ending from the get go, or if he just wanted to finish it quickly...and finish off the main characters, too. I'd love to know why he ended the story in such a gruesome way (a bullfight in Spain).Despite my love of reading about anything equine, I don't recommend this book.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Shuts off when listening to quiets parts in classical music or jazz. This thing is ruined by one seemingly small problem: the transmitter shuts off when it decides the input volume is too low. I guess the designers thought this would be a useful feature. Unfortunately, it makes the thing completely unusable for music that has quiet sections -- especially classical music.

Bad Recording. This CD is a big disappointment. Although the Cleveland Orchestra plays the right notes, the feel of the music is all wrong, especially as far as tempo is concerned. Dohnanyi probably deserves most of the blame here, as he is the one who dictated the crazy tempi and weird phrasing. The second movement is a good example. Dohnanyi seems to be in a race, trying to beat somebody to the finish line. He flies through the thing and slows down just enough every once in a while to make sure the orchestra is still with him. Also, the recording quality itself is pretty clear, but the sound is too bright and thin. Poor.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Amazing camcorder at an affordable price. When its time for me to replace my old Mini-DV camcorder I made an extensive research whether to buy another old technology camcorder (mini-dv or DVD based) or buy a new technology camcorder (HD or hard drive based). I finally compromised on buying this, since this is a compromise between old and new. It uses 3CCD technology which is cool because the same tech. is used in professional cameras.Am I satisfied with my purchase? A big Yes.

Digital Logic. I had to purchase this book for a Digital Logic class i am taking. I am not very happy with the book since it does not cover concepts in detail (with examples in the text) instead it has questions at the end of the chapter but they do not offer the solutions in the book or online so it makes it difficult to know if you are understanding and getting the questions correct. It also jumps around in the chapters, no chapter is stand alone for a specific area.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not user friendly, Adobe won't offer support. We purchased Adobe photoshop elements 6 and premiere elements 4 as a package in late 2007. It was not user friendly software at all, but after much painful reasearch we were able to perform basic tasks. (The main purpose of the software was to create slideshows and burn them to DVDs, and even that wasn't easy to figure out.) Last year it worked well on our old computer, but when we got a new computer with Windows Vista it wouldn't work. I can create slidewhows, but I get an error message every time I hit the button to burn them do a DVD. I called adobe for some help, AND THEY DON'T OFFER SUPPORT FOR PREMIERE ELEMENTS 4.0 ANYMORE. It's only two years old. I guess if you don't fork out the cash to upgrade every year, adobe isn't interested in helping you.Terrible product. Terrible support. It has raised my blood pressure substantially in the past few weeks, and I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY.$LABEL$0,0,-100
um... Mr Bezos?. Okay, I was browsing on Amazon, and I noticed that this book was the first item on Jeff Bezos' "Wish List".Jeff, Forbes magazine estimates your liquid net worth at $3.3 Billion dollars. A book that costs $11.95 is NOT someting that you need to 'Wish' for, particularly since you founded the company that is the primary distribution channel for all print media for the forseeable future. See that button on the website that says: "Add to Cart"? Just click that. No need to add it to your "Wish List". Incidentally, your actual "Wish List" at this point should look something like this:1. Telekinesis2. Governorship of California3. Threesome with the Hilton Sisters4. Mastery of all Time and Space5.

No.. I believe that in this day and age, the term "genius" is being used far too loosely. Since when did this apply to a would-be-McDonalds worker, whose greatest artistic acheivement is breaking the record for the thickest makeup ever worn, and the baggiest clothing? I am appauled. I haven't even touched on the "music" yet.The "music"? Well, if you believe that many painful minutes of jangly acoustic guitars, combined with simple rhyme patterns, combined with bitter lyrics about how "I've been mistreated by boys" is genius, well than maybe YOU need to take a look in the mirror, and ask yourself...WHY?

Horrible!. I had this vacuum for exactly two days when I asked for a refund. It did not pick up anything!

Average. Bombay is my hometown and it is also one of the world's great cities inspiring writers from Salman Rushdie to Vikram Chandra and Suketu Mehta. Maximum City is an average work that deserves some attention but not much - it covers the usual suspects - gangsters, movies and the night life - but it doesn't touch on countless other subjects - which is understandable, Bombay has tens of millions of people and each of them has their own unique story.

Immature protagonist. Mother always did like you better; for that matter, so did Dad. This is the theme upon which Harris's new novel is based. The critics are saying it's about returning but it's really about self-pity as well as self-aggrandizement. Every time a problem arises, Mado races to the rescue (probably in an effort to prove to Dad that he should have loved her best)And if that's the point, then Harris failed to show me that the issue was with Mado and not with Harris herself. This felt like a first book. You know the ones--thinly veiled autobiography where the author airs a tired old grievance. And because of her past success, her editor and the critics let her get away with it. She also got away with my money and now I have a grievance to air.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Total Nonsense.. Don't read this garbage. Robert Prechter has done a great deal of disservice to America, by spreading nonsense material which has no real foundation on modern economic and financial theory. People will get hurt by following this nonsense. It is sad that in this enlightened new millenium, some people will still listen to people like him. Everyone lost money in the stock moarket in the last two years, including myself, but in retrospect the public was blind not to see the coming tech wreck in 1999. But the equity market will recover sooner or later. Prechter is overdoing now, with no theoretical foundation. He will hurt a lot of unsophisticated readers, and undermine our society.$LABEL$0,0,-100
It sucked. first of all-When I walked into the theater there was NO ONE only me, my mom, and my sister so that gave me second thoughts on how good the movie was.

Great Read, Great Sense of Place. In a former life (as an architectural historian, of all things), I spent a lot of time on the same mean streets of Southern New England as Joe Gunther (albeit with a clipboard and a camera instead of a badge and a gun). Mayor's books are really notable for their sense of place -- I can call up clear pictures of his over-grown millyards and sagging tenements every time I read one of his books.Mayor gets the people right too. Even though his is a cop's-eye view, the villians are not simply generic "bad guys." They are individuals, with individual strengths, weakenesses and even talents.Mayor's books are procedurals with lots of procedure (he's a real-life Vermont constable) and now and then I lose track of a pawn or two in the bureaucratic chess game just because there are so many of them. But overall, an incredibly solid and admirable series.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not as good as it sounds. Instead of buying this book, I went to the library to check it out and after reading the other reviews, I was very disappointed. This book has little to do with "sanity saving" it's mostly just letters of unique situations written to the author of this book. He replies with common sense advice and even sometimes advice that "beats around the bush" (indirect advice). For the average healthy bride I recommend reading the book by the Knot (don't remember what it is called but it has "The Knot" in the title). I also got that at the library and it has absolutely everything! No need to get another book. It offers real "sanity saving" advice and some real life stories for all situations. But if I have to say something positive about the other book, it does have a cute cover... but thats about it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Revealing what?. The concept of the book is to reveal the errors of Islam, and the author manages to this to a certain degree. Unfortunately he also reveals his own flat-tyre Protestant theology! Comparing words in the two religion's main Scriptures is indeed important and interesting, but the author falls into the "Bible-bashing-mode" so typical of many protestants. He does not know and does not quote any of the Church Fathers' interpretation of crucial passages, and therefore he fails to make his case agains Islam and its literal understanding of spiritual life. It is a pity, because the author is well-intentioned and enthusiastic. But he talks too much about himself and his friends being "spirit-filled", and he never manages to get beneath the surface of the Christian Theological arguments against Islam. 2 stars for trying to do it anyway. Read instead St. John of Damascus' "Writings" in the CUA series.$LABEL$0,0,-100

While the main body of the creel seems durable enough, the straps that are attached are not, also the way that the lid of the creel is attached to the main basket is to flimsy.

The only essential study tool for the GRE. After purchasing both the Barron's and Princeton Review GRE books, I found that this book is the only one that is essential for studying for the GRE. While other books contain some useful tips (particularly vocab lists) this official book from the GRE is necessary because it contains real past GRE exams. Other books write model exams similar to the GRE, but because the questions have not been thoroughly tested, the questions on these model exams are oftentimes confusing and sometimes just flat out wrong. My scores on the exams in the Barron's and Princeton Review books were not indicative of the score I actually received on the GRE, only "Practicing to take the GRE General Test" gave me a good idea of where I stood in my preparation for the test.$LABEL$1,0,-100
One of the best. When I first heard of this movie during the Academy Awards, I was skeptical of the plot because well, how could a person shield such horror from one's child, especially at a time such as the Holocaust? Yet, somehow, this man did. And the reason I feel that it was like that is because it was a relatively short stay. I don't think he could have pulled it off if it were longer. What I love about this movie is that I was touched by it. And each time I see it, I am more touched, and I fall in love with a certain aspect of the film. Despite the fact that I am African American, I can identify with this film, and I give it two thumbs way up!! (Personally, it needs more than five, more like ten)$LABEL$1,0,-100

Being Part of the Mayhem. I had read all about the earthquake, seen all the photos, gone to exhibits. Still, nothing took me inside the mayhem the dual forces of nature and politics caused as the earth shook like reading 1906. 1906 gave me a great mental picture of the times, and although ficticious, skillfully allowed me to suffer the effects of the earthquake along with the characters.

A Boost for the Praying Woman. The Yada Yada Prayer Group series has been a tremendous boost for my own prayer life. To those of us who sometimes feel our prayers are same old, same old, reading about this group of women who actively participate in a fervent, Spirit led prayer life has changed mine. In Book 3, The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Real, these women have grown closer to each other, and the true-to-life situations, though sometimes seeming to be hopeless, get prayed over bigtime, and with the thanksgivings typical of the group. The women don't forget the practical gifts of love either, such as spending time with Adele's mother who is suffering from dementia.God's answers to their prayers are delivered in His perfect time and way, often bringing surprises as He does for us all.The books are great, and improve with re-reads.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Informative, beware binding. I bought this book to use for a horse class at a local college. My first warning is the binding! It doesn't take long, or too many times of opening the book before the glue comes undone and sections of the book fall out. I tried my best to be delicate to avoid this from happening but, it still came apart.Some of the information is written in a confusing manner and some things are not entirely up to date. The non-updated information is not abundant and one can still learn plenty of information by reading this book.The book does cover everything from the possible cost to the mechanics of a horse, and many other things. It is a good book to have if you're new to horses. But, I would only buy it if you can find a cheap price on it. Simply because of the binding falling apart.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Poor quality, breaks easily. I got these as a wedding gift in July 2010, via Bed Bath and Beyond. These just sit on my counter and don't get moved or pushed around much, so they are under minimal use. In Febrary 2011 (7 months later), the largest jar got a huge crack in it, which has continued to grow and has now rendered the canister unusable.The plastic threads on the second to largest size became unglued from the stainless steel lid. Upon examination, I discovered that they had only glued it in two places, with only a small amount of glue.Also something to take note of is that the openings aren't wide; they are about 3.75 inch diameter from inside rim to inside rim. The advertised 4.25 inch diameter mush be from outside rim to outside rim. My 1 cup measuring cup will not fit in the canisters, which is extremely inconvenient.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Billions are dead and the Klingons are in the unconventional roll of acting as transport ships of the injured and refugees left in the wake of a massive evacuation that has decimated much of the alpha quadrant.Makes a nice tie-in to the Star Trek S.C.E. series.$LABEL$1,0,-100

not a well-made set. I bought this for my son who likes to create art. I figured the handy case would be easier for travel as it would contain everything he needed. Well, it stinks. The inside liner of the case falls out, the paint rounds dont stay in their plastic container at all. So you have to constantly put them back in everytime you open or close the case. This case is not worth it! My son just took all the stuff out and put it in other containers because he was tired of dealing with it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Amazing Classroom Tool. I am an instructional asst. in a Special Ed. class for emotionally disturbed kids aged 8-11. Most of our kids are on meds for their severe behavior problems. I listened to SOOTHING MOMENTS and loved it so I decided to try it out in my classroom. I was amazed and grateful when I turned on the CD and the entire class calmed down.

Come on, what a disappointment. Why do the authors in the fantasy have this new 'cool trend' of writing huge 'epic' series filled basically with subplots and only a nebulous main theme?All the so-called 'fantasy kings'- Jordan, Terry Goodkind and now GRR Martin have disappointed me greatly. The 'epic' style is very unsatisfactory, more like a soap opera than an epic. Tolkien wrote epic and grand stories, but were they neverending, rambling creations? I had more hopes for this particular series but the author appears to be squandering it away with another Jordan-like fiasco. If you want tightly woven, well-written fantasy, don't expect to be satisfied here. Look at Pullman's provocative and beautiful His Dark Materials, or Ursula K Leguin's thoughtful trilogy. Or go back to the major figure in the genre, Tolkien, and see why these authors are worth reading. These books are more like Swords-and-sorcery Grisham then fantasy. The genre really is going downhill.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Excellent field guide great pictures & information!. This field guide on snakes is excellent. The pictures of each snake are clear and you can identify them easily when you see them in the wild (or in you're house). The organization of this book splits up into two sections venomous and nonvenomous which allows a very quick way to tell if you should be anywhere near the snake. The infromation on each type is plentiful and everything you need to know is included. There are maps of where to find each type and whether they are endangered or protected in the state of Texas. A system is given in the beginning of the book for how to easily determine a snake and also what to do if you happen to be bit by a venomous type. The only thing I would like to see in the next revision is the striking distance of each snake which isn't given in this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The theory sounds good but it's too hard to follow. This diet sounds good. The theory seems sound. The idea is simple. But putting the theory into practice was just too hard for me. I'm a mom and wife, and trying to get my family to adjust to something this extreme was simply not reasonable. As it was, I found it almost impossible to get through the day without some form of carbos, and I'm not talking needing big dishes of ice cream, even a simple bowl of rice would have been welcome! As well, I found the lack of fiber in this diet to be a real drawback, and the suggestion to use things like Metamucil and take large quantities of vitamins to be unrealistic. The key to real weight loss seems simple, eat less, exercise more. This diet just didn't cut it for me.$LABEL$0,0,-100
DO NOT TOUCH!!!!. I happen to be a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies, but you must fight all urges to buy this one, folks. First of all, the picture quality wasn't that great. I've seen worse, but it is poor quality and very grainy (which suprises me given the good quality of other Retro Media titles). Next, the acting is atrocious. I can usually deal with bad actors and actresses (as I said earlier, I'm a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies) if the plot is decent enough or if the story is at least entertaining enough. But this is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! There are no, I repeat, no redeeming qualities in this movie. So, why did I give it two stars you ask? The extra materials, that's why. There are some pretty neat things on the rest of the DVD (such as Nite Owl Theater bloopers, outtakes of the movie, and, of course, a new episode of Nite Owl Theater). But believe me, it is not worth the price of the DVD. STAY AWAY!!!!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Compares to P.G. Wodehouse. The highest compliment I can pay this book is that it is the only American work that truly bears comparison to the great P.G. Wodehouse. Dobie, though far from a confirmed bachelor, captures some of the inspired daftness of Bertie Wooster's narration of his own impossible adventures.I loved this book when I was a teenager forty years ago, and loved it just as much when I reread it last year.

Woolley gives J.C.B. his due at last. Robert Woolley presents a fine rendition of these Op. 17 sonatas on a fortepiano built at around the time of J.C. Bach's death. He endows them with feeling and humanity without a lot of overindulgence in rubatos or other mannerisms. The "prestissimo" movements of sonatas 2 and 6 are especially good, played with breathtaking virtuosity. And as Woolley demonstrates, there is an excellent case to be made for J.C. Bach as a worthy composer in his own right, and not just "another son of J.S. Bach" or "a precursor of Mozart." Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Two hours!. It took two hours for Ralph Fiennes whose blindness isn't even noticeable to ask Natasha Richardson who is nothing like a Russian to "date" him. OMG. This movie is ridiculous. I can't believe this was a Merchant and Ivory movie because the cinematography was so clumsy. Most of the shots were small screen quality but less interesting and creative than Jerry Bruckheimer produced small screen fare. I'm sure people who are interested in wartime era Shanghai/expat culture will give this movie a scan but for the rest of us, OMG. Ralph Fiennes rarely has chemistry with anyone. I have no idea why he found Natasha Richardson compelling. The costumes were not flattering. This movie was more boring than the not that interesting Naomi Watts in wartime Shanghai movie, The Painted Veil. OMG.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A real disappointment. I like Linda Howard and have read all her books but Open Season is bad. The book cover reads `Seamlessly blending heart-pounding romance and breathless intrigue'. Seamlessly blending it was not. It took Ms. Howard twelve chapters to remember there was suppose to be some intrigue in this book. And calling it intrigue is really stretching it.

Classic Television Drama @ its finest!!!!!. I used to enjoy this show. Ienjoyed the actors as well they did a good job. I definitely liked the drama and the suspense it was done very well. Dallas was a popular Television show and a lot of people watched it. The show had great production and actors. I liked Victoria Principal (Pam Ewing) who was married to Bobby Ewing and had a son named Christopher. But the most infamous one of the main characters J.R. Ewing (Larry Hgaman) the son of Mary Martin (Peter Pan). J.R. kept the drama going he and Sue Ellen duked it out so much .

I wish I could put a regular wheel in here, but can't because of the pyramid shape of the cage. All of the accessory pieces you can buy for this are total junk too.

Misery Bay and Other Stories from Michigan's Upper Peninsula. "Lauri Anderson's latest collection of poignant stories is a wonderfully rewarding read. These stories are not only dedicated to the Copper Country, but truly celebrate the Finnish character that has played such an important part in creating a Copper Country heritage. Here are our heroes, survivors against all the odds, in this remote land, true to themselves acting with an unconscious humility. These often bittersweet stories are set in historic contexts that make them utterly convincing. There are many literary allusions, and even characters such as Vainamoinen and Hemingway play a part. The clean rhythm of the language mimics the Finnish language and underlines the basic humanity and individuality of these Copper Country Finns."$LABEL$1,0,-100

Meerkat Manor Season 1. Being a South African I have a huge interest in the Meerkat as they are my favourite animal. Some of the farming community come across little one's in the veld left behind on their own and the farmers raise them by hand and keep them as pets. They are not kept in cages and they are loved and taken care of very well. We suspect the Meerkat are left behind homeless possibly due to their parents being killed by other animals or what we experience mostly is road kill. However, I found the DVD's extremely interesting. Wonderful footage and beautiful photography. It's almost like watching a "soapie"!

This is an ordinary card, nothing special. The VIA chipset is strictly for low level work = 2 video streams max throughput. Better to find a card with the Agere' or Lucient chipset which can pass as many as 8 video streams at once. The price is OK, but you can do better for the same elsewhere. Easy install? All modern FireWire 1394a and 1394b cards are plug and play = no driver required, so this is no advantage here. Reliability? you would be better off finding a card with internal power connector as the FireWire 1394 power drain can be quite a strain on cheap PC motherboards, especially with external drivers and burners.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Poor Quality. This is the second HeartRate monitor I've owned. My first was a Polar model, which I unfortunately lost during a move.I bought this Omron HR-100C model primarily due to its price, and also seeing that it was a best-seller on Amazon. Unfortunately I've found the quality lacking. Particularly when trying to switch between HeartRate and other modes, the watch will beep when the button is pressed, but won't always change modes. (It takes repeated presses of the button to change.) This is especially frustrating when you're riding and trying to fiddle with the fool thing.If all you need is a basic HR monitor, this will work.

It takes you in a markeitng journey to explain how to make your church grow.It is good teory, there are great advices and will help to stablish a "good" marketing culture in your church. A must have for those with poor markeitng knowledge.As a portuguese speaking country, I am using it to teach those concepts to our church council, because not everybody will be able to read it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The BEST Album By Madonna. Erotica has got to be Madonna's best album!! This album explores every aspect of sex while giving you great rhythm and awesome dance songs... Deeper and Deeper is a reflection of the club scene in the 70's with a twist of the 90's and a great beat... Madonna is one of the most influential artists and this is one of her most influential albums because it showed that women can be sexually provocative...$LABEL$1,0,-100
Worthless Drivel. Despite the endless high brow rhetoric and circular reasoning of Darwinists, the simple fact is Dawkins and his diciples of the church of naturalism can't explain the absolute origin of anything, even a hydrogen atom, let alone the universe. True, empircal evolution (i.e. adaptation, speciation, selection, and genetic drift) is all well and good - and irrefutable - but it has zip to do with origins, and will remain a delusional fantasy for those who reject the Biblical record of sudden creation and the subsequent global water catastrophe. Life is short, truth will be revealed to all - some only get it after death.$LABEL$0,0,-100
New Found Stardom. This has to be one of my favorite albums of all time. Basically, it's five Florida natives taking half an hour to share their interpretation of punk music at its best...and they succeed. You've got Jordan belting out lovesick anthems like "Eyesore" and "All About Her", then switching to funnier moments with "Boy Crazy" and "Sucker for a Kiss". "Ballad for the Lost Romantics" pretty much ends a great album. If I sat here any longer, I'd name all the tracks and give you reasons why they rock, so buy the CD and wear it out. I guarantee that if they don't become one of your favorite bands, they'll give you thirty minutes of damn good fun.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Planet Bike Protege 9.0. So far I love the Planet Bike Protege 9.0. When I installed it and tried to take it off (very hard to get off), I thought I broke it ,I didn't. The other night I got my bike ready to take with me to work the next day so I could ride it at the park and completely forgot to protect it from the dew. When I got off of work, I checked it and was working great! I had bike tire issues (note to self, don't air up the tires to the maximum p.s.i that is on the tire) so I haven't really gotten to test it out much. One tip is you push it from the bottom to the top to reset it. I was trying to push down and then up at first and couldn't figure out why it wasn't changing. To reset it, just keep pushing until completely 0's out. I don't think it was very hard to install on my mountain bike. It took me about 20 minutes to install and adjust it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
unspectacular. I'd written a review for this game when I was in the middle of playing it. When I finished, I wished I hadn't spent the time. Here's the deal... I hated almost every character in the game. They were annoying! How are you really expected to enjoy a gaming experience when you hate all the characters you play as?What I liked in the game was the deep story, and I loved the combat system. Combat was actually a lot of fun. The graphics were nice too.What I hated involved all the characters and the way they reacted to things. In fairness, there were a couple of characters I liked, like Bebedora (sp?). It may be an unfair comparison, but in games like Final Fantasy, you can go back to various areas, and there's all sorts of side quests and weapons you can get. It gave the Final Fantasy series a lot more depth.Ultimately, this could have been worse, but if they'd just made the characters interesting, it would have been a lot better.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Good keyboard but over time letters wear off. My husband is a "hunt and peck" typer. One of our computer desks is in our bedroom. My husband always had to have a light on when I was trying to sleep when he was on the computer working, so he could see what he was typing. I bought him this Saitek keyboard for Christmas last year (2007). Our entire family, including children love this keyboard and it is used several hours a day. The only issue I have is, after ten months the paint is wearing off of the frequently used keys. It's not a problem for me, but the "hunt and peck" typers I live with will eventually have a problem. It's still a good keyboard and I may try to put permanent marker letters on the keys eventually and see how that works. Overall a good product. Even if I have to purchase another one eventually, the light is off when my hubby is typing. I'm happy!$LABEL$1,0,-100
As in all of Crichton's books, you learn something while being entertained.. Michael Crichton excells at teaching you while you are reading (or in my case, listening - I heard it as an audiobook read by Blair Brown).In this case, Crichton tells us about the world of airplane design and construction. However, the more compelling story is that of the news media getting the story wrong due to lazy work - the same theme as is developed in "The State of Fear." Seeing stories that are produced on the local level in my city about items that I have personal knowledge of, I cannot say that I disagree.Entertaining, informative read.Final grade: B+$LABEL$1,0,-100

Just Another Musical. I found this film to be average. I find most musicals (especially MGM productions) to be tedious, so that probably contributes to my lack of enthusiasm for it. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is Gershwin's great music. For fun with friends, or by yourself, wait for the "An American in Paris" ballet at the end of the film.

No good product. Used to be a loyal sony customer as all me previous products were close to invincible. So I went out of my way to purchase a sony for my first camcorder. Took it home and turned it on... then it died on me. Yep right there and then, no abuse nothing, just died on me. The customer service apologized but didn't do much. To me I cannot fathom how sony is staying in business (i wish I read these reviews here first before I made my decision, as obviously they are going on a downhill trend as far as quality is concerned) with kind of quality. I will never buy another sony product again and will make sure no friends of mine make that mistake.DON'T BUY!!$LABEL$0,0,-100

An unessential release. With every release, these kings of emo get more mundane and self absorbed. Typical fugazi songs that go nowhere new, which isn't necessarily a bad thing except that all their sheep-like fans always claim that fugazi is so cutting edge.

Yes, and you can too!. Jez Alborough is among my favorite authors of children's books. In this book he has imagined a tale so eloquent and so memorable that it will quickly become a family favorite. The illustrations are beautifully painted, made especially vibrant because of Alborough's heavy use of greens and blues. The author has perfectly imagined the characters expressions, from curious glances and despondent faces to joyous looks of wonder and satisfaction. This book has to be read aloud! Having presented this title dozens of times to numerous audiences, I can tell you that this is among the best books I have read to children and their parents. My audiences always applaud my telling of this book, largely I think, because of the passion I put into reading it, which is made easy by the rhythmic text and the dialogue that begs to be voiced. The surprise ending is always a hit with my listeners and brings relevance to the title. This is a must-have title for your child's library!$LABEL$1,0,-100

McCulloch Steam Cleaner - product defective. McCulloch MC1275 Steam Cleaner. I received this product almost immediately - shipping was very fast. The product was packed very well - every part was individually wrapped and secured within the box. Unfortunately I never got a chance to use it. You have to assemble the handle on top - which holds the hand piece and is the only means for lifting the cleaner to move it around. However, the handle could not be affixed according to the instructions.

Same old, same old. Yet another "authoritative" tome on behavior modification. The title of the book made it sound interesting, but upon closer scrutiny its tired, teacher-in-control theme reared its ugly head. It's amazing that years after more effective models of classroom management have been devised, implemented, tested and their effectiveness confirmed (both by teacher/administrator evaluations...AND independent research studies), the Skinnerian behavior modification model still reigns supreme. If you must buy this book, do yourself a favor and also check out Beyond Discipline by Alfie Kohn and/or Teacher Effectiveness Training by Dr. Thomas Gordon -- then make up your own mind.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Don't be fooled.. While it may be new, the device is junk. The frequency, amplitude and phase adjustments are not in "real time", that is, when you turn the knob, the digits do NOT follow you as you turn it. There is a significant time lag which makes it particularly difficult to zero in on a particular value. More over, the device is very light and cheaply made. I don't think that you could give it away to others once they see how it functions. That said, if you don't care about what value of frequency, amplitude or phase, or are only interested in very ball park values, this may work for you. The output signal does not seem to be bad as measured on an oscilloscope. It's the usability that is of concern.$LABEL$0,0,-100
This Game REEKS. I borrowed this game to try it out. I had never played a Zelda game before and had heard that they were really good. But after I played it awhile, I found myself incredibly bored. I got extremely tired of sitting there waiting for the characters to stop talking already! And although Link (the main character) has a sword, he rarely uses it. Then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again. Talk about barely any action. After that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that, apparently, lets him controll the wind. What's with that? I don't call this a "puzzle" game. I call it a BORING game. I suggest you buy a Mario game, which cleverly combines puzzle with action.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great machine for the price!!!. I am a General Contractor and we do our own insulating, drywall and trim. I purchased the 50-760 more as a combination air cleaner(1micron bag)and dust colector that we could run continuously while we are working around it. It is a reletively quiet machine, dead silent compared to our large shopvac. It has plenty of power and with the castors it is a dream to move around the houses we work on. I purchased the 50 hose as well so that we could clean the air in smaller rooms without working around the machine and having to keep moving it. It has great suction and the two nozzles move a great deal of air. The only downside is the plastic collection bags are a little difficult to install the first time but it is very nice knowing how much is in them.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good TV....if it doesn't break.. I purchased this television in May, 2006, and it's performance was great while it lasted. After about 3 monhts, the tv began to malfunction. The colors would fade in and out, and then the picture would be rendered in about 4 colors, making everything on the screen a psychedelic blur. Eventually the screen would go out altogether, leaving me with a wonderful 32 inch flat-screen "radio". Westinghouse says they will take it back in for servicing, but it will cost me a fortune to ship it to them since I'm at an overseas military base. The bottom line is that this is a good tv, but it should have had a life span greater than three months.$LABEL$0,0,-100
If only I were Spider-Man.... Wow! This movie is amazing! The special effects will blow your mind! Spider-Man blends utterly thrilling action with some light comedy, drama, and even a bit of romance! It's the ultimate movie-lover's movie. I really enjoyed it a lot, and what made it even more amazing was having Kirsten Dunst play the role of Mary-Jane, the object of Peter Parker's affection. A beautiful face, and excellent talent. Tobey Maguire is also a great young actor, full of spunk and after this movie, I'm sure he's going to be a "breakthrough" actor, totally mainstream.

Junk. Purchased, received, unpacked, turned on. That's where things started to go downhill. I slid the little light changing tab across and it snapped off, flew out of my hand and onto the floor where one of my cats thought it was the best little toy I had ever bought her. After wrestling the small piece of plastic away from the cat, I reattached it to the little metal piece that "held it" (obviously, I use that term loosely).

Excellent A Cappella Singing for the Holidays. Primarily A Cappella is a label devoted - no surprise - to a cappella choral singing: vocal jazz, barbershop, national contest winners and local quartets alike. This CD is the label's first sampler designed to display the range of their offerings in holiday arrangements (their second, "A Voices Only Christmas," is very nearly as good as this one). The result is an eclectic, energetic, entertaining collection. There are excellent tracks from such vocal jazz dependables as the Swingle Singers, the Blenders (a smoooooth "First Noel), the Real Group, the Persuasions, the Nylons, and Rockapella (the bittersweet "Hold Out for Christmas"). Other standouts include the Haven Quartet's syncopated, ecstatic "Joy to the World," La Bande Magnetik's hilarious "Casse Noissettes," and especially the House Jack's thrilling "Saturnalia Smile," but the whole CD is a delight.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Why do supervisors ecommend this book. I have heard Guyton described as a "fine work of English prose". I must say I disagree. I have found that it is difficult to use, that it fails to go into enough depth as a reference yet goes into too much depth as a revision work. The diagrams are poor, the pages flimsy (and in my edition in the wrong order!), and it is just far too heavy to carry around. The physiology focuses more on obscure subjects and hardly at all on the essentials. I have hardly used this in my first year as a medical student and am unlikely to start soon.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Cynical, sly and revisionist. This guy is really "stuck in the '60's", or rather what he thought the sixties were like when he was a naive youth. Many people tend to idealize their younger days, but to pass their fantasies off as history is a disgraceful act. It is also blatantly false and misleading.

I give this game a 4.5, nothing is ever perfect. But the developers did a good job of taking a legendary series & creating something everyone can enjoy as oppose to Spyro & Crash who unfortunately did nothing but failed since their oweners left.

Great Collection. Great collection spawning from Springsteen's early rock (Born to Run, Thunder Road, Badlands) to his cheesy pop hits (Dancing in the Dark, Hungry Heart), his story ballads (The River, Atlantic City), rock anthems (Born in the U.S.A., Glory Days), and his newer rock hits (Human Touch, Better Days). At the end he throws in soundtrack hit "Streets of Philadephia" and some new tracks.Overall the collection is excellent; it shines from the "Born to Run" album through "Born in the U.S.A" album and then the song quality drops a little for the rest of the album. But every songwriter has a "golden period" and sooner or later will decline. Still, even on later tracks such as "Murder Incorporated" and "This Hard Land," his ferocious singing and deep lyrics are impressive. My one qualm is not including the haunting ballad "I'm on Fire."$LABEL$1,0,-100
Stop trying to impress with your mystery knowledge. If the author would stick to writing mysteries, her books could be among the best in the genre. However she spends way too much time describing people's actions and motives by comparing them to another author's characters. Noone thinks or does anything on Broward's Rock without Annie commenting to herself that the thought or action was just like this or that fictional mystery character. While I enjoy the bit with the contest that has the characters guessing their fictional origin, this constant "showing off" of the author's mystery fiction knowledge detracts from the story. Any true mystery buff probably knows as much but hopefully doesn't spend their time sizing up their friends and family by this criteria.Stick to the mystery writing and leave the mystery trivia to game players.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Worth the money. I bought the Williams Sonoma brand with the aluminum insert as a Christmas present for myself. I already own 3 slow cookers, one 4qt, one 5qt, and one 6qt, all of them different brands. I never noticed that all 3 of them on low setting is not a true low setting until I used my new All Clad. I now know what everyone else was talking about. I made lentil soup and turkey stock both on low setting for 6-8 hours and my turkey stock came out clearer because it was on a true low setting. And my lentils were not mush, they held their shape. I prefer the 7qt size because I can freeze half of what is made. Even after we eat the other half, there is still enough for lunch the next day. I will be making my meat sauce for pasta tomorrow and knowing the low setting works correctly, I am sure it will turn out delicious. I also like that the lid is stainless steel, because if I drop it, it will not break. Also, I can put the lid and insert in the dishwasher and it comes out beautiful.$LABEL$1,0,-100

An excellent paperweight. I am a graduate student in mathematics so I've been through my share of textbooks. To this day, I have not found one quite as inconsistent as this one. Some sections are flawless; the author is elegant in his explanation, the examples are clear and relevant, and the problems serve their purpose. However, the poorly written sections (and trust me, there are plenty of them) far outweigh what little beauty lies in this textbook. Anyone who wishes to meticulously plow through this book will know what I'm talking about. The most depressing thing about it all is that I can't seem to find a book (on DE's) that's any better!

Better Than Tap Water. We had quite a "fancy" water purifier for many years and since we couldn't decide what to purchase to replace it, we ordered a Brita for the transition.

Super easy to assemble. I bought this cabinet to use as food storage because I live in an efficiency apt with no cabinets in the kitchenette. Although it was a little heavy to move upstairs to my apartment on my own, I was able to do it by tilting it on its side and sliding it up the stairs by pushing it from behind, so it can be done without help if necessary. And, as the other reviews stated it is very easy to assemble; The directions are simple, I had no problems doing it alone, and it took no time at all (less than an hour(?) - could easily be done in 30 minutes the next time, I think, especially with help). It really does fit together just like giant legos - no tools required!

Feels like thin felt, soft but thin enough to see thru. I ordered these sheets for our guest room, having family over for Christmas and it's cold outside. I was expecting "Fleece" which is the exact word used to describe these sheets in the seller's description - however, these sheets are more like thin, see thru felt used for art projects. The back side of the top sheet has a nylon back, so it's not even the same material on both sides the top is a felt like material and the back side is stretchy nylon material. Hopefully they will be okay for the 5 days we have guests, but definitely NOT for long time wear.$LABEL$0,0,-100
fact of fiction?. I realize Mr. Marion says this book is a mixture of fact and fiction, but the amalgamation of both coupled with this writing style, essentially render the whole effort fiction and comic-book fantasy reading. As such, if you read it for entertainment purposes only, it has engaging sections. Yet many sections completely bore you or make you feel Mr. Marin is simply boasting about his supposed prowess and intellectual escapades (not to mention his sexual escapades). In short, after the roller-coaster ride through Tokyo's Chuo-Ku, it leaves you somewhat cheapened, like a one night stand by the author and Wall-Street's biggest. I suppose that was the intent based on the title, but you never realize how bad that can be till the "morning after."$LABEL$0,0,-100
Miles Davis quietly guides listeners through "Forrester". Gus Van Sant, the filmmaker responsible for "Finding Forrester," chose Jazz pioneer Miles Davis to guide us through this complex drama. Van Sant, who used Elliot Smith's lonesome ballads to pull heart strings in "Good Will Hunting," uses some of Miles Davis' most solitary and contemplative music to accopmany his film on writting. In fact the last track on the album "In A Silent Way" musically parallels the act of writting and thinking. The song is complex but gentle and features Miles at his creative, post-fusion best. "In A Silent Way," and all the tracks on this album (some by Bill Frissel) are like well behaved children, evoking all the complexities and beauty of life yet demanding no atttention or energy. perfect music to accompany the solitary act of writting or just a quiet day.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The Great Napoleon. I hail Napoleon Bonaparte as having been a truly recgonized conqueror of modern times. A&E'e Biographly did help to clear- up some points, that I had failed to fully understand during my reading about him.

All in all, I think it was a well produce portrait, of one of the three greatest men in all the history of this world.bevil$LABEL$1,0,-100
Another Sopranos ripoff. Charles Stella writes like another goombah wannabe. His storyline was amatuerish and the prose was child like.

Very Poorly Organized. This is one of the most poorly laid out language books I have studied from. First of all, I would like to state that languages are not my forte and I am not a natural at linguistics. Vietnamese is the fifth language I have studied and this book has made it most frustrating. The vocabulary is scattered all over each chapter rather than concisely at the beginning or end like better organized books. The glossary often does not have words the reader is looking for when they have forgotten them chapters later. There are also a few typographical errors in the answer key which further confuse the student.Also, table of contents only lists the titles of the chapters and does not list subtopics or chapter objectives. So if the student wants to reference a certain language point, he/she has to remember which chapter it was from then comb the chapter to find it.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great Sound for not so much money. I've own them for 5 years now, they still sound excellent, very good for listening music at home, but not very recomendable for going out with them (must handle with care). They will improve A LOT the sound out of your mp3 player, cd player and you can enjoy the full potential of a nice home stereo system.My ears do tend to hurt a bit after 2 hours with them, but that's enought time for me. Bass is incredible for the size they have, mid's are perfectly clear and hi tones are crispy, well defined and not ear piercing. Give them a try, you wont regret it.

Dungeons and Dragons 2. I also saw the Screener today and thought it was far superior in everyway than the first, well apart from the special effects but they were still believeable. This is how the first movie should have been, The script, the acting and the atmosphere, in fact everything about this film is better than the first. Great interaction between the Rogue and Barbarian. Damidar is actually believeable in this film, Great references to actually DnD and we get to see alot of magic not just the magic dust from the first movie. Very big improvement on the first and alot more serious (no more snails, GREAT) i definately reccommend it.

stated 5 yr warranty is a hoax.

Workouts were just okay, but style is a dud. This is one of the worst put together exercise videos that I have ever seen. For starters, everyone else failed to mention that the camera moves while Michelle is moving. This makes you really dizzy just watching.Second, there is hardly any explanation given. Even if you're like me and watch it once beforehand to see what the workout is like, it's really hard to follow.Third, everything felt too rushed. In the pilates segment, for a brief moment you can see one of the cameramen holding up fingers to show Michelle how many repetitions were left. I guess we all know what she's interested in: hurrying up to go somewhere else.A much better 10 minute mix-and-match workout series is the QuickFix series.$LABEL$0,0,-100

There is always 2 sides to a story. I adored this book! I couldn't put it down. I chose it because I heard the musical was up for a Tony or two and I was looking for a new book to read. Since this book was referring to The Wizard of Oz and someone made a musical out of it I was expecting a light-hearted story with humor scattered about like peanut shells at a steak house. But it is not. I was pleasantly surprised by it's deep story...love, betrayal, jealously, friendship, racism, politics and sex...oh-la-la! It could be a soap opera. I loved it! I couldn't help but imagine the characters as they look in Fleming's movie, especially towards the ill fated end. It is a strange feeling changing your allegiance from one team to another...i.e. Glinda is now bad to me, Dorothy a pawn and don't get me started on the Wizard! :) I just bought Son of a Witch yesterday and can't wait to see what happens in the land of Oz!$LABEL$1,0,-100

omg & wtf!. i bought this dvd set at a huge discount. i remember the series was out years ago and never followed it. and i got to say, what a mess. although based on a graphic novel, or comic, it seems like oliver stone's answer to Twin Peaks that finished up earlier. stone was clearly trying to imitate Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet and bombed in so doing. i'm amazed at how many positive reviews this has. none of the actors were strong, the music was over dramatic, using everything from Bethoven's 7th to the Animals and Rolling Stones. angie dickinson as a thug? come on! it was embarrassing to watch her: gouge someone's eyes out, bitch slap and gut punch another. cattrell was equally miscaste and her dramatic cry of "it's my baby!" was laughable. in trying to be bizarre, it failed miserably. there isn't any level that i would recommend this series. buy it used if you must waste your money.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Do not buy this book. 1) This book is outdated. 310-25 is an old exam. You are better off passing the new one - 310-035.2) The book contains some serious errors. For example, here is an excerpt from the page 146:"Polymorphism ... in object oriented programming, refers to the capability of objects to have many methods of the same name, but different types of arguments. The print() and println() methods of the PrintStream class are excellent examples of polymorphism".This definition of polymorphism is just plain WRONG.3) I cannot say anything about the second part related to the 310-027 exam.4) A good book to buy to prepare for the 310-035 exam:Sun Certified Programmer & Developer for Java 2 Study Guide (Exams 310-035 & 310-027) by Kathy Sierra (she is a co-developer of the SCJP 1.4 exam 310-035) and Bert Bates.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Still hilarious after all these years. The DVD of Mr. Hulot's Holiday will have you chortling, snickering and flat-out laughing all by yourself.

An insult to Morrison and his fans. Stephen Davis seems to have done his research in gossipy internet chat rooms and other places where old rumors are kicked around for years, the more scandalous the better. Davis has simply taken a lot of really old stories from previously published sources, thrown in a couple of interviews with people no one's ever heard of before, and is presenting it as new revelation. It's not. This is just the same old silly stories packaged up between fancy new covers. Fans won't learn anything about the real Morrison or what really happened to him. All they'll get is a lot of reheated gossip that wasn't worth the paper it was written on the first time it was published -- or the second, or the third, or the...

Where are the Sheik's?. Guests of the Sheik : An Ethnography of an Iraqi Village by Elizabeth Fernea is a very old book, published first in 1965 and then 1969. A lot of major things have taken place in Iraq since then including the Gulf War and in its aftermath the strangling sanctions, so I find that the book although it has a catchy title does little to reflect what life in an Iraqi village is like or has been in the last decade. Although in Islam Polygamy is permitted with certain restrictions to label the whole of Iraq or even a whole village as a "polygamous society" is a stretch of the imagination.

half great. I was never a fan of the New Kids but I love Jordan's voice and half-love his neo-soul CD. The Jimmy Jam-Terry Lewis cuts really outshine the other stuff, although Finally Finding Out and the Thom Bellish When You're Lonely are very good. Next time, Jordan, hire Jam and Lewis to steer the entire enterprise. You make a great team. They get many more interesting shades out of your already interesting voice. P.S.

This novel gets a Raspberry from me. Disappointing, disappointing, and what do you know, disappointing! That just about sums up my feelings towards this book after doggedly ploughing through the entire thing. Obviously, literary talent isn't hereditary in the Rice family. I havn't read crime thrillers since many moons ago, so when I decided to pick one up again and decided on Snow Garden, I thought I was in for a night of exciting action. I was proven wrong. By the time I had gotten through a quarter of the book, I knew it was a lost cause. Granted, one shouldn't be expecting beautiful lyrical prose in thrillers and in-depth character delineation, but surely one shouldn't be served with truckloads of surfacial details (e.g. about art), attempts at creating multitudious oh-so-quirky homosexual relationships and a plot that sinks to abysmal depths!! Seriously, if Chris Rice has any writing ability at all, I hope he shows it soon. This novel is a very disappointing showcase of his talent (if any).$LABEL$0,0,-100

I had never even heard of it and just happened to stumble upon it at BLOCKBUSTERS because a friend had given me a free movie card and I had some time to kill.The young actor who played the lead should have WON an Academy Award. The film should be, in my books, equally as respected, lauded and appreciated as SCHINDLER'S LIST, SOPHIE'S CHOICE, or ANY other film about the horrors of the German concentration camps of World War II.I believe so strongly in this film thay I'm buying it for my home DVD library and will encourage everyone I know to see it.

Horrible for more than one-time use.... I purchased a four pack of these razors because I prefer a razor with a wider handle and multiple blades. Despite the wide handle, the razors slipped from my hand easily. The multiple blades also didn't help- they did not shave the hair that closely, but close enough to cut the skin and give razor burn. On the first use, they were decent, but throughout shaving, I had to constantly tap the razor head on the side of the shower to remove the hair that was stuck in there. Even then, there was still quite a bit of hair stuck in there as well as shaving cream, so any subsequent use of the razor would be pointless. Also, the head of the razor does not turn very well to follow the skin. Save your money and buy a different brand.$LABEL$0,0,-100

My College Thesis. This is very slow read. And why? Because interspersed into the verbiage are so many references to other works it just slows the reader down. It is also very redundant.

Simply quaint. Luckily, nothing momentous happened when the year 2000 came to be, and we can now crawl out from under rocks and out of bomb shelters and openly laugh at our now silly-seeming fears. Or maybe it's just James Garner. Aside from a few interesting gags and factoids, the humour of this Y2K spoof is muddled and repetitive. The chapters cover literally everything from divination to prophecy to Y2K preparations (not to mention the significance of the year MM to McDonalds Corporation), but I couldn't bring myself to anything bigger than a quaint smile.This book is not for the devout believers.

unreliable and hard to use - thumb down. Do not buy. It crashed several times on a plain Dell 8600. Very hard to use, like for example to set up rooms, because (1) there are no anchor points; should be able to anchor a corner and then drag a corner; (2) we cannot lock a room in place; while editing a room, another room resized; (3) there is no alignment among rooms; rooms should align sometimes, because they may share a common wall; (4) while working with a room, we cannot specify the type of wall; and so on. It has some sexy colors and menus, but after trying to use it for several times and coming out with no results, the next step is 'uninstall'.$LABEL$0,0,-100

My favorite skillet. I use this more than any other pan in my cabinet. It's easy to clean, it stays in good condition, and it's big enough for most everything I need to cook. I cook eggs, sear meat, cook burgers, etc., in this. My sister bought this as a gift for me a few years ago. She got it at Macy's and I think she paid $60 or more for it. I love this pan, but I think it is more reasonably priced here on amazon for around $30+. Macy's overpriced it. But I'm getting good use out of this skillet. I am thinking of buying another one. If I do, it'll be from Amazon, as long as they're still selling it. I highly recommend this for your everyday use. I also like the side handles as opposed to the regular one handle.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Breaks right out of the box. Opened it up and tried it. The plastic rod connected to the brush broke in less than 60 seconds trying to use it to clean the dryer vent. The rod does not have a metal core....just plastic, so when it is bending in the dryer vent....it broke, leaving the brush head inside the vent. Had to remove the entire vent and fish the head out. Would not recomend this product at all.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Perfect guidebook for a memorable culinary journal. Joan Peterson, the culinary mistress of the EAT SMART series, returns to feed our continuing love affair with foreign foods and flavors in her latest book, Eat Smart in Morocco. As much a travel guide as it is a cookbook, Peterson shares her knowledge of the history and cultural significance of native dishes as well as the traditions and secrets of Moroccan cooks. Her culinary tribute to the land and its people should be part of an official welcome packet given to every foreign visitor when they first step on Moroccan soil. As she writes, "What better way to know a culture than through its cuisine." Particularly helpful to travelers are her bilingual menu, and food and flavor guides. Whether you're a novice or experienced traveler, Eat Smart in Morocco is the perfect reference for a memorable culinary journey. --Kimberly Ouhirra, President, Exotica Oils, Inc.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Love, love, love Zipfizz!. I am not a huge fan of flavored waters or other water enhancers. To me they never have enough flavor. Zipfizz is totally different!

Troublesome Monitor. This may be the worst electronic gadget we've ever owned. The biggest problem is with the sound quality of the monitor itself. On one channel we get major static, on the other channel we get a high-pitched background whine with occasional tapping sounds which come through loud and clear. It sounds like someone clapping and it's very disconcerting to hear that coming from the baby's room in the middle of the night. We can't hear the baby unless we're so close we don't need the monitor. We're also having the same trouble other reviewers have had with the "light show" coming on spontaneously. On the whole, we're not happy with this product.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not bad!!!. I've been playing the Madden NFL series for a long time and the 2002 version is significantly better than the 2001 version. The improved graphics and gameplay (A.I is smarter now) makes it fun and challenging. The scoreboards in the stadium now reflect actually time left in quarter, the actual score and other stats of the down.What was disappointing was the fact that they used very much the same sound bites from the 2001 version so the color commentary is boring to someone who has played previous versions. Sometimes the color commentary makes no sense whatsover.Overall, a good upgrade but beware of the system requirements. You need RAM and a good graphics card loaded with RAM as well.$LABEL$1,0,-100

To boot, one of the critics on this book also rated on an ironing press. see there you go im playing your stupid f**cked game of slander now, where instead of working to make things better or god forbid say something positive about anything, besides conservatives loveing america, instead blaming our problems on moores weight.

Don't waste your money!. I should have known better to buy any product with only 5 reviews, but I decided to buy this anyway. It sounded like a great book from the description and reviews. I was a littled concerned that I couldn't preview the book at all but I figured it was because it was a cookbook. This book was awful! Be prepared to eat white rice 1-2 times a week! I have already returned the book but if i remember correctly, one of the recipes was chicken baked with Catalina dressing on it. I was seriously dissapointed. Every week you ate white rice and some kind of chicken "burger". The book talks to like you have no intelligence at all and like you have never made a grocery list in your life. This book is a waste of money and if I could give it 0 stars, I would. This is a book for somebody who has never cooked a day in their life. Don't buy!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Extremely disappointing. I found this story to be too confused and busy. It meanders between characters until it brings them all together later on in the book, but it just seems like the brief moments of actual "action" are just huge build-ups of anticipation with an anti-climatic little *pop* of dénouement. In short, nothing's happening to keep me interested! The characters are fantastic, the author's descriptive powers are beyond compare, but there's just no story there.I tend to like a good vampire fic to keep me shivering for a night or two. This one has kept me groaning night after night trying to finish it for almost three weeks (an exhaustively long time for me to finish a book). Ghost, Steve, Nothing, Christian, and Brite's version of the Stygian triplets are all rich, wonderful characters. Now if only she'd done something with them....Disappointing, especially after all the good I'd heard about this author.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Mom's Best Friend. I received this steamer for Christmas last year. My son was 6 months old at the time. I started steaming food for him that I could make into baby food. Now I use the steamer 2-3 times per week for the whole family. It is so easy to throw vegetables in one side and potatoes in the other and start the timer. I don't have to wait for water to boil or over cook things while I chase my toddler. I only saw one other steamer that cooks two items side by side and it did not compare to this steamer.I have never used another steamer and this one is pricey, but the corn on the cob, broccoli, and lobster made in this steamer is the best I have ever tasted!$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Dance Classic. American Sharon Redd was the diva of choice for serious UK clubbers in the early 80s. Redd, at one time a member of Bette Midler's "Harlettes", managed to obtain British chart success long before Midler did. This album, one of three she recorded for the Prelude label, contains the majority of her UK hit singles. The production on this album is stunning as is Redd's deep, rich voice. The biggest hit, "Never Give You Up" is a dancefloor monster, a once heard/never forgotten experience. Redd was equally adept at ballads, as "Takin' A Chance On Love" will demonstrate. Sadly, Redd died in 1992, and yet again, a great voice was silenced. This CD is a must for those into great dance music, and great voices.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Useful information with research-based foundation. This is the first book that I have read that provides me with the information to confront the problems associated with instilling intrinsic motivation in those that I manage. It is often the problem that people show little concern for their work. The rule seems to be something like this- Do just enough to get by while exerting the least energy as possible. I like this book because the information is not a story of what a good manager has as an opinion as to what works best but it is a scholarly book in the sense that it provides information based on research that is proven. This is to date the best book that I have to reference when dealing with teams that act out of extrinsic motivation or no motivation at all. I applaud the author for this work.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not bad at all. The phone is actually pretty good for the price. (At first I was a little skeptical.) Everyone knows that there are pros and cons for just about anything. Some of the cons for the phone would be the static (which is minor if the phone is charged), and the fact that it is incompatible with Caller ID. (but who needs the extra expense anyway?). The pros would be the different ringers, the fun color, the fact that you can use headphones, the any-key answer, the pre-set speed dials, and the pager. (I really like the pager because it beeps until you find it-or at least for a couple of minutes- when most phones usually stop after a few beeps). I have even taken this phone into the backyard without extra static. So, if you are looking for a decent phone for a good price then this one's for you (works especially good for a teenage or college student)$LABEL$1,0,-100

Outdated and of Little Use, (Comment from a concerned Sgt). This 1994 question book is of little value. The book that it is suppose to be modeled after, "Supervision of Police Personnel" has changed significantly since 1994. This study guide of the past consists of confusing questions with no explanations. It is not a study guide and certainly cannot replace the text book, unless you don't mind doing poorly on a promotional exam. Since the page numbers and the chapters have changed in the actual text book, I found this book to be very frustrating. Save your mental energy.$LABEL$0,0,-100

excellant replacement buckle. this is a review for the 2 inch side release buckle-black. this is a replacemnet for the waist buckle on my army heavy transport MOLLE back pack. the previous buckle had been stepped on so i definatly needed a new one and a replacement. the other reviewer said that "They cheaped out and put the webbing grip only on 1 side of the buckle" BUT he is wrong they didnt cheap out its intended that way for a reason. you only need the male end of the buckle to grip the webbing so that in a case where u need to get your pack on or off quick you dont have to deal with adjusting the female end tighter or looser just slide and clip. this buckle is very good and while i cant say it will stand up to a 250 pound guy stepping on it it will keep your pack NICE AND TIGHT$LABEL$1,0,-100
Looks good, but not practical for long-term use. I purchased this product and wrote a review about it in another review page for the same item. In a nutshell: the bolts are round, but the bolt openings in the riser are wide and oval -- and after day-to-day usage this poor attachment design makes the riser shift out of place. Unlike a toilet seat, you will never be able to tighten this toilet seat riser enough to prevent it from moving.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Yet another shiny piece of junk toaster. What's funny is other reviewers either love this thing or hate it. Nothing in between. I'm going to guess the lovers like light toast and the haters like dark toast. I'm very particular about my toast, and I'm a hater...This thing looks shiny and cool, but toasts bread unevenly--it burns one tip of the bread and leaves the opposite unheated!!!! I think it has too much empty space and not enough elements for even toasting. The early release lever takes a struggle to operate. Then it flings the toast onto the counter, which is great for cartoons but not for reality. And the oven part has no timer so it's burned everything I've ever put in it.If you want toast, the best thing to do nowadays is buy the cheapest and smallest toaster you can find--once a year. They're all made in China, they're all junk, and few of them last more than a year. I bet Chinese don't even eat toast!$LABEL$0,0,-100

History of Newton County, Mississippi 1834-1894. An excellent study of pertinent facts relating to the early history of Newton County, Mississippi. A. J. Brown uses many sources to inform his reader, including verbal interviews of residents of Newton County, court records, federal census records, state records and newspaper accounts. This book is of interest to those who wish to learn more about early settlers of Newton County, and what life was like for citizens after the Civil War. It does not touch upon every family. The primary focus is on those the writer believes are the leading citizens, therefore, those seeking a comprehensive study of this area may be disappointed. However, this history does provide a general feel for the time and place with some detailed discussion.Charlotte GressettGenealogy researcher$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Grotesque Caricature. Tom Wolfe clearly has not been to college in the last 50 years, because his portrait of college life is so vastly overblown and beleaguered with every stereotype assigned to today's world of higher education that the story itself is completely lost. There is little that is original or even interesting is his truly one-dimensional novel about a girl who can only be characterized as the single most nave college student on the planet, complemented by every jock and frat boy stereotype that exists in nature. I happen to be familiar with the university this novel is based on and I can say that he appears not to have really delved fully into his research in regard to what college life is like there. I feel a more realistic and not so oversexed and oversimplified novel could have been a successful book. But this just reeks of an old man outside his generation grasping at what he thinks people want to read about college life.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Very disappointed..Buy the book. I'd wanted to see the movie for some time now and was given the book as a gift. The book itself was pretty good but was so descriptive it ruined the movie for me. I finished the book on Sunday and decided to rent instead of buying the movie on Wednesday. I was excited to see the movie but was instantly disappoint. It deviated from the book a little which was fine but the story seemed to go so fast; trying to fit as much into an hour and a half as possible. I'm a fan of all of the actresses d absolutely loved the acting of Sophie Okonedo, who played the part of sister May. All in all the movie was both over and under-acted.I don't know if I would have liked the movie had I not read the book.

This book might blow you away.... ...with it's ability to explain this twist of nature at a level young children can understand. I was most impressed with the fact that not only does it describe the scientific aspects of tornado formation in simple terms, it also discusses tornado safety by giving kids several examples of where they might be when a tornado hits and the best place to take cover for each situation. While the publisher lists ages 4-8 as the targeted reading level, I found with our library groups at school that our 9-11 year olds were very interested in it as well. If you have younger children and live in an area where tornadoes are a real threat, I highly recommend using this book to introduce tornado safety.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Broke on First Use. Rather than push out the pin in the chain link, the tool's pushpin sheared in half.I suspect that part may have been defective, though, and this review isn't a blanket condemnation of the Super tool or Topeak.The reason why is, I was able to complete the chain repair using the chain tool included in my Topeak Alien II multitool. No problem with that one. So Topeak can make a chain tool that works. I might have just gotten a bum pushpin in my Super.I bought the Super in the first place because I figured the chain tool in the Alien II would be flimsy. The Alien II chain tool was to be a backup, and it performed well.I'll probably replace this with the more expensive Park CT-3, though.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Should have been better. Room 33 is about a troubled young couple and a roller derby team who get stranded in an abandoned mental hospital where a crazy girl is running around and people are turning up dead sans eyeballs. Good luck figuring out much of anything beyond that. I guess the actual killer is supposed to be the crazy chick's dead father who is living on as one of her multiple personalities and was the head doctor at this place. Why is he dead? Got me. Why is he killing people? No idea. Too bad the script is such a mess, because they had the makings of a decent b-horror flick for the first half. The girls were cute and you start to care about some of them. The acting is poor but not offensive, it was filmed pretty well, but the script and plot holes are what really hurt it.

Slick Little Camera. The value of this camera is its size and convenience. It does not take great photos, but for the most part, outdoor pix are not too bad. I compared exact shots from my olympus 2 and 3 megapixel, and the colors from the casio were a little washed out- not true to color. Indoor shots with low light are bad, as the flash is so small it does not produce very good photos. These are the drawbacks. I got this camera to have when I don't want to carry my larger camera and to take places that I would not otherwise have taken the other. It is cool and will draw a crowd. You will need to get an additional SD card if you want to take any number of pix, but they are cheap now. Final note, the usb/charging cradle that came with it is very nice and works well- I did not install any of their software as Win XP immediatley picked up and installed the driver.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Utilitarian Headphones. Darn good head phones if you have that remarkable ability to break everything you own. The ear pieces are quite sturdy, made of aluminum. At first are awkward to put on, but once you get them "set" they don't even feel there. Comes with a nice case, too big for a pants pocket but good for a jacket pocket or purse. Sound quality is decent, these aren't DJ quality headphones, mainly due to the lack of bass; overall sound quality is crisp and clear. And lastly, the ear pieces are not heavy enough to use as a bolo, so home defense is out of the question for this item. However, if you are an assassin, the wire seams strong enough to work as a garote.$LABEL$1,0,-100

So nice to have pancakes again. After weeks on the limited choices in Atkins, trying this mix was nice alternative to eggs every morning! The consistency was a little chewy and the taste quite egg-y, but with sugar-free maple syrup I was still in heaven with every bite. I also sprinkled on some cinnamon for flavor. However, next time I'll try reducing to one egg instead of two, and see if this helps cut down the egg-iness. Not bad overall!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Detailed Method For Buckskins. The author took the complex task of making buckskins and makes it even harder by explaining the most minute details of the process. I was looking for more step by step detail on hide tanning. This book will be great for you if you really want every detail explained. I would have given this book 5 stars if it simply had an an appendix at the end of the book with step by step instructions of the process, but with much of the verbage removed.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Don't Buy AT&T phones, AT&T doesn't Back Their Product. I purchased this phone through ANTOnline. (AT&T; E5917).The answering system is OK but the cordless handset was defective. I contacted AT&T; and we both determined (AT&T; and I) that they phone was defective and they told me I had to contact ANTOnline. I contacted ANTOnline and they told me to contact AT&T; directly, so I tried emailing AT&T.; After giving AT&T; information back and forth in the email they told me to contact them through the phone. And around and around it goes. I cannot waste anymore of my time for a $10 handset. I am very disappointed in AT&T; and find that their customer service is not what it used to be. So let the buyer beware -- cannot return defective items!!!!$LABEL$0,0,-100
This has got to be a joke!. Thought I'd check out what 'death metal' is about, so listened to the track samples for this album - unbelievable! I'm astonished that anyone in their right mind could find pleasure in listening to this horrendous noise - 'music' is hardly an appropriate descriptive term here. So, if this band is at all representative of the genre, my advice to the uninitiated is: steer well clear if you like your ears! For a real 'Brainstorm' check out the track of this name on Hawkwind's 'Doremi Fasol Latido' album.$LABEL$0,0,-100

She Loves (LOVES) this thing!. I sincerely believe I could have dumped Baby Jaguar, his cast, the tapir, the feeding dish, XRay and the stethescope and just given my daughter the Rescue Pack without batteries and she would have fallen in love with it. The other toys have largely been ignored in favor of the RP. Unfortunately, the thing came with pre installed batteries and all we've heard for the last couple of days is that thing talking.As a note, we got one of these for our son about 2 years ago. He also loved it. I have no idea what happened to it, but I rated this as highly durable because I know it lasted a long time before it vanished. His Baby Jaguar is still around...$LABEL$1,0,-100

Totally wrong ending. Have you ever read a book that was absolutly perfect untill the end? The end of this book destroys the whole point of the fairy tale. I was so disapointed. It seemed that McKinley just threw everything together to create an ending. I was so excited, this book was so good untill the last two or three chapters. Then it just disgusted me. I would write a whole new ending for this book and then it would be perfect. But unless you want to write your own ending, don't waste time or money on this book. I must say though, that the sisters were great and I loved the way she wrote them. That was actually worth my time. I gave a star to each of them.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great idea, until it broke.. I purchased this exactly a year ago and have used it on a few trips. I was on a cross-country trip last week and used the unit for about the tenth time. It broke. As I pushed the plunger down I heard a crack. I now have coffee in between the inner and outer shells of the mug. Sadly, I will throw this away and purchase a better-quality unit for my travels. Nothing is better than having a good cuppa while on the road, and nothing was worse than that crack I heard, making this unit useless.I have two Bodum glass presses at home that I use several times a day; they continue to perform yeoman service.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Very Unrealistic. I bought this book because other customer reviews raved about how wonderful it was. Well, I was very disappointed. It was so awful, I couldn't even read the book all the way through. The book is almost entirely made up of sample conversations that show you how you should be talking with your children. Unfortunately, the children in these conversations are unlike any child I know. In the book, the three-year-olds talk more like ten-year-olds. It is very unrealistic. I would give it zero stars if I could. I sent the book back.$LABEL$0,0,-100
a good change of hero and heroine. It was a good read. It kept me interested in the beginning, but started to become predictable towards the end. You were still able to connect with and understand what the charcters were going through. It just kinda lost its fizz after awhile like soda when you leave it out. I wish the outcome was different in the end. It left me wondering WHAT? No way! After all that... it ends like this?This book had potential to be better, I wish it were.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Junk Player. I will never by this brand. I ordered this player month back. After waiting for 20 days, I received the player.When I tried to play a DVD movie, only first ten minutes it played the movie in color, then color changed to pink and finally it displayed only Black and White.I called Cyberhome support, I did all kind of troubleshooting as per cyberhome supports instruction. No luck. Then I called Amazon, they said they will replace the unit.Last week I receive the my replacement unit. I think this unit is comparatively better. The reason is, it displayed the DVD movies in color for 20 to 30 minutes. And it goes to pink and finally Black and White.Today I am returning this unit also.It you check Cyberhome's web site support page, they say it you see pink are Black and White picture adjust the DVD setup. That is not true. It didn't work for the player I got it.This player is not even worth for single star.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Disapointing. I loved the New Mickey Mouse Club from season 1, even as new episodes were showing while I was still in high school. I was very excited to see that Disney was releasing this, even if it were only a few episodes based around three of the many talented kids on the show. The fond memories I have that revolve around this show...However, the four episodes on this DVD did not highlight the talent of Christina, Britney and Justin or the rest of the cast for that matter. All the musical numbers (except one) were prerecorded from the MMC concert. The skits were not some of the best, but Keri Russel fans will probably get a kick out of seeing her in many of the episodes. I hope people who buy this DVD don't judge the entire show on these four episodes.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Absolute worst customer service. We had major problems with our after-market radio. The installers tried a new radio that Sirius sent and a new antenna that they sent. Neither helped. My wife then called customer service and that was a huge mistake. She spent 2 hours being bounced around and hung up on. It was as if they didn't care about our business in any shape or form. Then they would say things like "I don't see any orders on your account so I can't help you." What does that even mean? They wanted to send another of the same model but we had already been through all that.In the end it was easier to cancel the service and eat all the money we'd put into it so far than to deal with them. Customer service/retention/tech support would not do anything for us. The radio service is great if it works, but if it doesn't, may the gods help you because Sirius won't.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Ransom. This is the worst Lois Duncan Book I have ever read!

Second pair and counting.... I bought my first pair and loved them, now on second pair and still love them. Sturdy, forgiving but still rugged. Break in is fairly quick and I only have a little discomfort initially with the upper ankle area. This is due to the stiff rubber/plastic that wraps the ankle. I do not mind the break in period as this same piece offers good ankle support also. Only drawback is the price, ouch. I have never paid $200.00 which is the price at the time of this review as they are usually around 129.00 to 169.00.Overall a good boot and I also prefer them to the Acadia.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Well worth the $. I would highly recommend this video for those looking to tone and slim but who don't want to spend too much time working out. Each workout is only 25 minutes and it is broken down into three circuits, plus a warm up and cool down. In each circuit 3 minutes are dedicated to strength training, 2 minutes to cardio, and 1 minute to abdominal work. This format makes it easy for quitters like me to push through a hard work-out since I know whatever I'm having trouble with will be over soon. The three different workouts keep things interesting and pack a punch. The only improvement would be an extended cool down period -- I often need to stretch more afterwards.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A book that will appeal to the envy of America. 200 years ago, European nations dominated the world in absolutely every aspect-culturally, economically, militarily, etc. Now, in the 21st Century, the tables have dramatically changed across the Atlantic. The U.S. is now the strongest superpower the world has ever seen. For the first time in history, there is a nation out there with the might and influence greater than Europe COMBINED. If one doesn't believe me, just look the stats up and compare them. One example would be that the US spends more on its military and on technology than the rest of the world COMBINED, let alone old Europe. And people wonder why the most high-tech nation on Earth...$LABEL$0,0,-100

A week later and my Mx500 arrived..this is where the problem started. I noticed the pointer moves in random directions when you move the mouse slowly. I thought that this was because the mouse had some tiny scratches on it. So i cleaned it and used it again..no luck.Today i went to staples to have it exchanged for a similar mousepad.

Elsie's story continues. This is the fifth book in a series, though this and the fourth book didn't have too much to do with the first three books. The first three - 'Fourth Grade Wizards', 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade', and 'Sixth Grade Can Really Kill You', were set in elementary school, but the last two books focused on Elsie Edwards.Elsie made her first appearance in 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade' and was in the next book, though with a considerably smaller role.

Only use if you are an octopus!. I was so excited to get this wrap. My baby constantly wanted to be held and I thought this would make us both happy. I was very wrong. It arrived and when I opened it I knew we were going to have issues. It came with a very thick instruction manual and the option to watch a video online. Still, I gave it a try. Many tries. The thing is very very long. First you have to fold it in half lengthwise, then you have to drape it this way and that way, pick up and position the baby, then wrap and tie it. Perhaps if I had eight arms or someone to help me, this would have worked. However, after using it a few times, I returned it.

The Best Point-n-shoot I have ever used. I love its portability, ease-of-use and picture quality. It has enough options to control exposure, timings, color temp etc for a amateur photographer. (The 5-star ratings are keeping in mind what I expect from a point-n-shoot camera. Obviously the picture quality is not as good as a SLR.) I have used it extensively and loved every bit of it. Except recently, when it died due to lens error. I guess some particles (sands?) got stuck in the lens system. Now it fails to start. The repairing cost is not justified.

If I could give it a ZERO, I would!!. This is the worst phone I have ever owned...and I've had many. Sure, it's cute and light, but the phone is constantly dropping calls, gets TERRIBLE reception, decides not to ring when it feels like it and the battery life is about 36 hours with no talking and about 24 hours if you talk for about 1-2 hours (in battery save mode). I certainly would NOT recommend this phone to anyone. I had a Motorola before this which was absolutely wonderful, even after I dropped it in my dog's water dish! I thought this phone would be equally as great, but I'm very disappointed!! With my old phone I had perfect reception everywhere in my apartment, now I have to stand by the window and most times this phone won't ring in the apartment at all.The things that I do like over my old phone is the option to have true tones and it takes better pictures.

Have you heard of tunnel vision?. This book is very disappointing. I was even appalled at the nerve of the author to re-release this book and identify the man he THINKS is the Zodiac killer after the man's death. The author actually demonstrates how an investigation can get botched with tunnel vision. A prime suspect is the sole focus and evidence is distorted any way it can be to "prove" this suspect is the Zodiac killer. There were other possible leads and suspects that were discounted by the author.By the time you reach the middle of the book, you'll see it is already obvious who the author THINKS is the Zodiac killer. The rest of the book discounts other leads and suspects and focuses on "evidence" that "proves" the author has identified the Zodiac Killer. Very disheartening.It should be noted the author is not an investigator and the identity of the Zodiac killer remains a mystery to this day.

Epson R2400 Print Results. I purchased the R2400 from B&H, NYC. After a brief installation set up, I was ready to print. The images came out streaking from upper right to bottom left. After speaking to Epson tech support I was instructed by them to return the unit because"it should not be streaking diagonally, ecspecially right out of the box". I exchanged the unit with another one and experienced the same problem. Whether I printed from photshop or iphoto the streaks continued on 99% of my prints (with Epson paper). After trading emails w/ Epson tech. support, I ended up returning the 2nd unit as well. Maybe I hit a bad batch but the R2400 was for me, an exercise in frustration.$LABEL$0,0,-100
THIS IRON IS NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!. I purchased this flat iron from Amazon EXACTLY 60 days ago and this morning, when I plugged it in the red light turned on.....when I came back to straighten my hair a little while later, the light was off and the iron was cool. After going to work with frizzy hair I returned home to try it again...no luck. I should have listened to the other negative reviews on this site. The iron is not covered by the warranty because it was purchased from Amazon, not an authorized hair salon! I took my chances when ordering the iron because the price was right....Buyer BEWARE, spend a few more dollars and buy it from a hair salon. Ulta Beauty has the iron for a similar price when it's on sale! Like some other reviewers I think this is a cheaper version of the ones that sell in salons. My daughter has the Paul Brown flat iron and it's been great for over a year!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Kids Enjoy the Content. This was purchased for two little ones, ages 2 and 1. The content features Pim, an animated panda, intermixed with footage of children and parents in everyday situations. Basic objects and actions are introduced then repeated several times before being used in simple phrases and sentences. There is a menu option to see English subtitles. It would be great (for adults) if there was also an option to see the Chinese vocabulary spelled out phonetically in English.

The mob-busters' point of view. Written by two of the FBI agents who in 1981 bugged the home of mob boss Paul Castellano, head of New York's Gambino famiy, Boss of Bosses is a nail-biter that keeps you on the edge of your seat. We follow them as they place their surveillance equipment and then monitor Castellano's day-to-day activities. Along the way they pick up juicy information about the boss's personal life, particularly his love for the family maid and the lengths he will go to please her. Some readers have complained that the book is more soap opera than true crime, but I think that's a big part of its strength. The authors show the godfather as a real man not just a power on a Mafia throne. The book is also good background on the conditions within the family that led to Castellano's assassination and the ascent of John Gotti.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The Best Book on the Subject of Spot Metering!. Too many photo "how to" books slide right over the importance of metering, especially spot metering. You wonder why your photos lack the detail and color that your remembered when you shot that picture. This book is wonderful. It is the only book that I have come across that explains in great detail how the camera works and how to determine the exposure you desire using the spot meter. You will be amazed at how much better your photos will be if you turn off that automatic stuff and let your brain decide what your exposure should be. After you have read those books about aperture, shutter speed and depth of field (they all seem to read the same), read this book to learn how to expose/meter correctly. I am so glad that I did!$LABEL$1,0,-100

What the ????. This CD is filled with poor choices from the beginning, but I'm wondering if anyone experienced what I have? My tracklisting is totally off! The CD cover warns one to refer to the booklet inside for correct track listing (which moves song #15 (I Need You) to song #3, thus placing "Lost" in 4th position. So..when you play the CD the song titles do not match the song that's playing. After song #3 you're always going to be off by one song. SO Annoying. You have to go in and manually change the title off each song in your IPOD. Just another dent in an already poor release.$LABEL$0,0,-100

works poorly. The shuffler flips cards over several times during one shuffle so that we have several cards rightside up when we draw. This is disconcerting when playing.

A great film, but not a masterpiece. The film noir is an interesting genre. Most are crafted in a brilliant manner but the conclusion of the film seems to fall apart, not to mention some of the explanations make no sense. Chinatown has been considered to have one of the greatest endings ever filmed. While it was good, the denouement of Chinatown was definitely rushed and that hindered the film. L.A. Confidential is another noir film, and while it bears similarities to Chinatown, I feel Confidential is the better film. There are many engaging characters with more humor and action. The plot twists are as intriguing as the ones in Chinatown. The performances, especially Russel Crowe, are outstanding. It would be hard to explain this film in a couple of sentences, so I think you should just watch this movie for yourself. Overall, it is a great film, but a rather hard to believe conclusion hurts it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Yes, that's right, I felt that the book seemed to advise doing exactly as the son or daughter would prefer. I had hoped for a guide to ensuring that certain standards are met, in order to justify the flow of money. You know, like decent grades, reasonable plans for finishing on time, no wasting money on luxury purchases while Mom and Dad are sacrificing to pay tuition, etc. Instead, what I found was a guide to feeling OK about giving up those expectations.

Tecno Joe!. That's right- Joe Satriani has gone techno! With that being said though, this CD is chock full of BLISTERING LEAD WORK. If you are looking for the crunchy metal hooks ala "Surfing With the Alien" or "Crystal Planet", you WILL NOT find them here. The old, worn out metal themes have been replaced with dense textured synths, electronic drums, and synth guitars. This is absolutely the most original guitar recording to come out in a LONG time. The lead work is phenomenal (as usual), but this time it takes on an exotic, improvised jazzy feel. Standout tunes include "Devil Slide" with it's machine gun synth guitar rhythms and dueling solos, the atmospheric Rush styled "Flavor Crystals", and "Borg Sex" which digitally builds to an AWESOME solo climax. Joe certainly had his creative engines running full throttle and if you will listen with an OPEN mind, you will see that he has trailblazed a new path for instrumental guitar.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not the worst I've read -- but it comes close.... Having met Robert Wise, I had high hopes for this novel when I started it. Unfortunately, after less than one chapter I realized that those hopes were ill-founded. "The Dead Detective" lacks all of the things that make novels readable -- interesting characters, snappy dialogue, believable plotlines. Instead, we are given one-dimensional characters, cliche-driven dialogue and a plot which simply never makes sense.I will quantify all of this by saying that, if you have loved every novel in the "Left Behind" series, you might really like Mr. Wise's novels. If, however, you are looking Christian literature on the level of Frank Peretti, Randy Alcorn or Ted Dekker, you should look elsewhere. In the world of Christian fiction, there are many great choices. This simply isn't one of them.$LABEL$0,0,-100

From the same guy who made the ever popular Diwali riddim probably the most popular riddim ever made!! So this would be a great choice for someone who likes dancehall.

pseudo-analytic nonsense. This book is completely useless for a serious web designer. Completely misguided from an aestetics point of view, this book doesn't go further than a pseudo-analysis of design style. Even the "techniques" section is really a couple of "how to copy this" advice, nothing deeper or broader.The novice won't find anything to grasp the essentials or fundamentals of what design really is (or a particular "style" for that matter), the pro will find this useless. Don't even think about usability of cource.There is much more to design than this book suggests and certainly freshness doesn't come from copying a style bound to be trivial in a couple of months but from analysing and deepening in what design for web is.If you come from a design background you are already well equiped so, look for something on usability rather.If you are a novice avoid this copycat approach to design and look for something on the fundamentals.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Horrible and pervasive chemical odor. It is pretty hard to criticize a fitness ball. I have seen this brand at several gyms and the quality seems durable enough. Unfortunately, the ball has such a pervasive and intense odor that it is impossible to keep in your home. I truly can't emphasize this enough. After putting it in the closet, the smell transferred to all of my clothes. Finally, I put it in the hallway of my building (a small 3 story Victorian). Even after a week, the *entire* building smells like this weird chemical odor. And the halls are wide and airy (with no heat). I cringe at the thought of actually bumping into one of my neighbors. I have held off returning this in the hopes that the ball would air out. But no such luck. Returning these items is always a drag, and it is hard not to be just a little resentful at the lack of quality control.$LABEL$0,0,-100

The story line is slow very slow. The main character is a manic depressive woman who is very annoyed with life because it is unfair, and she ended up in the wrong side of the table. So she resents everyone that happened to be lucky enough to avoid life traps and despises those who fell on them.

Not worth the time or money. This book repeats a few of the strategies presented in "The E-Myth Revisted", trying to point them at the contractor. Unfortunately, except for a couple of good ideas from that book, there is nothing here but fluff and pep talk. At one point, I think you can actually tell where material was cut-and-pasted from the sister book about medical practices, where they accidentally forgot to change "practice" to "contracting business".If you found some chapters of the "The E-Myth Revisted" to be a bit fluffy for you, you can count on an entire (although short) book of it here.

Unusual. Brand New is a band that I just do not understand. Lately, I have found myself listening to Deja Entendu frequently on someones itunes playlist on my local network, and I am puzzled. This cd has absolutly no flow at all. Some of the tracks do not even sound like the same band, especially "Play Crack The Sky," which sounds exactly like a Counting Crows song. The good thing about this album is that they aren't doing the exact same thing as every other band in this oversaturated genre. However, much of this seems forced, and that they are trying to hard to be different. I cannot stand the track titles either.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great film noir. I'm watching this film for about the 10th time as I write this. It is an interesting study of vengeance by the father of a murdered girl who comes to America to find and kill her murderers. There is an interesting subplot in which an older and unreleased film by Terence Stamp is used to show the backstory when he was a young man and his daughter was a child. This subplot finally explains what has happened in the modern story. It is similar and far superior to a recent film called "Taken." In both cases, the father, who has near superhuman skills, takes off after a man who has kidnapped or ( in the Limey's case) murdered his daughter. This is a better film but both are enjoyable. I can watch this one over and over. I'm not sure about the newer film.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Excellent introduction leaving one wanting more. This slim volume explores the way that music implements the liturgical intent and, to some extent particularly with the antiphons, the way changes in liturgy are reflected by changes in music. Especially interesting is the segment on the relationship between homilectics and music.The music explored ranges from chant to 20th century - the latter more by reference than by analysis. It includes instrumental music and cantatas as well as the classic music of the Mass.One need not be a musician nor a liturgical historian to understand this book. But reading the book will help a liturgist understand the liturgical musician and the historical development of their role.Highly recommended for anyone involved in liturgical planning.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Making the spiritual journey..... ...and that's not a bad thing!! Kristine W has always managed to stay atop the dance charts by making albums that capture the current musical landscape. This album is no exception. I did notice that Kristine seems to be taking a more "spiritual" attitude in her lyrics. As I was listening, I couldn't help but feel like she was having a real moment as she was singing...like every song sung was a small burden lifted from her shoulders. It is really great when an artist can convey such emotion like that, while treating us to an excellent landscape of danceable musical textures. The additional disc, mixed by Chris Cox, is really well done also. Everything is listenable...and enjoyable. It's highly recommended!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Going through the motions. I'm a big Joseph Finder fan and I have to say that I was very disappointed in his latest novel. I took this book with me on vacation and I have to say it was a chore to get though. The story could have been written in about 200 pages, not this 500 + behemoth. It appears that Mr. Finder was just going through the motions to satisfy his booking agent. The story was so cookie cutter written. It was like some one gave him a formula to follow. The twists and "surprise" ending was so predictable that you had it figured out 50 pages before it happened. Luckily, I had other books with me on the trip to remind me of the magic of reading.

It moves air. My PS3 gets pretty warm in my entertainment center, so I decided to get this to help circulate some air. It does what I intended it to do. I like the fact that it's a USB device. Since I have it plugged into my PS3, it's only on when I have the PS3 turned (I originally plugged it into the powered USB hub that I have hooked up to my PS3, and it stayed on, as there's no power switch.) There is a control knob to adjust the fan speed, which is a nice touch. I noticed several reviews commenting about how quiet this fan is. I suppose it is if you have the power down to 50% or less... When it's cranked up, it makes way more noise than my PS3's fan (which is fairly loud itself!)Over all, it's a nice solid build, and if you're in the market for a USB powered fan, I see no reason why you shouldn't look at this one!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Outward Bound Pet Gear Bag. This product could have been quite functional except that it had a very strong ruber-tire smell which I think would have permeated anything in it or near it. I just couldn't tolerate the smell. Thus, I didn't use it.

Brought my family tree to life. I've recently started researching my family's genealogy and discovered that I'm a direct descendant of Thomas Hill Dougan.

Save your money. I have always wanted to go to Thailand and I bought this DVD in the hope of convincing my husband but I honestly think it had the opposite affect! If you are just planning to go to Bangkok than this DVD may be useful for you as about 2/3rds of the DVD is based on Bangkok. It also shows Chaing Mai but only really covers Thai cooking and massage classes and doesn't really show what there is to do there.I got my hopes up when the DVD moves to the South of Thailand and the islands (the area I am most interested in seeing) but it actually only spent about 7 or 8 minutes on this!I was considering putting my copy back on to sell but I don't think it is very fair to make anyone else suffer through it!I have found the Insight Guides (discovery channel) Thailand book much more interesting and useful and worth the money.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Well written, but forgot about Clark. Ambrose shows his literary expertise as he chronicles the most famous exploring duo in American history. Using journals and other first person witness accounts, the reader is treated to a detailed description of Lewis and Clark's expedition to the pacific. While the research was extensive, Ambrose does relegate Clark to a minor role as he concentrates more on Lewis and Jefferson which would undoubtedly upset Lewis who consistently emphasized the equality of the two captains. The reader should not be surprised, as the title emphasizes this point about the thesis. Despite this pro-Lewis bias, Undaunted Courage is a great resource for information on the Corps of Discovery.$LABEL$1,0,-100

I Like It. I love this book. I had to force myself to but it down so I don't read though it all at once. I find that the characters are very real, and other than the initial event (the Rapture) all of the following events sound realistically possible (in a novel). I have read many negative reviews from Christians denouncing that it doesn't exactly follow the Bible. And from others saying that it's nothing but religious evangelicalism. To all of those I say "It's a novel". It's fiction. It doesn't have to follow other sources and the writers can say what they want.To me it is a perfect mix, not too far out there and not too much preaching.I would recommend it to anyone interested. If you don't like the first book then don't read the rest.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not what is used to be?. I just saw a new one. I have a 30-year-old General No. 36. It was made in the USA, had two round knobs to hold the pivoting arms to the base, and came with two threaded ground-to-a-point pins that went through the base to help hold it in place on rough stock, or which could be reversed to screw into the base from the underside to center the bit on narrow stock. There is absolutely NO runout on the spindle, which fits into precision bushings. I had upgraded the chuck to an LFA to match a professional chuck on the AC-powered drill I usually use with this tool.It sounds like the current production is yet another made-in-China cheapened and downgraded version of what was once a useful tool.

Full of ideas, short on plot, loads of fun!. This book jumps around among multiple characters and multiple times, focusing on crytography during WW2 and the late 1990s. Even so, it is easy to follow. The characters are engaging, the history is interesting, and the book is often hilarious. There is lots of math and computer geekiana, but this doesn't serve as an impediment, even to a reader, like me, with only superficial knowledge of and interest in these things. It's a physically huge book, even in its smallest, mass-market version, but it's still a quick read. At the end, I had trouble summing up the plot, then decided I didn't care. It was a wild ride, and one with a much more satisfying ending than Stephenson's previous novels Snow Crash and The Diamond Age.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Josh Groban in a bad evening. First of all, I'm a huge fan of Josh Groban's. Having listened to all his albums and watched all his DVDs, I got disappointed about Live At The Greek. Unlike many reviewers, the flashes, lights and the rock n'roll atmosphere didn't bother me, at all. The main problem, in my opinion, was his strained and nasal voice, which messed up with a lot of beautiful songs. "Mi Mancherai", "Caruso" and "Alla Luce del Sole" were just unrecognizable. It seems that he was congested and couldn't sing that day, but wasn't able to postpone the performance. Luckily, I've borrowed the DVD and haven't bought it. However, I must acknowledge that he sang beautifully in some parts of the concert. "Oceano", "Remember When It Rained", "My December" and "Never Let Go" were great. The setlist was simply the best of all his concerts. Sorry he wasn't able to make it work that evening.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Don't bother. The reviews I read for this book described it as funny and quirky. It was neither.

Could be Eastwood's best work to date.... This is not a war film that will be accessible to every viewer, especially those who are only used to soaking up the typical American propaganda war films of the past half century. Of course there are going to be those right winged/ 'wannabe pushovers' who will automatically be persuaded to call out this film as: "rewriting history," when, in reality, they have NO clue/ concept of what actually occurred during this part of history from the POV of the Japanese soldiers, (and still consider any "enemy" to the US as nothing more than "savages.") The fact of the matter is, the film is a true masterpiece of artistic cinema. Many people seem to forget the notion that film = art. "Letters" is NOT a documentary film; it is a filmic portrait of a generally unknown/misunderstood piece of modern history. I would say this subtle masterpiece is Eastwood's best work to date. Though I am sure there are those who would disagree.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Even Robin Hood misses his target once in a while. I'm sad to say that I thought Michael Moore's first stab at fictionalized satire is a far cry from the brilliance of everything else he has produced to date. Perhaps someone who doesn't already share Moore's passion for social and economic justice might find the humor in "Canadian Bacon" less obvious than I, but I saw most of the jokes coming from miles away (or kilometers, in the case of the Canadian segments). If you're looking for political satire that is both dangerous AND funny as hell, check out anything else Moore has done, as well as "Bullworth," "Bob Roberts," and the Citizen Kane of all political satires, "Network."$LABEL$0,0,-100

This is an amazing group with a great new jazz/classical sound. If you are looking for post be-bop and post Bird jazz listen to this group. I heard them live with Lee Konitz a few years ago at the Kennedy Center and they knocked me out - along with the rest of the audience. They have somehow managed to inject classical into jazz in a way that no one else has - maintaining the soulfulness and intimacy of jazz but bringing into jazz some of the beauty of classical structure. You can't dance to their music but you can revel in its originality and beauty. It registers pretty far forward on the frontal lobes. All the musicians in this group are accomplished but listen especially to the minimalist playing style of Florian Weber on piano. I'd like to hear more of this group.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The ending is an insult to humanity and good taste. FOR SHAME!!!!!!!. Music is great-my favourite modern cycle. Now what in gods name does the end mean. And more than that-it distracts from one of the most glorious musical segments in history with an absurd and meaningless concept that really has no bearing on the rest of the opera(s). It really breaks all rules of good taste and shamefully disctracts the listener and viewer from what they should be feeling as Wagner concludes this epic. I am flabbergasted and appalled that such a crock of sh****T was allowed to ruin this otherwise wonderful production. I recommend the Die Walkure as the best part of this set.The End--a group of people wheel out televisions and sip martinis while a blond boy and girl decide to hold hands.(In this ring--all walsungs have red hair so dont go there) It is even worse than what I have described because I am too upset to go on.

great value. I have tried different kinds of diapers for my baby and these regular Huggies diapers have been the best value for the money of all the diapers out there especially in the bulk cartons. They arrive quickly and shipping is free and it's nice not having to worry about running out of diapers for a while. Other brands do not have the amount of elastic to make them fit snug around baby's bum. The Supreme's do fit much better, but are not as cost effective. The Pampers do keep baby drier, but do not have the elastic to fit snug and therefore leak more than these. These diapers are used day in and day out here and baby rarely has diaper rash.

Pure Guitar Pop Gem. CONTEXT: In the middle of the early '90s grunge era, Sweet created 2 of the best pop rock albums of the decade. The production is a bit too squeaky-clean, but the songs are undeniable: they hook you in, and then keep getting better with repeated listens.MUSIC: A surprisingly diverse collection of blues riffs, jangle-pop, psychedelica, and even country sounds. The vocal harmonies are a throwback to the 1960s, but the music never sounds dated or derivative.LYRICS: Beneath the soothing facade are lyrics that express betrayal, heartbreak, and desperation. It's done so subtly that it sometimes gets overlooked.HIGHLIGHTS: I've Been Waiting, Girlfriend, Winona$LABEL$1,0,-100
An engaging memoir. Elva Trevino Hart has managed an impressive feat with this book. She recounts the depravations of her childhood without making you pity her. She also recounts the small joys she had growing up without giving the impression that these somehow made up for her poverty.It is rare to read a memoir where the author seems like such a real person. Hart's description of her family and history manages to be simultaneously matter-of-fact and deeply personal and emotional.

diappointed. Disappointing movie so I don't know why it won many accolades at the Golden Globes. Russell Crowe is a brilliant actor and his portrayal of a real schizophrenic mathematic genius was good. But Crowe's own seemingly charismatic, virile, and magnetic personality take away some believability. Jennifer Connelley gives a fine performance. Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer play minor characters but nevertheless are pleasure to watch. The guy who plays Nash's roommate "Charles" is entertaining as he did in the "Knights Tale". So I wonder why did this movie fell short of entertaining me? Maybe it took too long to tell a good story.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A warm pulse for background listening. Neither dubby nor dance-oriented, this release by Dale Lawrence rests comfortably in-between, making for engaging home stereo techno. Theorem knows his production technique, too- this album has clean, rich, and fully developed sounds, a pleasant break from the rougher bedroom programming often heard on solo works.There's the swirling echo of "Debris," the soothing, elongated synth notes of "Embed," countered by a bubbling bassline and popping drums, and the traffic noise with airy beat of "Shift," all enjoyable. "Cinder" and "Fallout" are solid, "Igneous" goes as close to dance sensibility as this album dares, with actual high tones, even. Only "Emerge," the sound of warped bubbles rising to the surface, is a let down.A warm pulse for background listening, an engaging release that doesn't require headphones or a PhD in techno history to appreciate. One of the better techno releases for 1999. B+$LABEL$1,0,-100

This product stinks! (literally). I decided to try this product because it has a higher DHA & EPA than the other prenatal vitamin I was taking. My doctor said that Omega 3's are the most important since we get so many of the other Omegas in our daily diets. This vitamin seemed like a good choice! Although, I did read some of the other reviews before purchasing and there were others that complained about the same issue.These fish oils reek! I have been taking fish oils for years and have tried many different brands, but these absolutely stink!To my knowledge fish oil supplements should not smell.

More Tedium From Peter Hopkirk. "Reads like a novel" ??? Come on, folks! The yellow pages of any phone book are far more exciting. This text takes a subject of great potential, & reduces it to the dried up dust of a Central Asian desert. I am disgusted with Mr. Hopkirk, because I truely love real History. This author is only one of the sorry crowd who destroy interest in even the most eager seeker. Our schools are full of them.

How did this book manage to get in print!. If I could rate this below one star I would. This book covered every stereotype possible: the boozy, trashy, red-headed Irish twins; the big, homely, muscular, Swede; the racist, phony, southern belle; the filthy, rotted-tooth little Frenchman, etc. Of course, the heroine is "chosen" by the most well-respected and good looking brave. The author made sure there was a mate for every one of his characters, there even "happened" to be one Black brave to be paired with the regal, non-conformist, former slave woman.The premise to this novel is original but everything else was so cliche' it was embarrassing.The only part of the book the author seemed to put any effort into were the elaborate, porn-like, sex encounters. I'm no prude but these scenes were thrown in helter-skelter and added nothing to the story line what-so-ever.Don't waste your money or your time on this book.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Karma ~ Delerium. With this recording the transformation of Delerium was complete. Gone was the heavy sound that was prevelent on recordings such as Stone Tower and in was the easier listening sound of Poem, Chimera and the like. Karma also had the international smash hit silence and I think that it is natural progresion on the part of Delerium. There are so many good tracks on this album and Leeb and Fulber have recorded and produced a true master piece. The book-let is very nice with an amazing cover that fits the mood and style of the album and the vocalists picked to sing the songs are all very accomplished with Sarah McLachlan leading the way with their break through hit Silence.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A bit of old, and a bit of new. But regardless, Bond is back. This book is a good read. Any fan of James Bond will enjoy Raymond Benson's classic take on 007. He merges the best of Ian Fleming's style, with a bit of John Gardner's plotting, and adding his own take, he creates a good read which is much better both plot-wise and character wise than compared to the last few clunkers from Garnder. Plotting is fairly good, with a few twists and turns along the way. All in all a very good first effort from Benson$LABEL$1,0,-100

Avoid this book beginner. As an experienced C programmer, I was very disappointed in the lack of attention to detail that the programming examples display. The amount of errors are abundant (out of bounds indexes, case sensitivity, spelling, etc) and MANY of the examples will not compile as written in the book. This book was used in an introductory C# class and I've spent more time debugging the books errors then I could have produced as a complete programming novice. I would pursue an alternative guide to programming in C# if your thinking of purchasing this book, it was definitely rushed for publication with little to no proofreading or editing in my opinion.

Don't do it! It's still in beta.... Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it "automatically" loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true...$LABEL$0,0,-100

Movie was a disappointment. I bought an old 2004 used copy of the movie because I love Sophia Myles acting. Based on the director comments comparing it to The Others and Sixth Sense, I was expecting a ghostie or two, but there wasn't even one. I guess the caretaker standing in the yard saying he didn't go to THE WOODS relates to the gardener in The Others, also the little girl saying her stepmother was MAD. Couldn't find anything that reminded me of The Sixth Sense. Too slow moving, too contrived, a lot of the plot didn't really make sense (she had so many opportunities to leave and didn't), none of the acting rang true like you expect in a movie, and of course the ending stinks. I'll donate it to the local library instead of saving it to watch again.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Bad bad bad ....

Andrew's Review. I gave the book one star because the book was really boring. It almost put me to sleep. The book takes place in Southern Illinois and it's about a boy named Jethro who wants to go to war during the Civil War. The Jethro's family got tired of hearing about the war and people on horses threatened them. There was very little bloodshed about the war and it got really boring as you got farther into the book. I think it was the worst book I have ever read. There was nothing I liked or great about the book. There was no point and that's why I gave it one star.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great Coffee. I like this coffee maker a lot! I spent a great deal of time searching the reviews and a variety of machines. While I have only used this one machine, I can say I made the right choice!

About 1 minute of humor. As hinted in the description and some other reviews, this book is really just about 100 jokes: 1 line questions followed by 1 line answers. To be sold as a book, I had really expected it to have some additional explanation or insight to expand the thought, although the jokes are really easy enough to figure that out on our own. The time to read it is about as fast as you can turn the pages.Granted, some of the jokes are amusing. This book is best used as a gag gift for someone retiring.

The author is about 20 years out of date as far as research goes and sticks to the AMA party line like glue. There are several completely unsubstantiated claims, such as page 51 "Combined with exercise, calorie intake that matches energy nees and not smoking the G.I. will help you live a long and healthy life". Really? How much longer? The actual GI chart contains a symbol meant to represent food that is "bad" for the heart. I was in agreement through the cakes and cookies but when it appeared in the meat and dairy I knew the author had either not done her homework or did it with a completely closed mind.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Discontinued. This AT440ML cartridge has been discontinued and is no longer available. The replacement is AT440MLa. If you order this item you will be getting he 440MLa which has a frequency response of 20Hz-20KHz, and not the 5Hz-32KHz advertised. The seller (Electronics Expo) does not tell you this or respond when they are emailed. Be Aware.$LABEL$0,0,-100
ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS!!!. Nothing but disappointment...1. You can't take stem with blades off - you have to clean it right on the mixer.2. Blades are flat - I can't imagine flat blade to be able to aerate something.2. Very unpowerful - it was fighting soft ice cream and blueberries for 10 min. and still I had pieces in my cocktail.3. After all my cocktail looked like milk with floating blueberries in it, not frothy whatsoever.My KitchenAid food processor did a much better job on these cocktails. I will probably get just a blender for this purpose.$LABEL$0,0,-100
I'm not buying this FOUR times. Three times is enough.. So like many i already bought BOTH versions of LOTR because the studio did this with DVD. I won't let them do it to me again, and neither should you. Please write your own one-star review as well.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Only the Grinch would not love this movie!!. The best Christmas tale ever - evident by Ted Turner running it for 24 hours straight the last two Christmases.But don't let that stop you. To see the real story of the Christmas story you need to see this on DVD and all its Red Rider Beebee gun glory.The cast is superb, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood. It is fond remembrances, without the overly cutsie pie touches. The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.I love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book. To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other. Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.Every family should have this.$LABEL$1,0,-100
completly useless!. i'm sorry to say that neither of my two cats have given this product more than a cursory once over since we got it around 10 days ago, nevemind use it for its intended purpose. they are both horizontal scratchers. basically, if its on the floor, its fair game. but not this thing! i tried placing it in their favorate scratching places, rubbed it with regular catnip + even tried Catit Liquid Catnip (see my review for that!) once, my older cat laid down on it + fell asleep like it was a floor level window sill but no action whatsoever since that thrilling performance. what a waste of money!$LABEL$0,0,-100

L&O - I just can't wait. Donate your gently used L&O DVD sets to your public library and get a receipt. This turns into a tax deduction (see IRS pubs 526 and 561) if you itemize or a great feeling if you don't.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The Greatest Live Album Ever!!. This is the loudest, rawest, most savage kick a$$ rock and roll record ever recorded! It never gets the respect it deserves. The only other live album that comes even close is Live at Leeds or maybe No Sleep Till Hammersmith. Before morphing into a radio friendly pop band (The Locomotion), Funk were the heaviest thing going. Nobody could touch them...Zep, Purple, nope. What's really cool is Mel's bass is high in the mix ala Entwistle and it really drives the band. And Mark has a guitar sound like no other mainly due to the Messenger axe going into the West amps. This generation needs to hear this album if they think Green Day is heavy!! Absolutely Essential. My favorite album of all time.$LABEL$1,0,-100

i waste my money. because I thought it would be much better. It was disappointing, really. I don't understand the good reviews here. 5 o 6 tracks are good enough, including La bamba y Come on Let's go, plus some traditional Mexican tunes, as Carabina 30 30 and Volver, but all the rest is far from been interesting, they bore and ask for skip. My impression is that they could be much more than they really achieve. They've got something (that something that made me buy the album) but they fail and never get to a great thing. I guess the fans will enjoy this collection, but casual listeners: be aware. Prometen más de lo que cumplen$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great if you don't want to pay for Bose. I've had these for over 5 years and have never had a problem with them. I use them on a daily basis at work to drown out loud co-workers, and also when flying. They don't drown out 100% of background noise, but I can't complain considering the price. Only issue is that the little rubber ear bud covers tend to come off easily and if you happen to lose one and don't have an extra with you, then there's really no fix.$LABEL$1,0,-100
This information is very dated.. Except for the cryptography section, this book was of no use to me. At school, this is the required class text but our professor told us to forget about it and go buy Hacking Exposed.

Everything seems to be missing.. I purchased this power pack for my HP Camera. The first thing I noticed was the lack of instructions in the box. There was NO paperwork included with the product. It also contained to adapter fittings, niether of which listed my camera on thier description - althoug, according to the ... Page, and the Unity Digital page, this is the exact model to use with my camera. (I did try it out after assumiing the battery would need to be charged for 12 hours like most, and tried the fitting that fit the camera. It worked right the first time, and since then it has not been able to take a picture - reads dead battery on the camera.... perhaps if I had instructions on how long to charge it.....) Overall, neat idea. I WILL try another one, but frankly, I was sadly disappointed with what I got.$LABEL$0,0,-100
EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENTS AND SONGS- good singing!. Superb songs. Linda's singing is good and very emotional enough but it is obvious that she is new to this material. She does not have the interpretive skills of Streisand, Fitzgerald or Holliday.Nelson sounds as good as ever and there is no question that even Frank's ghost is evident in these recordings.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not Accurate. I was very disappointed in the movie and stopped watching it midway. This is not an accurate account of St. Rita's life, I would recommend reading on her.At one point in the movie, I thought it was going to get trashy because on her wedding night, there was lots of kissing, sensuality, and then finally they walk off in the other part of the bedroom. This could have been left out of the movie, it did not need to show this, or all the times Paolo has to take his shirt off, and they could have left out the word [...]. This is suppose to be a movie on a saints life.It's already hard finding good family and catholic movies to watch but I'm not going to let me child watch False information that proclaims to be TRUTH. This includes other religious movies.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Good stuff to have on hand. This material will protect and preserve your documents and photos well. Also available in sheet size for general use, this roll is more versatile.

This one deserves a minus rating.. I have read all of Kellerman's Peter Decker books and have enjoyed most of them enormously. When I saw this one at the library I immediately checked it out. After plowing through half of it, trying to keep the characters straight and finding them so unpleasant I decided to come and read the reviews and wish I had done so earlier. Thank you to those reviewers who recommend utilizing my reading time on something that would be more enjoyable. I shall not be finishing this book. It will be back in the book drop this P.M. And yes, I agree that Amazon should have a zero stars rating, this one deserves it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

defective heating element. Some of the reviews on this product are several years old, which may explain why there is so much difference in the ratings of buyers. We have had various waffle makers for 40 years, the last a toastmaster, for about 20 years. Since toastmaster was bought by B&D we thought the quality of a new B&D might be a good choice. Wrong. It has very light plates and the bottom element did not heat evenly. The back half of the bottom waffle was raw dough on three attempts we made to make waffles. I am returning the product and would not purchase another B&D item.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Pricey, but if you are looking to learn calculus, this is A+. After taking differential calculus, integral calculus, and elementary differential equations, I took a year off of college. Then when I came back, I had forgotten alot of things concerning those courses. Well, I bought this book because it had the most pages and seemed to cover the most information. Well, it was a good buy! It covered ALL of the material that I had covered in those 3 previous courses. It was a great book for refreshing my memory. This would also be a great book for learning calc for the first time also.$LABEL$1,0,-100
