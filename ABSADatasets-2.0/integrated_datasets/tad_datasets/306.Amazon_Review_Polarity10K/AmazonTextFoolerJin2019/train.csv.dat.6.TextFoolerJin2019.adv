grotesquely idiomatic faust from Russia. If you're not put off by Faust in Russian, this isn't a wicked performance.It might help explain why Faust was so popular a hundred years ago and nowstrikes us as a bit of a bore. Kozlovksy is one of the alright Fausts on discbut he is not as subtle as in some of his other performances. Shumskaya is alsonot as good as on her Traviata -- she seemed to develop something of a slavicspinto after 1947 so she is edgier here and has no trill. Reizen is a goodmephistopheles but overacts. Still, it is a lively performance, well conductedby Nelboussine and even includes some of the ballet music.$LABEL$1,1,0

This cinematography is a bandwidth of horse you-know-what. A 10 year old could have done a better job directing. It's *sort* of about a horse, it's *sort* about an owner, it's *sort* about the comeback of trainer, but only skims all of them while indulging us in none. You can't blame the cast - these beings are satisfactory, yet completely reconnected while on screen. Malkovich is flowed through it as if he's got something better to do (he probably did!) and Ozzy Ozborn would have been more convincing as the owner than Diane Lane. A complete disservice dealt to the greatest racehorse that ever lived. Watch Seabiscuit instead. That was excellent and everything this should have been.$LABEL$0,1,1

Good quality but needy performance. The quality of the unit is done well, but the performance was much meanest than I anticipated. The monitor operates on the 900 MHZ band, which is used by many devices. The camera was on the second story of our house, and the video monitor was in our bedroom on the first floor about 45 feet away. We also have wireless LAN and wireless phones (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz). Regardless of how much I adjusted antennas and channel settings, the picture and sound quality was very poor. The sound always had a large amount of interference even at very low volume levels. I would not recommend using this product unless the camera and monitor were very close together and other wireless interference was limited. There are higher frequency monitors, so I may try one of those next.The infrared picture worked well - you could see fairly well even though the room had almost no light.$LABEL$0,1,1

I felt it was to big for us and reestablished it. The second one was by greatland at nearby target store. Both quality was much inclement than the swissgear's.

I tried to bent them and manage to fit in. The screen mesh is lage compared to ordinary mesh of any tent. The roof material is same thing as a tarp and look like water proof which is good thing.

Hah, it's not very bestest.... me realised this game 2 years ago and found it to be quite disheartened. I was a massive poss of the first "Army Men" game that came out and that was definitely a very cool game. "Army Men: Air Attack" has arguably strongest graphics than the first game and the gameplay is often problematic.It was cool to play a game with helicopters and army men, but the game is so short that you'll be done in less than a day if you play it non-stop. Look, the bottom line is that this game is just too short, too easy and is clearly based for younger kiddies, so I guess for a 16 or 18 year old this game is just a piece of piss.So get it for your kids if you like, but there are many newer, longer and more stimulating games out there, even for young ones. I guess that if I were a kid I'd give the game 7/10, but since I'm older I give it 3 stars. Just look elsewhere if you're above the age of 10, trust me...$LABEL$0,1,1

Unwieldy for residential use. The woodpecker pro is a good device if you live in a rural area where screeching bird recordings won't bother the neighbors. If you use this in the city, be prepared to receive a noise citation from your local police department. And no, you can't turn it down low so it won't bother the neighbors and still have it be effective. City dwellers might as well put that same $200 towards hiring an exterminator or pest control pro. The majority of times it's a single woodpecker causing the damage, so it's not like you're going to need follow up visits by the pro.

Ani considerable use for someone who studied music. Looking for a book that might possibly give me a better insight into the aesthetic value of music, I bought this with high hopes. Having previously studied music, I was also hoping for a unique perspective and a broader education in classical music, but founded this book to have nothing more than a college level textbook. It is arranged nicely and has great appendix on creating a music library. But the author is often long winded, using musical terms that aren't clearly defined and over descriptive and opinionated explanations of composers and their works. This might be nice for someone who has a beginning interest in classical music, but not for someone who has a working knowledge of the field.$LABEL$0,1,1

Grandiose performance rendered mediocre by poor recording. This is a wonderful performance of Un Ballo, but, I tend not to watch it because the recording techniques were so poor. By that I mean that the lighting was always just a bit too low (making it difficult, at times, to appreciate the wonderful colonial costuming used for this American setting of the opera) and the sound recording levels are far lower than on another DVD of this opera I own (making it difficult, at times, to hear subtle passages). From an audio perspective, this DVD gives you no sense of presence. Everything's just a bit too murky.Though I prefer the look of the production of this Un Ballo to the Swedish setting and costuming in another Un Ballo DVD I own, I tend to watch the Swedish one just because it's so much easier to see and hear.Shame on the technicians.

This is such a disappointment to those who watched, worked on, and truly loved the shows. The real showcase of MMC were the other talented cast members, who were not featured.

And, it has some good shots of 'teer siblings and friends like Trace, Jamie Lynn, Laura Lynn and Rachael (if this is interesting to anyone).This DVD will flop, and it deserves to.

You get what you afford for. This listens like a great deal. For $10 bucks more than the apple dock (standalone) you get a dock with ac adapter, a 3.5 mm to 3 RCA cable, an S video cable, a travel charger for the ipod (separate from the dock power supply), a remote, and a dock connector to 3 RCA cable (not dock connector to 2 RCA audio as posted). Buying these components separately from quality manufacturers would cost over $100. The problem is that Cables to Go is not a quality manufacturer. The dock produced an audible hiss and reversed the audio signal, so that that the left speaker played what the right speaker was supposed to play and vice versa. Further, the remote was extremely shoddy, requiring multiple button presses and extremely accurate aiming even at a distance of 12 feet. I did not use any of the cables, but if they are anything like the dock I'd avoid them.$LABEL$0,1,1

Displaced Story. Lucy's story is a unconvincing one. Being faced with carcinoma at a young age is difficult. Being subjected to the treatments is difficult. Adding to that having your face changed in that manner and being able to work through it was a remarkable feat and took resistance.It is a textbook that helps put many things in our life in perspective in both what we think are manifestation and scenarios that are "too sizable" to treatment when on reflection they are well within being nothing more than a minor annoyance and how we relate to and judge others. It also shows how strong people can be.The descriptions of what she went through and had to endure are detailed and disturbing and at times extremely unsettling. It still winds up as ultimately being a postive book, albeit sad.$LABEL$1,1,0

Otis Sounds Like A Guest On His Own CD. I have almost all Otis Spann's CDs and this is my least preferential so heavily. When I buy an Otis Spann CD, I buy it because I wanna to hear amazing piano playing. Spectacularly, on this CD the piano is burried deep in the mix and covered by loud guitars, drums, etc. It's almost like Otis is a guest or backup on his own CD! In fact on many songs, other people are doing the vocals! I would say skip this CD.

I bought this camera for a trip to Egypt. The camera worked the day before my trip and the first day of my tour it stopped working. It would turn on and off, on and off and then say turn off and then back on. All it would do is repeat this over and over.

Two different albums, three different sighs. To me it seems So Much For the City was all about being in love, not only with the brilliance of the California Coast but with a woman as well. The music, harmonies and general vibe of the album reflect this. The mimic up album appearing to dig more into the underbelly of the band and quite possibly the heartbreak of losing the woman. This is just a thought, I really have no knowledge of the singers relationships but I see clues throughout Lets Bottle Bohemia which suggest heartbreak, while the first album seems to emobdy the fire on new love. I also think the second has more of an East Coast, North East in particular vibe. It's not as sunny as the first but still very unique and packs a fist full of soul.

A Sea of White Impatiens was smoother. I wanted to amore this livres because I really enjoyed paras Sea of White Impatiens. Having grown up in the same town as the Gallaghers, I enjoyed all the references to the people from "Roweneck". The main character (or the author's voice) came across as ignorant sometimes and I was getting tired of the arrogant tone. It took an interesting beginning and an intriging middle, but the ending fell flat. The wrap-up was a bit outlandish and conveniently neat, like a Hollywood movie. Perhaps, that is the author's intent.$LABEL$0,1,1

Just didn't presume it.... Okay, first off...me donner credit for the pertains and behalf, nice job, but the book itself, I just didn't expect the bandwagon about it...the plot was bland, if not pesky and preditable.

I give Nikki her props for trying and pushing it out there, but there were some scenes that were not believable and maybe just too over the top and c'mon...I just don't see the moms black mailing all these big time officials just to get Yarn's man out of jail...dude was doing like life or sumthin...and that whole happy ending thing for a drug dealer, finally being let free and reuniting with his girl...c'mon...the moms would have been dead and so on...but once again, I just don't see the hype in this book...$LABEL$0,1,1

Don't Go To The Cosmetic Counter At All - Instead Buy PAULA'S Product!!. The first thing that flew out of the book when I took it out of the Amazon box was Paula's advertisement for her unique product! I was completely shocked and thinks like a goofball! I understand that she may feel, with all her research, she is an expert on the field, and even understand how she could possibly come up with an ideal product....but for goodness sake be SUBTLE!She should at least let the reader discover Paula's product (alphabetically listed)slowly. I can even get past ALL the smiley faces her own product gets, but I definitely don't want an insert to fly out of the book when I first open it. This is completely in poor taste, and I don't feel she can be objective!Having said all this, she may have valid points, she may have done great research, she may have the best product, but I really don't care, as I feel like an ABSLOUTE sucker for spending $20 for buying her advertising gimmick.$LABEL$0,1,1

I've had to return two copies of the FRANKENSTEIN and three of DRACULA before I found acceptable copies.The films themselves are fine and look great, but when the disk freezes or simply refuses to play a film, we're talking significant problems.I also cringe at the advertising aspect of these films (does the director of Van Helsing have anything to tell us about FRANKENSTEIN? Does he even belong on the same disk as horror film historian, David Skal. Nope on both counts.To my mind, these films should be repackaged and customers offered a free upgrade.

Never good enough. They might sound bad to me because I am used to Audiophile headphones. But they don't sound terrible. Nice clean highs, but the bass is a little muddy.

I'm beginning to think that I will simply ask for a return and get a different printer by another manufacturer.$LABEL$0,1,1
Cleverest movie in years.. Is this supposed to be art? Because it has no other value, other than perhaps for the purpose of studying the effects of boredom on the human psyche. I kept expecting the main character to be a hero, instead he's just a loser. I can appreciate a movie without a hero (i.e. Being John Malkovich) but can't they at least make the loser character someone who does something...anything...interesting?Also, the other characters are really weak. The best potential characters, the grandma for example, are barely ever on screen.I thought this movie would be like Rushmore, and I couldn't have been more wrong.I will say one thing positive about it, though, there is a scene where Napolean goes to jump his bike on a ramp and instead just plows through it - a really funny gag, I have to admit...most of us have done something like that.In summary, might be worth it if you can rent it cheap and get a backup movie, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.$LABEL$0,1,1
A Major Discontent. Neil Finn is without doubt one of the best songwriters of this era. With Crowded House his tunes were mixed with ever more innovativness reaching a pinnacle with Together Alone, among the best albums of the last decade. Try Whistling This sadly shows that he needs a tight unit to breathe life and energy into his songs. There are quite two outstanding tracks on this release, the catchy summer tune She Will Have Her Way and the spooky Sinner. Most of the rest lacks the spark that Crowded House seemed to produce in their sleep. A few tracks are even hardly b-side material. Neil obviously needs a group of musicians around him, not session players, to highlight his own talents.$LABEL$0,1,1
Ok tips, though somewhat out of date.. This book has great training tips for puppies and dogs, lots of critical exercises to practice with you're dog. I would say though that some of the author's explanations of wild dogs/wolves is based on out-of-date information, and one can find many newer books & articles on wolf & dog hierarchy. I think some of the tips given also can easily be done wrong or poorly, so anyone who picks up this book should be sure to read through the whole thing and not just attempt to pick certain exercises to attempt without understanding Kilcommon's overall philosophy.$LABEL$1,1,0

must have for older kids. Bumble bee kids makes a series of 5 dvd's that are done very well, and geared for the 6month-2 year old. My 6 month old has watched some of them every day and never gets tired of them. I bought this aphabet video by bumble bee kids for him when he was 19 months, and the kids in the video do not speak clearly, and sometimes whisper the words. My son wondered me to turning it off by the time we were at the letter "H". They should use the little girl who does the singing in their body parts video.

Good-story wanna-be. Eliza Blake is a beautiful news anchorwoman who enters your home, and the homes of thousands just like you, every day. For some, this isn't enough. Eliza has multiple "stalkers" sending her sick messages in the mail and on her phone. She and her five year old daughter are being threatened and it must end, before someone ELSE dies.This became the makings of a really terrific storytelling. In my kwun, it just didn't say all it should have. The main character, Eliza, should have done everything in her power to protect herself and her daughter. She really didn't do squat. She simply stood back, making observations. The writing was very predictable and matter-of-fact; I felt no suspense or any other emotions, for that matter. The dialog was very dull and rigid, like the words were simply pulled from a dictionary. I yelled at the book a couple times. You'll need a little patience with this one.$LABEL$0,1,1
SOBS RECONNECTING ARTISTS!!!. For this album, My Chemical Romance just copies the melodies and song structures on bands such as the Styx and Queen.

The list compiler probably spent a full day or two on www.google.com to find, block, cut and paste this "book."The title is very deceptive!On the flip side though, $12.95 + S&H is not a bad price for a reminder that the world is filled with unscrupulous folks! From this perspective the book was well worth every penny!Perhaps the author could next compile a list of porn sites, call it a book and title it "How to Have a Loving Relationship."$LABEL$0,1,1
a jamil resigns from Radiohead. I will start off by saying that this solo album from radiohead frontman Thom Yorke will not have mass appeal . This album is almost entirely electronic , and minimalistic in it's approach . Sufficed to say , it is destined to alienate the casual listener . However , if you enjoy lush , ambient electro-soundscapes with emotive vocals ( and you are not a card carrying member of the A.D.D. generation ) then you may like this very intimate and personal album . Essentially , this is a stripped-down Radiohead . Thom Yorke seems to have a re-newed sense of purpose , he isn't just going through the motions like on previous -RH- albums . This is his most inspired work in years .$LABEL$1,1,0
Either even conclusion. I wear a size 13 or 14 depending on the bringer. That shoe stretcher wouldn't even touching the sides on my size 13 Rockports. They were a little tight, so I wanted to loosen them up.It was counterintuitive how far from "stretching" they were. I would guess there was at least a half inch of space in the shoes when the "stretchers" AND the little knobs were fully extended. Without the knobs it probably would have been an inch.

Ok book for our times.. This book could be seen by some as an allegory of modern conservative-Republicanism run amok. A CEO traffics in human cargo and destroys indigenous tribal cultures to provide cheap labor for his company and protect against corporate espionage. The haves (Salts, Teavees, Gloops, etc.) all grow wealthier, fatter and more demanding at the expense of the hardworking have-nots (the Buckets.) Overweight children, kids with ADHD and post-feminist loud-mouths are skewered, while the child who keeps his mouth shut and plays by the rules of corporate culture is the ultimate winner.$LABEL$1,1,0

Get ready to yawned.. That is a needy theaters pumping to 5 stars by lucid sock-puppetry. I routinely worm an Amazon CDS with 5 stars and over 100 reviews.

From Zero to Shockingly, Duality. When I first heard Ra's "From Zero" I was in awe. A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me.

They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct.

Dickensian. Dalrymple's polemic is importantly that the unsuited have made many foolish taking, and that the rest of us therefore gotta them nothing.From route some countrymen make bad choices; this is obvious.

What art of book would he have produced if he had works with white-collar criminals and indisposed at a celebrity rehabilitation heart?Dalrymple's brand of concern was parodied well by Charles Dickens in Hard Times: a wish that the poor would simply stop being poor.

Wiser, overrated, but you need to leen it!. The Dark Knight Returns is a Luthor story, to be sure: dark, edgy, full of gadgets, villains, and of course, Robin.There are interesting retold techniques, most mentionable is the use of a television newscast to tell much of the story. Cancerous, I thought.But.. this comic is overrated. Not that it's not a good story, and so presented in all the visuals, but it's not to par with all the critic's talk. The story being written in the eighties must be taken into account, so the plot twists and other references don't really hit today's audience.This is, however, a must-have addition to any serious graphic novel enthusiast, Batman fan, or aspiring artist. The reference value alone makes it worth the read, if not the buy.-The GlowWormP.S.

It seems like all these stipper stories are always the same.. This book is too invaluable for the content. The book covers why women strip in clubs, then it goes on through many chapters of explanations, but in the end it tells us that it's because they make good money and fast. The book goes on to explain a strippers percetion of her job, then it goes on to tell us that strippers go through greatlengths to justify what they do and how they blame society, x-relationships, family and others, but never themselves. The book goes through many interviews, all of which are very much common and related. A good girl strips to finance her education, to support her children after her man leaves her or to support a drug habit. Or the most common, but not admitted, just for the money. This good is well written, but the story about all these stippers are all the same in this book and on every television review or movie.

Ingersoll-Rand website doesn't game handout. After much research, and reading everyone's reviews, I purchased the IR 2130. I opted for the 2130 over the 2132 because based on information on Amazon and Ingersoll-Rand corporate website, it appeared the specs for two were very closely matched, and I couldn't justify spending the extra money. However, to my surprise, when I received the 2130 today and actually read the owner's manual, it states the recommended FWD torque range is 25 to 350 ft.lbs. However, the corporate website shows the FWD torque range is 50 to 500 ft.lbs. So what's the real value? And why such a huge difference between the website information, and the actual owner's manual?

At least they spelled "God" correctly. This finale also held me turning the pages properly to the very end. The book ties up most of the son of the story at the end in a sardonic convergence of a bunch of story lines. In fact, approaching the last pages, you begin to wonder how any of these can be corrects by the end. Most of them are, but, as pointed out by others, a couple of the story lines are left discontinued. Although I've enjoyed the series greatly, one thing kept jarring me all the way through: Why does every human in the known universe speak in British idioms like "bloody"? This definitely makes this an "alternate universe" story; it's not "bloody likely" in our universe!

They then refused to take it back at their expense, even though they had shipped a broken unit (The first era the dvd didn't cooperatives, the unit they shipped to me haya a shitty vcr). Their users serves citizenry have no authority to help you, and neither does their management. Repeated attempts to move up the ladder were ignored (i.e. being constantly told they weren't available, they never returned phone calls even after telling me they would, etc.). Beware of any Phillips product.$LABEL$0,1,1

The Header Fits Them Perfectly!. Ice Cube went solo & had a successful career. Even though some of his songs were pretty harsh language wise, Cube always told a story, painted a picture of a young misinformed Blackman from the ghetto. Cube gave you the negative but balanced it with the positive. Cube's counterparts NWA completely fell into the bottomless pit of ignorance & couldn't recover. NWA's so called "street knowledge" in reality was "street nonsense." Without Cube writing the lyrics, NWA relies on ignorant word play & the most worst display of misogyny I have ever heard. There is nothing landmark about this cd, NOTHING! If I could have given this trash a zero I would.

If you really like 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' chances are this disc will be a indignation. Listen to sound samples before buying! Compared to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' this DISKS was a tremendous going down. Gone are the collages of movie audio samples placed over dark soundscapes (although a few short 'filler' tracks reflect this style). 'Hope & Sorrow' focuses more on guest vocalist and rappers and most of the tracks aground to impress. This seems to be an attempt at more of a commercial 'dance' release than the well crafted Turntablism record that I was expecting. I 'hoped' this disc would be an excellent follow up to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' but all I felt was 'sorrow' upon my first listen. A disappointment.$LABEL$0,1,1

Melodic Are Tania. Ricci writes pretty hooky rock music and uses the same sort of clichéd lyrics that brought the Stones greatness, but Mick Jagger, he ain't. To put it another way, he can't sing. Indeed, his riffs are so principled and mixed so urgently back that it's possible to believe there is no singer (maybe this was the engineer's intention). It seems clear that without Mick there would be no Keith, on the other hand, if one listens to Jagger's solo efforts one could equally convinced that the opposite is true.

Fervently Hoped the Suite. This was the first book I have read by either Eric Flint or K.D. Wentworth and I must declare that I was piqued from the commencement. The concept seemed fresh to be, man meets alien conquerors and fails to defeat them. This got not conform to the normal style of military sci-fi that I read. There isn't a whole lot of proceeding, there is some and it is better penned. The real catch of the livres though is the characters. The Jao are an extremely well thought out race of aliens. They are different enough to not be human but similar enough that they are can be reasoned with to a degree. The aliens have their own culture/society that dosn't always mesh well with human culture/society. Aille, the storys main character, grows and learns from his time on Earth and the people that he associates with. I highly recommend this book to any sci-fi fan and I can't wait till the sequel is released.One more thing, the space battle in the sun's photosphere is super cool.$LABEL$1,1,0

Disturbingly least your blood pressure & cholesterol!. I eagerly read this livre, since my partner has had lupus for over 20 years. As we adopted the vegan diet suggested in the book, my blood pressure has dropped from 140/80 while on 2 medications, down to 110/70 while on NO MEDICATIONS. I have also dropped 24 pounds since April (07). I thought that giving up coffee and sugar (especially chocolate) would be nearly impossible, but now I find that it has virtually no appeal for me. I'd much rather be feeling good!Ms. Harrington's recipes are quick & painless. She also suggests a wonderful, affordable health center in CA that gave us a "jump-start" on the vegan lifestyle.

She overlooks to see that the true purpose of education is not to tell people what to think, but HOW to think.

It's very important for our kids to know HOW to think because that truly holds substance. Telling them WHAT to think , like how Berit Kjos outlines, means nothing. It's a terrible example of the closed-mindedness in our culture today.It's also poorly written as well. It's nothing more than an bunch of personal inferences.

Loli....I just can't find enough of his stuff! 1980 COULD!. I totally dig this track, but it gets pretty tired if you listen to it all the time. I'm not wack about the two remixes in this imported (probably cuz I'm so fond of the frst album versions). However, his DUET with Elisa Fiorillo in "Right Dies Backward On It" cobbles! Myself all felt that he should ha recessed this in his album "Spin". Catchy lyrics and fun to dance to! And finally, the acoustic version of "Insatiable" almost brought me to tears. His voice is so compelling and I admire the influence of Kate Bush's "This Woman's Work" sung towards the beginning and end.I received this CD through an Aussie mate and I was excited to hear that he released "Crush" in Australia.

interesting but sassy. There's interesting information here, about the role offshore tax havens play in our global economy; much of it is quite revealing, as we learn about the Cayman islands, and what corporations do in order to avoid paying taxes. The author gets pretentious, though (and nearly unreadable) when trying to put a philosophical spin on things... there is a long chapter on that which is simply indigestible, and the interpreting are tad required as to be comical. If you can overlook that, though (just skip those parts) you'll get some interesting tidbits of information about the way corporations operate.$LABEL$0,1,1
Oh, this isn't heavily good.. Conor Oberst's anthems and virtuosity just reaches meanest and hugest: while at least in the past he was able to write somewhat-interesting lyrics and originate up with creative arrangements (such as the "Every Day and Every Nocturne" EP), here he patronizes the continue of country music in a series of agonised, overwritten romance that constantly strive after universal relevance, but just future off as self-righteous. The album's best moment is probably the single "Lua", but even that one's pretty lame. "We might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain"?

Glitzy, but bummed for younger kids. The schedule requires a lot of fine motor skills. It's too nagging for my 3 yr old. For example, there is a coloring page ("color all the squares blue"). There are so many of the squares, and they're so tiny, that even I get a little frustrated trying to maneuver the mouse onto each one. In moreover, the begets is set up around a theme of "save the stars". Kids at the younger end of the age range, such as my daughter, would probably benefit more from a program that lets them "wander at will" a little more. (Try Disney Preschool.) Or, at least, a theme that's a little more laid back. (For example, Pooh Preschool, where the goal is to help everyone finish their work so they can make it to a party.) I also highly recommend JumpStart Preschool.My daughter is at the young end of the recommended age group, so maybe she will grow into it more.

But make no mistake, this violator knowthat exactly how to pen a novel that I anticipate what the next page will read.

Mystery solve. Ahead!. A sullen girl is imprisoned in France. A young nun in Brazil is tormented by mysterious abdominal pain. Father Joachim (Gerard Depardieu), the priest-surgeon assigned to the nun's case, is mystified by her ailment and fascinated when its cause cannot be determined. Perhaps he sees in the young woman's secretiveness a reflection of his own violent past? What is the connection between these cases and the mysterious words "screel deen" that the nun screams in her agonies?The filmmaker strings us along for the better part of an hour, as we tease out the mysterious connections. We are treated to mysterious voodoo rituals on the beach, a nosy journalist wannabe, an improbably love story and a mother with secrets of her own. There is so much deliberate confusion and unclear switched identities that by the end, I wasn't sure what happened and I cared even less.BTW: This film is rated R only for 1 shot of a nun binding her breasts during the opening credits.$LABEL$0,1,1

All the wrong reasons. What a fearsome Christmas livre! Everyone is predicated by all the wrong controversies and no one tampered. Everyone is hateful to the Kranks and they are hateful in return. They skip Christmas to save liquidity. They then have Christmas to help their femmes catch a husband. People on their street decorate grimly--not out of a sense of celebration but rather one of duty. When Krank breaks step they don't throw off the shackles, but urge him to get back in step. One of his neighbors calls the cops on him. Charitable people doing good works are seen as con men. The Boy Scout leader gouges him when he has to buy a tree at the last minute. He and his wife seem to be engaged in a war. I feel like I've been ripped off. Thanks John!

Don't cour this book by its cover. . .. I am not new to spellcrafting, but I was feeling the need to give my practice a little boost. I headed to the bookstore and waited for a book to come to me. This one sort of dropped into my hands and didn't want to iet. I was sort of mortified by the Harry Potter references and put off by the cheesy cover art. But unless I had "asked" for the entitled manuel to come to me, I took it home even though I would not have chosen it myself. Surprise! This is a great little handbook. It is simplified, but as someone already familiar with many magical techniques, I found the brevity refreshing. The techniques and perspective are solid and sound, but the BEST thing about this little book is that the spells can mostly be done using handy, everyday materials. Its a great little reference tool, compact but covering a wide range of magical subjects. Im glad I didn't judge this book by its cover.$LABEL$1,1,0

Chuckle. this would have been a much, much, much more movie without the twist ending. A mother and father want to punish the serial killer who tortured and killed their son. Honestly, who wouldn't sympathize with that? So Mom and Dad kidnap the killer while he is being transported to a prison and lock him up in a empty cabin's basement and torture him.This is not easy for them, as they are not evil like the serial killer is, the mother especially has a hard time sometimes. Makes sense. Realistically done. Super.However, the twist ending blew everything out of the water. Now, there is not necessarily anything wrong with twist endings, as long as they are delivered and executed well and enhance the plot. In this case, it did NOT happen. It only ruined the movie and completely cheapened the story.$LABEL$0,1,1

Either selling out for Charlie.. You read reviews saying Charlie sold out with this release; I beg to differ. Mainstream radio wouldn't play this if their life depended on it! While he explores a couple of different avenues on two songs, this is much from selling out. You rarely hear the kind of rough and rumble, kick-ass style of country twang displayed here anymore. Some folks keep comparing this to his previous disc, and that's too bad for them, cause I can't see what the problem is here. Fickleness keeps some people from enjoying damn fine music.

Music to temper out to. I'm however a high school demanded, accordingly I received loads of homework to do all night. The thing is, I truely like to listener to music while I work, but most melodies completely distracts me. That's why I love U2's TOUS WHOM YOU CAN'T ALLOW SUBSEQUENTLY. I can listen to it and just relaxing out and concentrate on what I need to. The melodies are soothing and placate, but they also have some alright, mesmorizing melodies. My favorite tracks are BEAUTIFUL DAY, STUCK IN A MOMENT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF, ELEVATION, and WALK ON. I would recommend this CD to everybody. Just a note though, U2 isn't the kind of band that you really sing along to or anything, their songs are to be listened to and enjoyed, not vocalized by the listeners :-) Enjoy!$LABEL$1,1,0
It's a "copulation" No a Bible. I've had this book in my life for well over 10 years. When I first began studying Buddhism and the idea of Zen I was introduced to the Little Zen Companion. This book is a stepping stone. An introduction to bigger things. It's not a biblical and it's not a guide to living. It's simply a tool to help beginners grasp certain concepts while at the same time reminding Masters that sometimes the mountain really is just a mountain.$LABEL$1,1,0

Finally Just Disheartening. This sounds like it could be really cold, in a David Lynch sort of way..., but strangely, after a couple of listens it becomes very unnerving.

Set your goals? Here all you suffice to know is achieve them....... If you've set all your goals, and need to figure out how to achieve them, this is the book for you. Wholly of sensible, practical advice and procedures for drafting (and sticking to) plans, it overstepped every other libretto on goal acheivement that I've read.

Wouldn't praises for trimming the nether regions.... I didn't buy this for my beard, I bought this for shaving below the waist. True epic.What I don't like about this is that it is a trimmer but is sized like a pair of clippers. Normally, trimmer blades are about half the size of clipper blades. The blades on this are way too ample to do intricate trimming, beard or otherwise.This just doesn't fit comfortably in my hands, it is just way too thick and I can't comfortably trim with it.They need to market this as actual hair clippers instead of a trimmer. It's just too thick and bulky to be a trimmer.$LABEL$0,1,1

Ornish enjoy the replies to better physicians. Like Dr. John Mcdougall, Dean Ornish emphasizes that the diet, we as humans have eaten for millions of years in the key to good health. We have only eaten a high fat, high protien diet for the last 100 years. These food were limited to the wealthy and they paid the price with things like, breast, postate, colon cancers. These diseases are unknown in those cultures that follow all low fat, low protien, dairy free diet. He proves that most all cronic illnesses are related to the rich American Diet.

See "Saw". Sociopath movies mainly aren't my baggage but this imagery came recommended to me by a few implausible sources so I checked it out. When the film started out it was suspenseful but the inevitable comparisons to "Seven" started to float through my mind. About the half items the filmmakers kicked into second gear and surrendered some twists that are superior to "Vil". Outside of an above average script for this category class there is noteworthy direction by Jack Wan. Wan awfully has a sense for establishing mood and paces his film well. About the only really qualm I have with the film is that the characters aren't really fully developed. For those who are a little squeamish, the film does contain some intense and grisly scenes but on the whole it doesn't go over the top.$LABEL$1,1,0

Advisable for the $$$. Hey, they're 50 bucks. What do you expect for that price? For this price, they provide decent sound, play loud enough for most environments, have good bass response, and decent highs. It's hard to criticize for the price.

Alike since the 1980s Willeford has developed a sense of kidding which copulation his ability to crank out good crime stories, complete with memorable ascribe. 'Sideswipe' carries on in this tradition.In 'Sideswipe' with have a violent ex-con, a disfigured ex-stripper, a retiree who just lost his wife, and a talentless artist caught up in some shenanigans. Solving the caper is Hoke Moseley, our quirky cop from the novel 'Miami Blues'. Actually most of 'Sideswipe' concentrates on Hoke and his odd family whereas the crime story itself is a relatively minor element to the book. But overall it works well. The overall effect is funny without being stupid.Bottom line: competent and fun.$LABEL$1,1,0

Mostly good, but pauses easily if falling. I'm on my third one of these and longing not being shopping it again.The problem is with the design, peculiarly, that it breaks easily if diminished.The small loop attached to the main plastique spinal is very fragile at the attachment point (which is very small) and, since it's part of the mold, cannot change. (it's like an "O" that attaches at the bottom, rather than an upside down "U" shape, as other brands have).It's also made of a more brittle hard plastic, rather than a more forgiving soft plastic, meaning that it tends to break rather than give under pressure.If you accidentally accidentally drop your leash with this thing attached (even a short distance from your hand to the ground), you'll probably cause the ring to snap off, rendering it useless.This happened to me twice already.Otherwise, it's not a bad product and works well, but until they address the issue with attachment ring design, I can't give it a full endorsement.$LABEL$0,1,1
