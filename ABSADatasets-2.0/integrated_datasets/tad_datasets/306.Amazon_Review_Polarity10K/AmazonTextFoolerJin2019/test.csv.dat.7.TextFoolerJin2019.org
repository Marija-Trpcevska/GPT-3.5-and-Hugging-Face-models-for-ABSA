Wonderful Look at Gay Life in the British Fifties. Neil Bartlett's The House on Brooke Street is a wonderfully written look at the repressive 1950's in Britain. It has the erotic charge and the creepy paranoid (with good reason) fear mixed in equal measures to make this novel feel vivid and authentic. The unnamed lead chararcter takes the reader through his encounters and furtive loves through the decades to when he writes it all down in 1956 in a very compulsive manner that is sad and lonely with the thin shadows of anger, rebellion and triumph creeping in on the edges. It is an evocative look at a time but also a look at a time about to change. A very knowing, readable novel.$LABEL$1,0,-100

One star. Great pictures (for black and white), including of the tombs of some of the great Chinese Muslim saints; but regarding content the author displays very little interest/appreciation for the religion of Islam; he presents a book that is quite "fuzzy around the edges," with very little regard for the vast wealth of Islamic/Sufi tradition in China, including the Naqshbandiyya (Khuffiyya/Jahriyya) and Qadiriyya orders. One would wish to see in a book like this much more probing and intelligent representation of these truely fascinating people, the Hui Muslims.$LABEL$0,0,-100

How a uke should sound!!!. I have been a fan of the ukulele since growing up in Hawaii and hearing some really good players. IZ of course is a favorite with his ability to make a few clear notes have so much feeling. Troy in this CD captures some really great uke playing and has the ability to have a lot of flourish without going over the top(easy to do I guess). There is good feeling with some very complex playing. I would highly recommend this to someone new to the uke as well as those who have loved it for many years.$LABEL$1,0,-100
interesting. I thought the book, being short, was well done. I'm not a tolkien, the man, fan, myself, I just like the books he wrote. It was short enough to keep me interested and didn't go into tolkien worship. He was a man just like any of us. White didn't go into intense depth like some of the other authors, who border on tolkien worship. This book is for those who want to skim his life, his associations, like C.S. Lewis, his wife, etc., to see who he really is really quickly and go on. The few supposed 'errors' as some other reviewers put it, are completely outweighed by the many facts put forth by the author that paint the picture as it is done in other works, but at 30,000 feet. Like I said before if you want more depth and concise tolkien history go to some other book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

One of my all time favorite Jane Austen movies. "Persuasion" is a wonderful book and this is a fantastic movie version of the book. I had a VHS version of this for years and finally picked up the DVD.The cast is spot on - without "big" names to which the script is molded around. It is very true to the book - and evokes in the viewer a lingering wistfulness of what might have been.My recommendation is to read the book first and then see the movie to see the characters brought to life. If you are not a reader, you will still enjoy the beautiful story of a love that survives despite all odds against it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great glove for the price. Made with a tougher leather this gloves lasts WAY longer than other more expensive gloves. Sure the other gloves have that super soft leather, but with that comes accelerated wear and tear. Often times the expensive gloves develop minor tears after just one game. These gloves will last you most of the season. I found that I often lost my glove before it wore out. The only drawback is that the hand tends to sweat more in this glove, but if you remove it after every shot you won't have a problem.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not worth $60.00!. I saw all of the positive reviews for this body pillow and drooled over it for some time. It seemed like the best one on amazon. Boy, was I wrong! I'm pregnant and the first night I slept on it was horrible. I woke up with pains in my shoulders from the seams so I removed the cover that came with it as I had read about in other reviews. The next night, same thing. After a week of this I finally gave up. It takes up most of a queen sized bed and I found it didn't give me any support where I needed it. I'm 5'5 1/2'' and slender. No matter what position I was in the pillow was still very uncomfortable. I put it in my daughter's room. Seems the only thing in this house who liked it were the cats. Now it is just taking up space. I would recommend buying a body pillow without any seams in it because for me it just cut into my neck and shoulders all night long.$LABEL$0,0,-100
The weakest in an otherwise decent series. It seems to be the habit of most fantasy writers (or perhaps their publishers) to forever stick with the characters and worlds that made them famous; this pattern can be witnessed over and over again in the fantasy genre (see R.A. Salvatore, David Eddings, Robert Jordan, et al). The result, unfortunately, is usually books like this. One gets the feeling that even Brooks has grown tired of the series. The plot is nothing any faithful reader of Brooks isn't familiar with by now, and the literary execution is, to say the least, uninspired. Sadly, however, I'm sure that as I write this, Terry's publishing company is pressuring him to come up with yet another Shannarra novel, perhaps this time an epilogue to the series. What a waste of talent.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Works great, when it works. This is my 4th wireless mouse, and the only one that I've owned that is sufficiently smooth and accurate for gaming. Its also reasonably easy on the batteries. Ergonomically, its great. Just one problem, and its a big one. Sometimes it just stops working. Sometimes re-establishing the connection through the control panel will work, sometimes not. Sometimes reinstalling the drivers will work, sometimes not.

Trap. I read reviews on this trap and was excited to give it a try. I placed and set the trap as described, but was very disaapointed with the results. The gopher unbelievably was able to defeat the trap many times, packing the trap with dirt but not setting it off and being killed as descibed by the manufacturer. The spring on the trap is too week, and the trigger is of poor material/design. I'd stick to the "Vitor" brand black box, as it works good on gophers not experianced with trapping techniques. I finally decided to hook a metal dryer vent tube up to my cars exhaust pipe, ran the other end of the pipe down the hole, let the car idle for a while, and killed em dead.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not missing much. Buried Alive revolves around a group of college kids who soon learn that the demonic spirit of a woman murdered in their vacation house is out for blood, and guess who's in her axe-wielding sights? Robert Kurtzman, best known as partner to gore effects gurus Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger (hence, KNB Effects) and the original scripter for From Dusk Till Dawn, directs Buried Alive, and sadly it comes off as another derivative, uninspired slasher flick that provides little in the way of scares or suspense. The acting is atrocious and the story is cliche and oh so predictable (for the most part), but Buried Alive does have a few good moments of note, including some nifty gore effects and a small role from Saw's Tobin "Jigsaw" Bell, who himself up's the creep factor just by appearing on film. All in all, Buried Alive may be worth a look for die hard slasher fans, but those that don't see it won't be missing much at all either.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A Good Buy?. Don't bother with this book unless you want to read a novel worthy of a daytime soap opera. There's nothing but melodrama here.

I took it home and was doing the minor assembly and noted the machining of the fasteners was terrible and the nuts were loose on the studs/bolts they were fitted on. Packaging was just ok...........there was a loss of paint on the seat post from rubbing something. the tires inflation is rated for 45 to 60 lbs. I was pumping up the rear tire after doing the front tire and got to the 45 lbs ok.............then got a loud pop and the tire blew out very loud.

Good concept, poor content, lacks detail. The video covers what could be interesting and important joint locking and joint control techniques. But the videography is terrible. It looks like they had the video recorder on a tripod 10 meters away and filmed this in one or two sessions with NO closeups. Even though I am an experienced martial artist (17 years), and aficionado of joint techniques, I could not figure out the hand and finger positions the people used and described in the video. The subtitles had poor English so additional detail could not be gained there. From the distance the techniques were shot it looks like they have some interesting methods and techniques, but there is almost no way even experienced practitioners would be able to apply these without multiple trial and error sessions. I gave it 2 stars because there is potential there, but all and all it is a disappointment.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Far from a triumph.. Blackmantle is in my opinion a hugely disappointing effort from Kennealy-Morrison and is symptomatic of a slide that has occurred in the quality of the series since the Copper Crown ( a truly superb book ). I agree with the comments about it being a thinly disguised autobiographical novel and it got far too mystical in places -not enough essential action. I await the arrival of the Deer's Cry on this side of the Atlantic with a touch of foreboding- especially given some of the comments I've read on it$LABEL$0,0,-100
Dangerous nonsense. Such a shame. I saw the book advertised on TV and was intrigued. But within the first few chapters I began to question some of the logic. For example, from Chapter 2 "Consider this--animals in the wild such as chimpanzees do not get sick!" ... at which point I thought, erm, yes they do? Then, as I was asked to consider more and more "startling bits of data" that were clearly suspect I started to get really suspicious about about the author and the authenticity of what I was reading. So I Googled him. I suggest before buying this book you read his Wikipedia entry. That, and other references, have made me decide to throw this book in the recycling, and satisfy my interest in naturopathy from an author who's much more legitimate.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Would Not Recommend this Toy. My 2 year old son received this toy as a gift. Although he somewhat enjoys playing with it, I was seriously disappointed with the functionality of the click bricks.First, the click bricks don't 'stick' together well. If you pick up two joined sections or try to reposition them they fall apart -- very frustrating for a 2 year old!! I think the magnets are way too weak. Some of the magnets don't work at all!Second, you can't really build much of anything with the pieces in this set. They have some neat pictures of built projects on the box, but good luck recreating them!I would absolutely not recommend this toy.

tough to beat. I have to say I'm totally hooked on this show, I can't wait to get the next season on dvd! As a doctoral student in clinical psych I'd say it's probably the closest thing to real therapy that your going to see on tv or movies, it's the closest I've seen. Of course it's sped up to fit one client into one season, but it's pretty accurate in its depiction of how a psychdynamically-oriented clinician goes about work. The fact that he does his own personal therapy is a major plus for the show, it gives you a great view of the human side of the therapist that you don't see when he's the therapist. Overall, it's a great show. If you like this type of therapy (psychdynamically-oriented, non-manualized, etc.), or if you have had some of this type of therapy yourself, I'm sure you will really like In Treatment.$LABEL$1,0,-100

On my top 5 list of favorite movies. This movie was just simply amazing. If you are the type of person who easily feels other people's pain then you may need an entire tissue box after the movie is over. I felt everything the movie wanted me to feel. Guilt, remorse, sadness, and even happiness. I don't understand why people would totally dislike the movie just because of a few factual mistakes. There are thousands maybe even millions of movies that don't get the facts %100 right. I hate when people look for the negative in things and then forget all about the positive. If this movie didn't move you to want to at least consider donating you have no heart..regardless if the facts weren't all right. I cry every single time I watch this movie.

dark and depressing. I love Angela Hunt's books because they are all different. Unfortunately, I knew I was in trouble with this one when I read of Mark's favorite pastime. From there, things went from bad to worse. The book depressed me, possibly because it addresses the afterlife and I was just looking for a good inspirational read. I also had trouble understanding if Ms. Hunt was really trying to describe hell, purgatory, or was merely using poetic license to get readers to take stock of their relationship with God. If the latter is the case, she succeeded. However, I do think that any book that addresses such a dark issue needs to thoroughly counterbalance that darkness with the Hope we can have in Jesus Christ. Kudos to Angela Hunt for tackling all topics, but I will probably not recommend this book to any friends!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Well, if you are a true Beatle fan..... I have been a Beatles fan since 1964, and I have distinct memories of the band's influence on my young life. I saw Hard Day's Night, Help!, Yellow Submarine, and Let It Be in the theater when they were first released. This film has always been the Holy Grail of Beatle fandom.Now that I own it, I can honestly say I understand why it took so long to release it to the public. That thirty years of isolation, locked up in a vault somewhere in London, only improved its standing in my imagination, not on actual film. The BBC was right to bury this.

Don't buy this toy!. I bought this for my 9-year-old son on his birthday and it is totally useless.

Informed Decisions - 2nd edition. As an owner of the original "Informed Decisions" I was thrilled to see that there was an updated edition. I purchased the 1st edition when afamily member was diagnosed with cancer and it was a wonderful help -notto try to make decisions, but to know what to ask the doctors.I purchased the new edition in order to try to do the same for a familymember with oral cancer. What a disappointment!!! I expected to findupdated info about staging and survival rates, Not there!! Just a generaldiscussion that is not any more helpful than the information in ageneral use medical text, such as Merck's, Johns Hopkins, etc. If agood text is needed, find a used copy of the original "Informed Decisions" and check the data with your doctors.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I watched it 3 times in one day.. I notice how this movie didn't get rated with 5 stars. Maybe because Owen Wilson is always funny with ben stiller by his side. But I gotta say he pulled it off without B.Stiller. Not all can relate to this movie. I know I wish I had someone to fend off the bullies while I was in school. LOL!well, my fav part was when Owen ( Drillbit) told the kids to find a common ground with the bullies. So the fat kid had a free-style (rap) competition with the main bully. Except he only made the bullies more furious and embarassed them.there are other funny parts in the movie but this just made the movie..to me anyway.$LABEL$1,0,-100

An odd and enchanting writer from Denmark. Hoeg is known in the States for his mystery/exoticica Smilla's Sense of Snow, but when addressing his fantasy/real world body of work he falls into the rarified atmosphere of South American novelists who mix a crackling good story with elements of fancy. Yet Hoeg's fancies are dark and brooding and compellingly written. Bravo and more please.$LABEL$1,0,-100

let down. Willing to give it some more time but this record is a big let down. It's still Supergrass so there are lots of great vocals and band personality but the songs are largely insignifigant. Where is the weight?"Prophet 15" and "Run" are all that keeps me from smashing this thing over my head and into one hundred bits. Run is a top 15 Supergrass song but low on that list. Prophet 15 would have made a nice b-side surprise. Something is rotten here.I saw it coming when the last album was dominated by weak material but I did not want to believe that it could happen.The last album has some gems though that more than save it and seperated Supergrass as one of the true musical leaders of this pale generation.Why could this not have continued?Let down.

Useful for a beginner. I bought this book hoping to pick up a little bit of the language that so many of my friends speak.Although it is no substitute for personal instruction, I found this to be quite useful.

A perfect book for young Star Wars Fans. I think that this book is middling in complex wording, probly created for kids around the ages 8-12.

For older readers seeking Star Wars Books, try the Young Jedi Knights series, but this book is a perfect book for a younger reader.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Excellent protein supplement. My son recommended this for my recovery from heart surgery six months ago. My wife and I have been taking it ever since. I think NOW products are good across the board, and this one is particularly good. I'd recommend the "natural" flavor over the "Dutch Chocolate." The natural flavor doesn't require a much to constitute the same amount of protein, thus saving money, and the natural has a very neutral flavor. We use it in a smoothie every morning with lots of different nuts and Green Vibrance and a banana. Makes for a very filling breakfast. I think this product really helped in my recovery.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The Best Despite Others' Criticism. This book was one of the BEST I have read in a long time. It takes a fantasy sci-fi book to a new level. It was supenseful, intriguing, and a renewal of faith.

Worst album ever?. I would give this no stars if that option were available. The only interesting thing about this album is that it is mentioned by Thomas Pynchon in Gravity's Rainbow. Amateurish, pseudo-psychedelic pseudo-folk of the cheesiest, silliest, most inane and cloying sort. Do not listen to this album. It may be hazardous to your mental health, especially if you attempt it with trendy chemical amusment aid. No redeeming value on any level, even as an artifact of silly psychedelia.

Inaccurate Sizing. If you have a larger breed dog (GSDs, Labradors, Huskies, etc.), beware of the sizing.I decided to buy one of these muzzles for my 9 month old German Shepherd for when he goes to the Vet. The sizing information on the packaging and the website are all way off so I didn't really get to test it out. They both suggest a size 3 for GSDs, but in reality, the size 3 is half of what my dog would need. And my dog is standard size, so he's not over-sized or anything.I returned this and ordered a Size 4XL. Hopefully that will fit.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great price and functionality.. I was looking for a compact electric kettle that would be good for travel. The Proctor Silex K2070Y 1 Liter Electric Kettle was the best choice I could find, and the price was very attractive. It is a very useful and mostly well-designed unit. Lightweight, compact, easy to see the water level, easy to see the "on" light, and fast. Two and a half minutes to a boil (filled at the minimum level; enough for one large cup). The only down side is the on-off trigger sticks up and might break off during travel, and the pouring screen (inside the spout) is not very secure. It has come loose several times inside the pot. All-in-all, a very good product.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A delightful twist on an old favorite. My four year old daughter adores this book. Already a huge fan of the classic Cinderella story, she found this book at the library and enjoyed it so much I had to purchase a copy for our own collection. The illustrations are bright, colorful and clever. The story is long enough to hold the interest of a child who is ready to move beyond single-sentence storytelling, yet not so long that it takes forever to finish the book (always a plus if you have a child that is always trying to negotiate for just one more book before bedtime).$LABEL$1,0,-100
My cat love it!. Great Supplement!! I got both the one for dogs, and the one for cats. They all love this supplement very much!

Great guide but needs updating. This book is excellent for both the novice and experienced eBayer alike. Everyone who uses eBay regularly should be able to take something away from this book.As a previous reviewer has stated, some of the tips are common sense, and come straight off the ebay site. However, its great to have these tips in one place and easily referenced. This can serve as a checklist for your own buying and selling procedures.PS: Second edition has now been released. Make sure you are buying the new one.The one big negative - no coverage of the latest 'bid sniping software'. This automates your bidding, allows better planning, does not increase the sell value early in the auction and maximizes the chance of winning (by placing a bid in the last seconds of auction). This software isn't highly publicized by ebay.This is a great book, but look out for newer texts covering the latest auction software.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Good Knot Book. This book gives clearly illustrated instructions on tying many very useful knots. It organizes them under headings of Sailing, Hiking and Climbing in which they are most commonly used. The author includes the strength of most of these knots which describes how much they weaken the lines in which they are tied - often leaving less than 50% of the original strength of the line! Some knots do not hold well when bending (you will learn the definition of this term, as well as "hitch" and "knot") together two ropes of unequal size. Maybe you should use a different knot? Budworth has a suggestion!This book is both useful and interesting thanks to the inclusion of a brief history of each knot. It did not change my life, but it did change how I secure my anchors! I recommend it!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Look great, work great.. I've owned a similar set of these for 8 years that came from the dealer when I bought my car. They've been great and totally trouble free so I bought these for my old truck after recently purchasing new tires/wheels. These fit great on the longer studded 3/4 ton and 1 ton axles. Let's not kid each other - if a real thief wants your tires/wheels there are relatively easy ways for them to get any wheel lock off. For the modest price, however, why not try to at least deter the casual thief? These fit the bill, look great and come with a great warranty.Cheers!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Time Travel & Pseudo-Scientific Jargon. Time travel and what-have-beens are among my favorite type of book. Highly recommended are Anderson's TIME PATROL, Piper's LORD KALVAN or Dann's TIMESHARE series.However, Mr. Parkinson has produced a plot with a minimal storyline, characters with confusing pasts, presents and futures, a knowledge of history which would not do justice to a ten year old and glossed over this dross with mathematical constructs and scientific jargon in a mish-mash of nihilism. Having received the enire series plus his TIMECOP work, the best I would note is that Mr. Parkinson's writing is of a consistent level -- unfortunately, that level is poor.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Wonderful performance of Swan Lake. First thing is to say that indeed, today, you can find much better recording qualities (we are in the DDD era). However this performance by Boston and Ozawa is the only one that got the zing. It's really emotional and Ozawa truly lives Tchaikovsky's dream. As others have already noted, the string work is magnificent, and the listener might cry together with the swan... If you are a ballet fan, Buy this CD!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not Very Good!!. I was assigned to read "Define Normal" & if not for that, I wouldn't have finished it. I think the age level it was meant for doesn't match the age level that would actually enjoy it. I agree very much with the review that called it dry, it lacked emotion & any depth into the characters. I found it boring & corny. I just don't really think that the author really has much talent. It's not a book someone could really get into. The only positive thing about it is that it's easy & fast to read, only I think a 4 year old could read it. Nope, I would say, don't waste your time & money.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Fun, but does NOT contain words that you can use every day. I actually purchased the day calendar that was produced from this book by Jeffrey Kacirk. The information he provides about each word is fascinating and wonderful! However, this is a book full of words that are forgotten for a reason...they are no longer of much use to those living in our times! Some could be used, but most refer to things that are no longer in use, or to issues or items that we no longer have knowledge of. For instance, there are many words that refer to horses as a means of transportation--since we rarely use them in this manner, the words are not functional for our society.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history or etymology, but not to those who, like me, are looking for words to add to their current vocabulary. I enjoy the information, but that enjoyment is soured by my dissapointment in not finding words that I can actually use from day to day.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Uses 100% CPU, No Response from email Support. I've used Trend Micro for a couple of years as a happy user and upgraded recently. I installed 2007 on one of my 3 PC's. A Trend Micro program called PcnSrv... will eat between 90 to 100% of CPU. I have to kill the process in order to use the computer. Apparently this is a known problem but Trend Micro has no obvious information on their website about it. Via google I found some information about this problem with a suggestion to deactivate SpyBot. But that did not work. I sent 2 or 3 support emails, and they never respond. I am getting rid of this product and will not install it on my other 2 PC's. It is bad enough to have a problem like this but when the support staff will not respond, that is a deal killer. Very disappointed. I wasted my money.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Overheats in Microwave. I bought this set because it said it was "Microwave Safe". I don't know what this term means in respect to this set.

Crystal cracked. After about a month of ownership of this beautiful watch, I went into HyVee's beer refrigerator for 30 minutes. I was diligently choosing beers I was curious about. I then walked outside into a hot, humid day. I drove home. During the drive, I begun to hear a cracking sound. I wasn't sure where it was coming from, but it was near.After I arrived home, I looked at my watch to see the crystal was cracked right down the middle.

Fair Warning. Okay, okay, how do I say this nicely? This book is all but unreadable. Period. But not for the reason(s) you might think. The author is British. I am a not, and frankly, half the time while toiling through this book, I didn't have a clue as to what this writer was talking about. You see, that's because the book is written a la "British humor". British humor combined with late 20th century British slang terms, references, in-country gossip, yada, yada,yada. It's a book written by a Y2K Brit for fellow Y2K Brits. While his stories of previous Tour races are interesting and well written, so much of the rest of the book, like I said before, had me more than once thinking, "What is this guy talking about??"All you Anglophiles can turn up your noses if you wish, but I personally would not recommend this book.

I Beg to Differ. I thought BASIL was an intriguing film - a classical tale of revenge gone wrong. I couldn't figure out why it was rated R though, since there are no sex scenes, and less violence than what is found in most contemporary films.I didn't find it dull at all, so I guess I will be one of the few people who thoroughly enjoyed this film.

The Rippingtons ~ [Rippin'] Live Across America!. I have listened to many traditional and contemporary jazz artists, but none inspire me like The Rippingtons.I bought this after seeing it on the shelves and listening to music samples. All of the tracks are performed live, with 9 of them being remixes of some of their previously recorded work, 3 of them being remixes of well-known songs by other artists, and 2 being altogether new, never-been-heard before songs.And it is for the one song, "Road Warriors," that I bought this CD. The electric guitar, and just the whole arrangement of the song, is just so POWERFUL and MOVING. "Are We There Yet?" the second new song on the disc, simply sounds like a more mellow version of "Road Warriors," following the same melody.Sure, the other performances were good, but nothing special if you've already heard them before on their previous CDs; they're just done with that much better instrumentation this time around.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Biased Film ??. They have taken 3 stories and put the women in a worst case scenario. I felt like this film was really trying to push "Pro-Abortion" down my throat, and not very subtley. They are using high drama and emotions to try to influence those who question allowing abortions as a "convenience" for a woman. Very few women have abortions due to life threatening situations. In reality, most abortions are a matter of convenience. Period. Why not be honest about it ??? I wouldn't recommend this film, but if you are really pro-abortion, you would probably like it. This film is biased, but if you realize that up front, then it's okay.$LABEL$0,0,-100

While I had an issue with Goodman's on this initially, they made it right and I applaud their concern for their customers!$LABEL$0,0,-100

very peaceful and soothing. This album is useful for (1) focusing on work and (2) de-stressing from everyday anxieties. This album has been able to soothe me at key moments. I listened to the album on Magnatune and then had to purchase it because I enjoyed it so much. I would whole-heartedly recommend it. I think the first reviewer's idea to give this album as a gift is great.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Kinobe - Soundphiles. Kinobe's first album, SOUNDPHILES, finds them raiding the crates for all sorts of samples and influences, from the neo-spaghetti Western of "Hombre" to the voodoo funk of "Bayou Barrataria." Some mighty fine downtempo on display here, probably best exemplified by the sleazy listening classic, "Slip Into Something." It makes you feel sexy just listening to it. In some places, though, there's a bit too much reliance on samples to carry the track, such as "The Biological Break" or just plain outright silliness from a mediocre M.C., such as "Theatricks." But when they stick to smooth downtempo grooves, they're on fine ground: the lazy country vibes of "Bopalong" or the blissful "Lucidity" which suddenly kicks into house gear or the through-and-through calm of "Hammock Island." Slip into something comfortable and enjoy this album.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Buyer Beware. The sets shown in this video are not traditional Shaolin Kung Fu. Rather they are a poor mixture of Wu Shu (Chinese aerobics) and a common village art known as Long Fist. This style of Kung Fu is a creation of the Communist government of China and one designed to sucker money from naive Westerners.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great bags!. These bags are perfect for storing milk in the fridge or the freezer. Based on other reviews I was skeptical to buy them because of the leaking issue, but i've only had one bag leak on me ever and i've been exclusively breast feeding/pumping for 7 months now and have used these bags since the beginning. I registered for them because they held the most milk. The bags that I freeze, I usually only put 6-7 oz max in each one so they will lay flat. However I keep milk in these bags in the fridge also and will sometimes put up to 10 oz in each bag. You can fit 12 oz like someone said but then the bag is hard to zip and even harder to pour the milk out of without spilling so I just stick with 10 oz. I highly recommend them!! They also don't leak or anything while pouring milk into a bottle which is great!! This is something I keep buying over and over!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Works. I bought this product because I have sun spots on the upper parts of my cheekbones and forehead. I had heard that this product's ingredients are not as harsh as a lot of the skin lightening products on the market. I've been using this product for about a month (2 times a day when I remember) and it has helped lighten the sun damage considerably. I don't know if the sun spots will ever be completely gone. But I've started using dermablend foundation which has worked out well to help cover what still remains. I have very pale porcelean like skin and with the help of this and the dermablend my skin looks almost perfect.$LABEL$1,0,-100
if you're reading this, you should buy this album. solid musicianship, solid songwriting, a variety of styles, terrifc, compelling vocals. you even get a song from the viewpoint of a migrating whale and a song about slowing down on a fresno-area twisty road--what more do you want? if you need a frame of reference for the sake of comparison, they are more traditional than, say, the beachwood sparks. if you think you don't like "country music," you must be thinking about that swill nashville pumps out. this ain't that. check it out.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Worst company ever!!!!. I ordered Chocolate from Italy. Maybe this was the first mistake since it is Texas in the Summer. Anyway I took a chance because this is suppose to be the best chocolate in the world; according to another website. Anyway the chocolate arrived at my door when I was not there.So fedex in all its wisdom drove around with it all day and tried again when I was not there. I had to go to the fed ex office and pick it up.When I opened the box of course the chocolate was soup and the remains of a soggy single ice pack. What does this say about this company?They ship from Italy with one tiny ice pack; not even dry ice.Also they said it was my fault that I was not home when Fed ex tried to deliver the package. So I am out $75 and nothing to show for it.Please send a message to this company that their chocolate is not all it is cracked up to be.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Didn't notice a difference. I like Aussie products and they smell great tooWhen I got this in the mail, I was excited because I thought hey who doesn't like softer hair? and so cheap too!I used it for about 2 weeks and noticed that even though it smells like coconuts, it didn't do very much for my hair like I expectedInstead of soft and sleek as I was expecting, it was more like salt water hair lookI will still use it, if I want to appear like me and my hair have been to the beach but for shine and sofy and sleek I like the Dove hair serum they best$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not what we expected.... My son received this toy on his first birthday. He loves Winnie-the-Pooh, and although it seems to be a very durable toy, it is difficult to play with. The "wires" aren't spaced far enough apart to easily maneuver bees from one side to the other. That's basically all this toy consists of, other than having a nice "baby powder" smell. It just doesn't hold my son's interest for very long.$LABEL$0,0,-100
I fell in love with this sound.... I listened to this CD, and bought the rest of their titles. I never fall in love with any music on the first go... but I did here. They are the only band of which I have all the albums.I can't praise this band enough. Tight harmonies, accomplished music, thoughtful lyrics... Doug, Jerry, and Ty do it all. Get it, throw it in the player, let the music wash over you. Then, dig out the lyric sheet and play it again. There is many levels to some of the songs... what does "six broken soldiers" mean, anyway? mmmmm$LABEL$1,0,-100
SO uncomfortable and not safe!. We bought this a few months ago for our 1 year old daughter. I had an off brand carrier with my son and loved it, so I thought this would be even better. Wrong. My shoulders ache 5 minutes after putting it on. Even my husband, who is strong and has a high pain tolerance, can't wear it for longer than 30 minutes.Because my daughter's feet can reach the bottom of the frame, she tends to stand up and wiggle out of the straps. I hate that I'm constantly having to tell her to sit down. I listed it on Craigslist and I'm going to purchase something different.$LABEL$0,0,-100

The "Citizen Kane" of Canadian Frat Movies. Just like my title said, this movie is the "Citizen Kane" of Canadian Frat Movies.

The most boring movie ever made. I never thought I could be so bored watching two naked ladies, but I was. I couldn't even make it half way through before I removed the DVD and threw it into the garbage. This is just a chick-flick for lesbians, because no guys could possibly be interested in the endless dialogue about nothing. These girls just drone on and on about nothing in particular, most of which is just them telling lies. I guess the fact that they are naked for 99% of the time is supposed to keep you tuned in. But like they said on Seinfeld: "There's good naked, and there's bad naked." Well, let me tell you, this was "bad naked." No stars for you! (Yes, I know, it shows that I gave it one star. But this is because Amazon forced me to.)$LABEL$0,0,-100
You get what you pay for. I knew this was a cheap flask and went into the purchase with open eyes but, you get what you pay for!Plus:+Good size - I like the capacity, curve and general dimensions+Sturdy - nice gauge steel+PriceNegative:-It leaks - the stopper in the cap is made out of some sort of hard plastic or vinyl that doesn't seal. Needless to say, bourbon leaking into your pocket is not a good feature.I'll try to find something that I can replace the seal with and get it to do the one job its made for. If I can get it to not leak I would give this product four stars but it loses two because I have to hack it to get it to work.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Very cheaply made. I would not recommend this.. This item looks great in the photo, but when it arrived it was so badly made that I sent it back immediately. The bottom plastic part that is supposed to screw into the glass wouldn't sit properly or screw in correctly, so the metal part of the bottom also sat crookedly.The "copper" outside parts were cheap as well and looked like they would discolor immediately out in the elements. I would not recommend this item to anyone.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Infamous Aircaraft. The book is misnamed. There were very little about "Dangerous designs and their vices" and I was disappointed with it.

Best Tortilla Warmer. This warms the tortillas really well and then keeps the tortillas warm for quite awhile. Looks good on the table too.

Looks very bright and good on the table too. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Xenosaga special edition dvd. The actual game is great, but its takes a long time to play through (approx 80 hours).

Good for the price. I bought this after borrowing a similar one from a friend. No, the sound is not perfect, and yes, sometimes you get some static from the radio stations, and sometimes you have to try to find another station. But I live in Washington, D.C. and often travel the I-95 corridor to New York, and I have never once not been able to use it at all. Sometimes it gets a bit fuzzy, as I said, but you can still hear your music. So, I would suggest it for anyone who is just looking for an affordable way to listen to their i-pod in the car.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A memory to this day.. It'a A Beautiful Day opened for Neil Diamond in the first fieldhouse concert i was ever at as a freshman at the University of Iowa in Iowa City,Ia. It was Oct.or Nov.of 1970. And when we heard that violin sound, we were blown away. Talk about Layla, and Stairway To Heaven sure. But in my mind, White Bird is right up there as a song for all time. The beginning plucks to the violin strings at the beginning of the song bring a wide smile every time i hear it. And it was just the beginning of so many wonderful shows at the fieldhouse, the Duane Allman Memorial Fieldhouse. It has always been great to be a Hawkeye but it was especially great in the days from '70-'74. Check this album out. Acehigh$LABEL$1,0,-100
Twenty Three Years Later.... We might know "Airport 75" right? Now Twenty Three years later, we have "Turbulence." Both are 747s, both have no pilots, both have to make emergency landing. This movie should have been aptly named "Airport 97." The only actor that could take a beating was the 747 itself. Everyone else was clueless and unrealistic. Only if stewardesses were given pilot licenses. Lauren Holly didn't need the hairspray that Karen Black needed in 75.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Joy Spring. If Clifford Brown had lived to make more recordings, he would be better known today, and this would be at the center of more collections.

A vintage recording without a "historical" feel to it, completely enjoyable today.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Form your own opinion. this is my first time seeing this movie and I was blown away by the performances. Jeffrey Wright is an underrated actor, wish we could see more of him. when the movie came out, i think on hbo, there was a negative critique given to this movie from a magazine that I supported. because of the critique, i wouldn't give this movie the time of day. i must say how wrong they were!!! this is an excellent movie and i no longer go by the reviews of others, i form my own opinion. will definitely add this movie to my collection.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Cheaper Than TurboTax, But Not Worth It. I used Turbo Tax for many years and every year it got better and better. Then I tried Tax Cut for two years in a row and was surprised how much clumsier of a program it was to use. I even ran into situations where I had to override TaxCut's built in methods to get certain things done correctly. I've never had to do so with Turbo Tax. I finally wrote on my file folder where I collect receipts for the coming tax years "Do Not Buy Tax Cut" so that I wouldn't forget.If you are doing a simple tax return then almost any software will do, but if you have a more complex return with rental properties, investments, trusts or anything else beyond normal wage and salary income and the common deductions then TurboTax is IMO the way to go.If your needs are fairly straightforward, then saving a few bucks by getting TaxCut might be OK.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Same as others with the breaking LCD screen what a bummer they should do some sort of testing with pressure placed on the screen and have to meet a minimum force to break.

A good looking, working tea kettle. What is there to say about a tea kettle? it handles the tea making just fine. The design is overall appealing, especially since I have matching teacups from another company. Like another review said, this comes with a removable whistle over the spout, not the lever.Cons: Besides the lack of the lever from the picture, the whistle is not very loud at first, so take that as a pro or con as you see fit.Also, the whistle is not going to work unless you completely close the top of the lid, and properly secure the whistle to the spout. Otherwise the steam just flows out random openings and does nothing.Only other downside is that the top of the kettle is kind of hard to remove, especially if you can only grip the little black nob due to heat.Overall, a working, good looking, teakettle, but I bought this for about half price. I wouldn't suggest it for its normal price though. If your going to spend over fifty dollers for a kettle, make sure its one you want.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Excellent coverage of exchange 5.5. Great book. I see that one of the reveiewers has stated that the book doesn't cover exchange in a wan/production environment, I agree but my advice would always be to buy more than one book when dealing with a product has huge as exchange 5.5.This book covers detailed using exchange in a single domain environment.
