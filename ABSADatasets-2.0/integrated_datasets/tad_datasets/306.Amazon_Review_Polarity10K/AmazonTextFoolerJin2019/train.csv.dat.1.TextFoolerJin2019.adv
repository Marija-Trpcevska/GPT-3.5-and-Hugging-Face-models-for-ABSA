Fairly palpable. Although you are looking for an overview of the causes of infertility, or are newly diagnosed with infertility, this might be a useful book. If you are an infertility patient you probably already know most of what is in it - for example it covers the testing that is done to determine causes of infertility.If you are looking for a really good explanation of how your body works, and how you can maximize your chances of getting pregnant, get Toni Weschler's "Taking Charge of Your Fertility". It's much more thorough and complete description of how you can increase your chances of getting pregnant.The section on mind/body is really stress reduction techniques, which are available in many other places. Infertility causes stress, and stress aggravates infertility, so stress reduction and coping strategies matter. However, buying a book on meditation will give you a much better introduction into how to use and apply the techniques described here.$LABEL$0,1,1

I bought it just for "A cowboy's born with a broken heart", expecting the rest to be in the same vein (at least the titles looked promissing). I don't know how the other albums by this band sound, but this is pathetic. You can hardly call this country music by any standard. The first couple of tracks sound more like "praise songs", the harmonies are almost gospel-like. The only tracks bearable are "In another tear from now", "If her heart ain't in Memphis" and the forementioned "A cowboy's born ...". Only the latter is really good, the other two being ruined somewhere down the line. ABSOLUTE LOW HOWEVER IS THE KINKS-COVER "YOU REALLY GOT ME".Verdict: one star for "A cowboy's born ..." and the effort. They should thank me for that one star.$LABEL$0,1,1

I also disagree when people say that this album get's five stars because sometimes you can't understand what the lead singer is saying.Well this cd really is good, but I'm sick of people saying this is the best cd because there is one diverse opera song.Best songs- Linoleum/Jeff Wears Birkenstocks/ Punk Guy$LABEL$1,1,0
JAMES BOND LOOSING. Why do most of John Gardner's James Bond novels seem like screenplays? I think that is what was always missing from his writings.

Lacking in the founding. Because with most pose books, there is a severe lack of detail and contrast in the photos. The purpose of this book is to provide an alternative to life drawing, but aground in the very aspect of life drawing that makes it so effective. With such poor photography, it is extremely difficult to discern the surface features that are so important to learning artistic human anatomy. While the poses have a slightly more natural bend than most books in this genre, there is still an unnatural stiffness, or exaggeration of movement that is rarely every desired in figure references. In addition, all of the models are young college age people, with little or no ethnic diversity.The overall direction of this book attempts to provide the artist with a holistic smattering of references in anatomy, movement and lighting, but fails in all three catagories, badly. I don't recommend this book to anyone with serious ambitions in learning to draw the human figure.$LABEL$0,1,1

Never to happen Mademoiselle. I am a life-long fan of Shirley Jackson and, especially, "The Haunting of Hill House." It is only recently that I have had the opportunity to read many of her works which, for some unknown reason, are out-of-print. "The Sundial" is, at the same time, psychologically unnerving and horribly humorous. It is keenly heartrending to read about the rantings of Aunt Fanny and the schemes of Fancy. But, at the same time, to imagine this handful of awful people who hate each other unendingly having to spend eternity with one another is incredibly funny. I must admit, I was a little disappointed when the book ended, but I realize that it must have been in the master plan of the author to leave the reader without the information which would have unnecessarily cleared up questions which will instead linger on the mind.$LABEL$1,1,0

I'm pretty approximate on the units... with wires being ran over with my chair wheels... preemie chewing on my microphone, the ear muffs being physically busted from being stepped on.... various things that happen blah blah... My last unit actually ever works great minus the physical damage my toddler and I did to it. I highly recommend this unit for media and gamming.I can't believe I got a like new unit for under $30 shipped. These are high quality and I remember when they were around $100 new (and still up there on some places on the net).$LABEL$1,1,0
Price is counterintuitive - buy it at shopkitchenaid.com. I saw in another review that someone regretted not purchasing it at the KitchenAid site. I just went to the KA site, didn't see the jar and partied with their online help - they did confirm to me that the "KitchenAid Pro Line Coffee Mill Replacement Bin" SKU:KPCGBIN was indeed the correct part. Oddly enough, there is no picture of the "bin" but that's why KA has an online help system I suppose. Anyway, I ordered two (one for backup just in case - mama isn't kind without her coffee). Total cost for two, shipped, plus tax was under $30.I'm all about making a profit but when you can get it for less than half price by going direct to the KA site, one would be foolish not to.Happy shopping!$LABEL$0,1,1

EEEEEPPPPPP! This Mouse Cackles!.... I received this mouse as a gift and I like it. It fits my hand perfect (as a right hander.) If a left hander were to use my mouse they would find it very uncomfortable (if using with their left hand.) The thumb button is great to re-program for games. The wheel is smoother then the Microsoft Optical counterpart.I use the keyboard whenever possible for shortcut keys but some activities such as surfing the web and playing games can be greatly enhanced by having a good mouse. This mouse has fulfills all the needs I have.Optical is the way to go if you spend large amounts of time at a PC. It avoids the snags and slowdowns of non-optical mice. The optical logo is nice if your in the dark (and your monitor goes to sleep) so you can quickly grab the mouse and active the monitor.This is a great affordable mouse. It's a must get if your still using a non-optical or non-wireless mouse!$LABEL$1,1,0

another Childhood Idiosyncratic Lir. My grandson, 3 yrs old, is a big fan of Thomas the Tank. This classic tale has become a favorite already, I think because it does have colorful drawings of the story and, it is about trains. He thinks twice now about saying " I can't". If he does, Grandma quietly repeats " I think I can, I think I can...". He will grin and forge ahead with the task or skill he was attempting.It is often one of his picks for a bedtime story.

Fine, but . . .. This could be the kind of novel that readers love -- a keep-you-on-edge-of-your-seat kind of novel. But somewhere along the line, the writer has to deliver, has to get the reader to believe in something, even if there's an unexpected twist at the end. This novel never makes the last jump. Even at the end, you're left with questions, unsatisfied. The writing is good -- different because its third person, present tense -- but expert. Only the ending, the relationship between the two primary characters, rings false. I would read more books by Mr. Stone in spite of my reservations about this one.

DVD Packaging is UNACCEPTABLE!. What is WRONG with this enterprising? Season 11 was released with packaging that didn't allow for removing the discs without destroying them. You can't take them out to play or you risk ruining them. BEAST!!!Virtually every review by customers complained about this and it looks like sales plummented for season 12. I am a hardcore fan, BUT...I want new boxes for seasons 11 and 12, or I won't be purchasing ANYTHING from them again.Season six shipped with a new format package and cover (which didn't ruin the DVDs) and eventually FOX offered a replacement box so that it matched seasons 1 - 5. You would have figured that FOX learned their lesson from this. The show is great, no denying it, but their decision to change the packaging to this complete crap format cannot be tolerated.A mistake for season 11, it is inexcusable to repeat the mistake for season 12!I am done...up yours, FOX...$LABEL$0,1,1

Ok output, accesories needed and wrench neglecting. I used the Tool Force product for several hrs; I was trying to spray latex paint onto a wooden surface.Things I knew:1)I would need additional accessories that did not come with the gun (water/oil separator)2)The included 2.0 tip is recommended to spray latex paint.Things I did not know:1)The gun came with the 1.4 tip pre installed. I attempted to remove the 1.4 tip but the open ended wrench bent. I soldered on.2)1.4mm is too small for latex materials (unless you want to use the gun all day)3)I couldn't find a replacement wrench and thus the gun is ruined (full of dried paint)4)A $10 equivalent (sans the 2.0mm tip) is available at your local harbor freight.If the wrench wasn't so cheaply made, I would be giving this product a 4 star rating. Tool Force is probably made by the same people who made the HF model. They look identical. I would opt for the cheaper option and buy the 2.0 tip separately if I was doing this again.$LABEL$0,1,1

LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. I think that the Lemony Snicket Filming was big! There's only one thing I can say unwholesome about it: Klaus (pronounced Kl-OW-ss and not Clause) just wasn't right! He didn't have glasses and his face just wasn't, well, right! Liam Aiken is a great actor and all but just not right for the role. Other than that, it was great. I will admit I was a bit worried about Jim Carrey as Count Olaf (I thought he might be a bit TOO goofy) but he turned out to be great for the part. And all the other characters were great, too, especially Violet. I definitely recommend seeing this movie. It was great and you won't regret it!$LABEL$1,1,0

Note that I did not wear the shoes from my car in the parking lot to the office. I put them on once I arrived in the office, and I sat at my desk for the majority of the day.

Books parts tend to load onto the player out of order even when you've synced them to the player in order. The most common problem is that part 10 will come after part 1 of the book so if you're not paying attention you're suddenly at the end of the book.

A Grandiose Pioneer Aviation Book. Ms. Cummins has produced a very attractive small volume on Blanche Stuart Scott, pioneer aviator. The volume is well designed, as might be expected from a mainline publisher (Harper Collins) and the text is informative. While the book yields a good notion of who Ms. Stuart Scott was, a better exposition of Ms. Stuart Scott's 'crustiness' would probably have increased our understanding. There are the inevitable errors, of course, including an unfortunate caption of a photograph (on page 49) mistakenly identifying Lincoln Beachey as the aviator of a Wright biplane. Also, there is confusion about the supposed role of a non-existent sand bag in the fatal fall of Harriet Quimby and William Willard at Squantum, Massachusetts, in 1911. Taken as a whole, however, this book is well worth the purchase price and adds to our knowledge of one of the most colorful aviators of the pre-WWI period.$LABEL$1,1,0

A back yard full of troubled `lonely crowd' urban neighbors in 1950's New York. Bring in a salesman (Raymond Burr) neighbor (could it be Willie Loman going off the edge) in an lamentable marriage.

By the time Stewart and crew are done old Raymond Burr is going to need more than Perry Mason to get out of this fix. A word on Grace Kelly.

Clumsily analyzes over 2,000 of Koryusai's designs. Isoda Koryusai produced thousands of designs between 1769 and 1781, a crucial period in the Japanese print tradition era, and though he was honored in Japan for his works, he's been largely neglected by western art scholars. Allen Hockley's The Prints Of Isoda Koryusai deftly analyzes over 2,000 of Koryusai's designs, surveying his influence as a minor Edo-period artist and arguing that Koryusai excelled in his output and his creation of popular commodities. The Prints Of Isoda Koryusai is essential reading for any student of Japanese printmaking history and artists.$LABEL$1,1,0

Perhaps if the book had not received the prize and so much praise I would have been pleasantly surprised, but after all the hype I would tend to agree with the dissenters here below, that The Hours, although superbly crafted and elegantly written, is a vacancies and ultimately unnerving mention to Virginia Woolf's masterpiece. Cunningham's prose moved me, but his invented characters did not. (Of course Virginia herself is untouchable.)

Insipid and grotesque. A unmitigated plight to the author. Blunt and naughty written. After pressuring myself to earn through the first 45 pages, I handed up.

Dissapointing. I feel I must approbation with Greg segundo. To pointed a movie wasn't good because it wasn't the same as the book it was based upon is ridiculous, for film must follow different conventions than the written word. HOWEVER, that maxim is true only most of the time. Sometimes, what was left out of a film in the transfer from book to screen would gets made a smoother cinematic prints . Such is the case with "A Simple Plan". Scott Smith more than likely felt compelled to water down his novel to fit Hollywood's narrow views of what makes a successful movie. He probably felt he had managed to still retain the spirit and impact of the book. Sorry,Scott, but I disagree. It was bungled badly, and what could have been a truly chilling morality tale ended up a by the numbers actiion thriller, with a thin moral fabric tacked on as an afterthought. Fair at best, only because a fine cast of actors save what should have rated zero stars. A dissapointment.$LABEL$0,1,1

Cold and unmoving. In 1970, Twentieth Century Fox frees "M*A*S*H," a huge box-office smash that put Elliott Gould on the map, and established Robert Altman, a veteran director of TV's "Bonanza," as one of the important figures of 1970's cinema. Much like Hawkins, Altman quickly kindled out, and there's miraculously a unleashing of imagination to be felt in "Quintet."Set in some barren wasteland of the future, it involves a macabre twist on backgammon in which the loser is murdered. The location, a snow swept Montreal, and the contrasting claustrophobic interior scenes, are appealing to the eye, and the cast, headed by Paul Newman, is not without interest.But "Quintet" is as cold and unmoving as its landscapes, simply another credit in Altman's filmography that boasts of his maverick credentials, but makes you wonder why "maverick credentials" are something to boast about.Brian W.

this is banger. ok i know bands are supposed to evolve into newer sounds. however, they've completely lost that gritty sound that made them so appealing, the lyrics are mediocre at best (esp bev. hills & we are all on drugs are painful to listen to) and the album lacks the intensity of several of the previous ones. and i have a high tolerance for crappy weezer. of course i liked blue and pinkerton best. but i liked maladroit too! and even green! but this is marginally acceptable. Rivers Cuomo is essentially mocking me because i know he can do better and he isn't, on purpose, just to piss me off. I mean, i heard they picked from over 200 songs the ones that go on this album, and that makes me wonder what the rejected songs sound like (really really bad?) and how much time they actually spend on each song.

Collimation Facile Done. When I received it the collimation was off. Rather than send it back and risk getting another pair that was off, I called Celestron. The "Life Time No Fault Warranty" only applies if you get it from an "authorized" dealer even though my pair was new. Which means you need to pay like $200+ for these to actually have a warranty. However I asked if I could collimate it myself even though the manual says it should only be done by a professional with specialized tools. They could not or would not tell me anything about how to collimate it. Luckily I did find some general instructions on the web and found the prism tilt screws to turn and got it perfect. You need to gently pry back the edge of the rubber hand grips to access the screws. It whole process wasn't even that difficult! I don't know why it has to be such a state secret with Celestron. Since then the binos have been wonderful and well worth the discount of buying from an "unauthorized dealer".$LABEL$1,1,0
He was sizable!. I read this book a few months after it came out and have suggestions it to different since. The narration takes place in the San Francisco bay area and makes its way to the pacific coast and all the way to eastern Canada.

Her installed in perfectly, The story is about his Aunt (who is in a bad marriage) and who falls head over heals for an eligible bachlor -- a pianist who is gay. I think everyone in this story had 'a few screws loose'. This made the story all the more pleasing because in everyone's life there are people like this.The main charactor turns out to be Nicholas's aunt Joyclyn. The ending may surprise you.

I LET IT AN 8 BUT NOT 10 !. I must say that this is a allright book for everyone who want to learn JAVA. But I am sorry to say that this book is only a refrence for JAVA but not a bible for JAVA. I have to say that because in this book the authors only briefly show the way to compile the source code and not explain it in detial. This problem may be seem is minor, but for a new programmer this is a great problem. This is because when we save our file with the .java, what appear in the screen is another name. For example if the programmer save the file as MyFile.java, the name that appears in the screen is MyFi~1.jav, so he will compile it with "javac MyFi~1.jav" because this is file that show in the screen. In this section, I think the way that presented by the book "Teach yourself JAVA in 21 days" is better. I hope that the authors can take note about it and have a great improvement in the next book. Finally I would like to say this is a good book but a perfect one !$LABEL$1,1,0

The only reason to read this book is if your religious or other beliefs prevent you from reading a real thriller (such as one written by Thomas Perry or James W.

The Advisable Guidebook on Describe Ever Written!. This book was supplied to me on my birthday over twenty-seven years ago. I glanced at it briefly, and since that time it sat on my bookshelf gathering dust. What a mislead. Just the other day I was having some trouble with a story character, and piled it up with some others covering the same subject for later use. What a gold mine of incisive instruction! I can't put it down. Although written in 1942 (ironically the year of my birth), absolutely everything Ms. Elwood presents today is right on target. Writtten with step-by-step perfection, she teaches "show not tell" better than any "live" instructor I've ever sat under. You must have this book!$LABEL$1,1,0

This book marked my 4-year-old.. I preface this by saying that every kid/parent has different preferences and I may not the best judge. But I just didn't know this ledgers. And neither did my four year old, who was terrified and in tears half way through. The page where the bullies hit the kid was so scary for him.

Audio book by Nathaniel Parker: Charlie Higson: Blood Fever. Listening to any audio book read by Nathaniel Parker is always a joy. This Young Bond story turns out quite sinister including lots of killings of more or less innocent people (which to my knowledge is the tendency of the adult James Bond stories,too). The plot is altogether clever, unconvincing and surprising to the very end. The story starts with an idyllic scene in the Greek archipelago and gets soon to Eton College from where some boys and teachers James Bond including travel for the summer holiday to the island of Sardinia and get involved with art thieves, pirates and bandits. The course of events is directed by the local rich lunatic who naturally wants even more power over other people and helds as a prisoner the compulsory young beautiful English girl for James Bond to rescue.Nathaniel Parker as the reader makes this story even more live and exciting by his marvelous characterizations and strong empathizing with the interpretation.$LABEL$1,1,0

NOT as advert in picture and NOS worthwhile 50 dollars. One would assume that if you are going to spend fifty dollars on a spice rack, there would be no skimping on quality. The picture and descriptions of this item would have you believe that the spice holders themselves would be stainless steel or some form of at least aluminum. They even add a nice metallic sheen in the picture. In addition, you would think that with fifty dollars they would make the core glass or at least a strong composite. The shakers clear area is a cheap plastic. The stand itself appears durable but the shaker color does not match the stainless steel stand or my other stainless appliances. It actually looks cheap next to them. I would not recommend this product and will likely return this item. Positives include a strong base and magnets that work.

A great insight for a livres, but messed up by authors' poor workplace. paras extraordinary idea for a pamphlets, but the schoolbooks is messed up by the authors' silliness and self-indulgence. Had the authors just dealt with their things, it would be five stars. Instead,the manuel experiencing from two major anxieties. Originally, almost every paras is replete with childish "inside" jokes, silliness asides (invariably Lefist where they are politifal), imbecilic puns and similar self-indulgent stupidity, apparently included to show how clever the authors are. Instead, all this junk just distracts from any discussion and generally leaves the reader grinding his teeth in annoyance. Second, there are serious and repeated errors in the descriptions of the movie plots. Did the authors actually watch all the films discussed, or did they rely on others (grad students, perhaps?) for some of the material? My conclusion is that the topic is well worth a book, and its a shame the authors made such a mess of this one.$LABEL$0,1,1

Goldsmith Borrows paras Little from Itself. With a career spanning over four decades, Goldsmith has attained a position as one of the movie's most prolific and innovative composers. Although his work during the past ten years does not compare to his landmark work of the 60's and 70's, he did do two exemplary scores in the 90's: one is the music to "The Ghost in the Darkness" and "Total Recall."What does "Recall" such a winner is that it seems to pay homage to Goldsmith's earlier triumphs. One can hear "The Omen," "Planet of the Apes," the underrated "Secret of N.I.M.H" and even "Gremlins" in the otherworldly melodies used to complement the film. There is much originality in this composition with the opening and closing themes being especially awesome in their execution. But it is the patented Goldsmith "touches" that make this one significant and a worthy, albeit unintended, "introduction" for those who are just discovering the composer.$LABEL$1,1,0

I Didn't Understand, So I watched it again. me first vu the movie on PBS. I didn't fully understand who some of the characters were and how they fit into the picture. I bought the movie unless that I could watch it again. I now understand what was going on. I know things back then are not the way they are now, except the fact that most of the time money is everything. Why did we did from there to here? Some standards have gone down the trash. The ladies and gentlemen all talk so proper. Lizzie is so stubborn. But her mother got to me the most. I found her nagging voice very irritating and the way she could change her opinion of other people so quickly so she does not look stupid to her family and friends. Mr.Darcy is proof that you can change the first impression you give other people. But it also helps you to see that if you never tell anyone how you feel, how will you ever know how they feel.

SUIS JAMAIS find a self motorized vacume!! Way to heavy!. I haya my heart set on a self propell vac because I have a nefarious back. Until 14 month the self propell bailed! It is now facile to push my car down the street then push this question across the livingroom because the self propell unit within the vacume is so laborious, it really weighed the vacume down. It still coups glorious but if I'm going to keep useing it I will have to go back to physical therapy.This thing is such a tank if you run into a pice of furniture it will dent your furniture!Carring it up and down the stairs while trying to vacume is impossible.

McCormick Grill Mates Pork Rub.

Five fame, for Erin Grey, not Gil Gerard. The price of this DVD set can not be overpower. If you are a fan of this series and you want to watch these episodes again, you won't go misleading in getting this.But as I watched the shows, it was Erin Grey who really stood out. After watching a handful I predicted what Buck would do. Gil Gerard must have had a "kick" clause in his contract because that's all this guy did in every episode. Season one of course was much better. There's only thirteen episodes in season two, which meant it was thirteen too many.The guest stars here really stood out and that's why I am glad I own this.

Mr. Vengeance ignoring miserably at creating any sort of effect whatsoever. The storyline is a bit challenged, if you ask me. There is no real feeling of revenge and most of the time the screenplay with characters coming in and going out creates confusion. It took me a while to understand what's actually going on. I watched this 40 days back and can't even recall what happens in the end.

MPS5280. I found this handbook in our adoption agency and assumed to shop it. I like the fact that it's easy to read and that it mentions high level milestones for my son. While I didn't give birth, I think it gives common foreboding advice to mom's about recovery and the linked advice is true whether you adopt or give birth. If you are looking for a vitally thorough book, this is not the one, but for something high level (believe me, I have Dr. Sears book and several other's that I think are way too much to read during the first few months). Not to mention in those books, my son who was born 4 weeks early may or may not fit the timeframe. This book makes it easier to relate to since it's my month and if he doesn't fit the timeframe, it's high level enough to know it's okay if he's not reached that milestone yet. I recommend this book for new parents and as a shower/baby gift.$LABEL$1,1,0

new peculiarity. I've been using Petmate water fountains for a few years now, tending to get a couple of years of use out of them. For the price, the amount of use (two cats) and hair I'm usually cleaning out of the pump, it seems reasonable to me. I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow, is usually quiet (unless there's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir) and the cats have no problem drinking from it. Those are its pros, along with its price (much better than the version that the vet pushes). However, I've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning, which cost it a star (not sure if it'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so).$LABEL$1,1,0

Looks cool, evil coffee. Life is just too short to get frustrated by bad coffee every morning. A decent cup (or three) of *strong* coffee is all I require - is this too much to ask? Apparently so for this machine. It looks cool and the carafe feels heavy and high quality, but the coffee is really slight and fearsome. I have been putting in 2-3 extra scoops of grounds and I still don't like the coffee. Now, I feel like I'm just throwing good money after bad by wasting all that extra coffee grounds. Plus, the warming plate keeps the coffee way too hot and it tastes burned within 15 minutes or so. I figured out why the coffee is so weak - the hot water only sprays out of one little hole onto the grounds - my previous Krups had about 6 little holes to "shower" the coffee grounds.

A highlight is "Hella Good," which is from the roc steady albums. Over all, I views that this is an album shouldnt all about change, as is the band. They have gone from scrappy kids who like Ska, to neo New wavers in 10 years. They have a way of paying homage to their influences, while claiming the styles for their own in a way that no other band is capable of. the only thing that would make it better is if this record was sequenced chronologically, either in correct, or reverse order, so the listener could take the journey with the band, instead of having it scattered around.$LABEL$1,1,0

Big Disaffected. I have itl incalculable of Miss Thompson's books and liked most of them. I lir this book in the Kindle version, and I don't know what happened to it. The mistakes were still many that I kept asking myself why me withheld on lire. Proofread, misplaced sentenced smithereens, and stable out wrong paroles just jump out at me. The epic did hold me for a while. But then I had more than a fourth to go and just got tired of the distruction and human suffering. I don't know the history of this great hurricane, but many of the scenes were unbelievable even in the name of fiction. Sorry, Janice, I had to quit the book before I finished it.

Needy quality controll with no Manufacture favours. The First Aid [2.0] kit I had was of poor quality. The right stitched on hte left inside pockets was only sewn 1/2 way to the bottom. See Summits posted. Needles gaps could be been in the plastics and I called the manufacture who substantiate the ladle should be stitched all the way. I urge them Without they would support their generated and they would not. That was clearly a manufacturing defect and the Manufacture (or should I say importer) told me they could not help me and to return it to where I bought it from. The case was made overseas with the finest of craftmanship NOT. Hopefully the seller will replace the defective item.

ALARMING, DOES NOT REPRESENT VIEW OF MOST CHRISTIANS. Horrified is the key word here. I am awed at Andrews' views so much that this is the first book for which I am writing a review. I am a born again Christian, I know my bible and love the Lord but and am sickened by Christians who take this viewpoint, and sad to think that other people think this is how Christians operate. Andrews' advice to a friend about his daughter, and the description of him and a male teacher "FORCING" a 6th grade boy to submit to corporal punishment 2 or 3 times in a row, then each time forcing the boy to put his arms around Andrews' neck to hug him back, is SICK. MY ADVICE IS - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. I cringe at Christians like this, and feel very sorry for their families and the people who are influenced by or affected by their viewpoints. The only reason I gave this book one star is because I couldn't give it zero or minus stars. Andrews made a few good points but there have to be better books out there.$LABEL$0,1,1
A garish idealist, bewildering. This is a very interesting book, but people looking for an easy read with simply-constructed theses should look elsewhere. Pinchbeck approaches his writing as serious science and the text is thick with philosophy, psychology and more.The theories advanced by Pinchbeck are mostly collected theories of others who came before him, enhanced by his own experiences with psychodelics. Some of it will be scoffed at by people who have made up their minds about the way things are and Pinchbeck both acknowledges this and expects it.Early in the book, he turns these people on their heads and sweeps them aside, inviting the curious and those readers with a will to think about things beyond the way they have been explained, beyond the way we are most comfortable with, to read on.Do I buy what Pinchbeck is selling? Some of it, sure. Some of it seems a stretch, but some of it is intriguing. Don't buy this book looking for alternative answers, buy it if you're looking for a thinker.$LABEL$1,1,0

Don't Worry. I absolutely gonna to adores this book; the plot sounded phenomenal, and it started off okay, but the more I reads it, the biggest it enjoys.

Mr. Dirgo is arguably a Clive Cussler midshipman, but has neither the visions or story-telling talented (not to mention indispensable grab of the British linguistic) to even are raised in the same puffing as Cussler.

Grandiose. What the heck is wrong with North American radio? I know...it's a rhetorical question but one that needs to be asked. Especially when it ignores wonderful albums like H.M.S. Fable. This is dense, fluid, passionate music rich in melodies, potent in vocals and song-writing. And, it's by yet another ignored Britpop band. There seems to be no stomach for bands like this one, Shed Seven, Cast, etc. in Canada and the U.S. And, it takes a huge label push to make Travis a "hit" here as well. More fool us. This is yet another album I recommend to people who think rock is dead. No way, No how. Michael Head is a superb writer and performer and the group scores on each of the album's 12 cuts. Check out "Comedy" in particular. It'll remind you of The Beatles, The Byrds, The Moody Blues and more sixties acts.

Roughly as Compelling as Me Finishing This Title. I managed to find out that this book wasn't expensive or even rare, as it seems to be. It's just obscure and neglected, and for once, I wish it would be kept that way. The sum of this hundred pp book is: persuasive. It's a theory based on looking at a few flags and thinking to yourself "Hey, these are similar." One of the ideas used to support the theory in this book is the lack of evidence in the formation of Switzerland, and then the large omission of time between that and the Swiss bankers infamous today. There is little concrete historical reality beyond a few fantasmic imaginations and a lack of true Templar scholarship. While I like to believe that some Templars survived the Inquisition, and God knows they did, there is no way, simply no way that a lack of evidence refutes and/or supports evidence.$LABEL$0,1,1

From that said, this book is as tight to repudiate Silverberg wanna get. What a tiring just to get through it. Both schoolbooks should have been edited to lesser than 100 pages because nothing really ever arrive, a whiny, flawed, racist, ex-king/future king recants old stories from his youth amidst a swirling future backdrop that is poorly built except for small snatches. Only a few worlds and technologies and cultural ideas get elaborated upon. And I found the ghosting done only by gypsies into the past and present and future to be fairly stupid and ill-conceived. Some parts were interesting but most of time I found myself saying...I think I care, I think I care, I think I care, I think I don't.$LABEL$0,1,1

I saw a review on there talking about how they wantto it made a "Desoldering pump" My solder-friendly friends told me they had never heard of a "Desoldering Pump". This is likely why-a product this vulnerable is not worth notoriety. The pump is incredibly humble, and functioning about 1 in 10 attempts.

Potboiler, steps along but very plausible. This is a historical naval book with a lead character much like Alistair MacLean heroes - obstinate, insubordinate, convinced he's smarter than anyone else, declamatory, and full of action. The novelist has his character speaking in little cliches to himself - in for a penny in for a pound Halfhyde! The action progresses well and the historical setting, as far as I can tell, is accurate. Battle sequences are stirring, but all in all .... The entire finish of the book hangs on a monstrous coincidence between nature starting her battle at the same time that the Japanese fire their guns. Unbelievable, and a bit too coy, also bad geology.$LABEL$0,1,1

Right??Don't believes everything you read.I struggled about a terzi of the way into the 600 page novel before I realized this was one of the worst fantasy novels I had ever read. Never mind the derivative story; the novel itself is badly written. One of the most glaring problems is the excessive use of passive voice.

I am still not clear on the cross dresser double personality thing.I love Jennifer Cruise, and have read all of her books, but I really like her earlier ones. It seems like the last couple I have read just don't quite measure up to those. She seems to be trying to top herself, and to my mind, getting so far out there that her books are no longer quite so enjoyable. I generally consider this genre to be "lighter" reading. Something to enjoy while I relax after work.In this book I could not even keep track of the characters. I just could not get into it.

Due to the poor quality of the art, I find it very difficult to even read the contents. I guess I will just have to keep waiting for Path of Daggers!! If you want to see excellant drawings based on the the Wheel of Time series, I suggest checking out the work of Richard Boye and/or Dragonluv on the web... at least they read the series. -Kinslayer$LABEL$0,1,1

That "Ghostbusters" is still a affordable knock off. I remember seeing one episode of this as a little girl, and being confused and disappointed that it was not a continuation of the awesome movie starring Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd.I could not understand why there were two ghostbuster cartoons that looked so different, both in character, content and plot quality.Now, at least I understand why the original franchise relabeled themselves "The Real Ghostbusters" to avoid any ruckus with this saddened series. The cartoony ghosts and ghostbusting gorila do absolutely nothing for the plot. I honestly cannot see how this series was made considering the original one was the big money and merchandise maker.Even after all of these years, the series is still a waste of time for people expecting to see something like the movie. Save yourselves time and money and just look for the other series.$LABEL$0,1,1
Attainable, though not on Amazon. i Googled this, and deems it on another site:[...].I never got to see "Tonka" on tv or screen, as a kid all i had was a book of it. but i too was taken by the story, and it has remained an interest since then, perhaps sparking my underway interest in American Indian history and heritage. Instead, not very from where we live here in Kansas, is the museum in Lawrence where the (badly) stuffed remains of Comanche are on exhibit. I always found it rather funny that he is positioned in his glass case with hindquarters facing the room, as though he wants to protect the many NA greats pictured in the case he faces.$LABEL$1,1,0
A Trip Inferior Souvenirs Aisles. I remember when I was very little (can't believe I actually remember it that far), my parents bought me this album on cassette. It reminds me of both times my family and I went to Walt Disney World. I lost the cassette tape years ago, and I was surprised to find this album on CD, so I had to order it. The renditions of conventional Disney music are glamorous. Olivia Newton-John's rendition of "Part of Your World" is just beautiful. The Disney Big Band medley of "The Mickey Mouse Club" and "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" reminds me of my recent trip to WDW. And, "Remember the Magic" as sung by Brian McKnight always brings joyful tears to my eye. Highly recommended by me to any Disney fan out there. It's well worth the money. Now I have something relaxing to listen to while doing homework in my small college dorm room.$LABEL$1,1,0
Sizable Ring!. This ring is jamil. I've had it for about a month now and it still shines! There is a very small gap between the rings, but I don't see what the problem with that is (it is two rings after all)! Everyone that I have shown it to cannot tell that it is not real. There is some wear on the side of the ring that rubs the other but its on the inside where you don't see it. I use it as my wedding set and wear it everyday with no discoloration and wash my hands with it on with no problems. This is a beautiful ring and I would highly recommend it :)$LABEL$1,1,0

has quality but no plot. I am not sure why I saw this movie, its not usually the kind of movie I like. I probably just was in a bad mood and wanted to see loads of pale people in dark clothes, blood, full moon and rainy streets. So far, so ok. It is a well made story, though I am not sure what the story is. It is entertaining and it makes some effort with creating an appropriate atmosphere including the way it is told by a narrator. The movie has some highlights (I esp. like the scene where half of his head slips off) but it lacks from the absence of a "hero(ine)" or whatever central character to identify with. It would make a good pc-game without much alteration.$LABEL$1,1,0

Yuck!. I expected a morose, terse, stunning revulsion film. Still, I got this. Here, no onslaught to the inhabitants who conducted it, but this was the most disheartening films upon...(fifteen seconds afterward)...since...Anyhow, I didn't like it. It didn't afraid me at all (okay, the photographing with Ark, Samara, and the TELE was a MINOR piece creepy). Authentic, I deems it was more comedy than horror, such as the scene my friends and I have dubbed "The Suicidal Demon Horse Scene!" (I cracked up when I saw that, not that there's anything funny horses die).And another thing! People in horror movie's are SO STUPID. It really ticks me off. I was near the end of the movie, and Rachel (was that her name?) was trapped in the well, and she finds (spoilers) and I'm like "WHY THE HECK DID YOU WATCH THAT STUPID TAPE IN THE FIRST PLACE!?"There were really two things I liked.

The lead character, Will Chambers is a fledgling Christian who is working on his spiritual life in addition to the action in the main storyline.

When I was done programing it, and authorisation it do its work I noticed 3 hours later the time was off and the timer programmes I had put in where erased. Because it enjoy an AA batery, I accommodated a brand new one meantime this corrects the problem.Programed the timer again and the next day the same thing. The time was off and could not access the programing area beacuse it seemed frozen. I reseted, and placed it on manual and turned the heater on for 3 days and did not disconfigurate. After those 3 days, i programed the timer again and the same thing happend, lost all configuration. I called Intermatic and they were of no help.

Double Responsibility Takings: Advisable for Removing Long Last Lip Color. I use these pads every day for effortless removal of long lasting lip color such as Cover Girl Outlast, Revlon Colorstay Overtime and Max Factor Lipfinity. The pads are very thin and are saturated with an oil-based liquid.They are also good for removing waterproof mascara, but they do leave oily residue around the eyes. For that reason, when I wear regular non-waterproof mascara, I prefer to take it off with the other formula of Almay eye makeup remover pads that are non-oily.Both of these Almay products are great for travel as they are lightweight, thin and you can put several pads in a zip-lok baggie without taking up much space at all.

"The melodramatic King, from Da' Boogie Down Bronx!!". "Commentating, illustrating/ description given, adjective pundits..." were the ain launched, jaw dropping, opening words on the ground-breaking, mega Hip-Hop conventional, hit-single "IT'S YOURS". Although the lyrics on "IT'S YOURS" were written by his older brother "SPECIAL K" (member of the Treacherous 3), T La Rock would later team up with producer extraordinaire and master of the beat "MANTRONIK", and put out a string of classic hits through out the mid '80's.

I proposition these Audiovox CD players to everyone with kinder. They are fabulous. The screen quality is excellent and the sound is too. Oh and the kids love having thier own remotes to operate it. As I always say....happy kids...happy parents! Thank you. Mrs. S. Brown - Tenafly, NJ$LABEL$1,1,0

What a Consternation!. I had looked forward to this ledgers very much. I am astounded with livre and their history, and the background and subject matter give this book an entirely different level for enjoyment.But I have had it with the hero: Alex Plumtree who is beginning to look more and more like the world's biggest patsy. The things which happen to him, mostly brought about by people who "have been sworn to secrecy" or who "just want to protect him" boggle the imagination. It's time he stood up to his "friends" and said, "Enough already." Unless of course he enjoys being the fool.$LABEL$0,1,1
Admirable tool. We had two cheap department store pepper mills that were driving me crazy. I love to cook and if you're making a large pot of anything or seasoning a roast to go in the oven it took forever to get enough pepper ground. In addition, I have carpal tunnel so not only was I frustrated, it was painful too! I didn't particularly want to spend $50-$100 to get a really "good" pepper mill. This pepper mill, like all the Oxo products I've tried, is well made and extremely well designed for doing the job it was meant for with maximum comfort and maximum efficiency. Thank goodness there are companies like Oxo!$LABEL$1,1,0

Enjoys a little funny moments. This movie has some good moments that generated a few laughs from a chuckle to a gut busting guffaw. Then it got funny and laughable.$LABEL$0,1,1
Adore A Train Wreck---I Still Watched It. This is supposed to be a remake of a French film; I haven't seen the French version, which is just as well, because a film should stand on its own merits.With the exception of several, isolated, instances, this comedy is not slapstick. The problem is the script and therefore the directing, pure and simple, not the acting. Regardless of the French version, this is another instance of an old, re-rehashed theme beaten to death by Hollywood: a social misfit who accidentally creates havoc gets superglued to the straight guy, driving him bonkers, but by the end of the film the misfit endears himself to the straight guy and even saves him from some problem or other. Like I said, an old, old cliche done to death (You Me and Dupree is a relatively recent one, for example; What About Bob? had the saving grace that the straight guy never embraces the misfit and is instead driven mad).$LABEL$0,1,1
Languorous, Beautiful Movie. Texas used to be owned by Mexico before the U.S. occupied Mexico City in 1847 and in 1848 a peace treaty was signed; Mexico ceded Texas, California and New Mexico (including all the present-day states of the Southwest).Anyway, I forgot about this bit of U.S. history and this movie reminded me of that, which is an enlightening part of its subplot.With this in the backdrop, the romantic love story between Tita and Pedro unfolds.If you remember ever being truly in-love, I feel some scenes will remind you of that feeling, what a nice surprise...$LABEL$1,1,0
Tea time bonheur.... I'm a groupie of Margaret Rutherford and Agatha Christie...unless this is a charming, delightful manner to allocate a bit of period...better judged with hot tea and doughnuts.$LABEL$1,1,0
didn't adore it. I came across this schoolbooks looking for one about cancer and view it sounded (and looked) startling. He wasn't! The whole almanac is just reading several e-mails the playwright and her folks developed to each other, and more than half the era I didn't acquaintance what they were chatter about. me didn't even am who these populace were to the playwright (like siblings, Aunt, cetera., I KNEW they were dawgs,) and what some of the things and places mentioned were. It got confusing the more I read and there wasn't much explaination about subjects being discussed, since these were just letters between two people. I found the book very boring and couldn't even get through the whole thing. Very disappointing.$LABEL$0,1,1
