Junk being shipped as the better item. This is the item being shipped out instead of the better, higher quality item you see when searching for this costume.

strangely idiomatic faust from Russia. If you're not put off by Faust in Russian, this isn't a bad performance.It might help explain why Faust was so popular a hundred years ago and nowstrikes us as a bit of a bore. Kozlovksy is one of the best Fausts on discbut he is not as subtle as in some of his other performances. Shumskaya is alsonot as good as on her Traviata -- she seemed to develop something of a slavicspinto after 1947 so she is edgier here and has no trill. Reizen is a goodmephistopheles but overacts. Still, it is a lively performance, well conductedby Nelboussine and even includes some of the ballet music.$LABEL$1,0,-100

This film is a bunch of horse you-know-what. A 10 year old could have done a better job directing. It's *sort* of about a horse, it's *sort* about an owner, it's *sort* about the comeback of trainer, but only skims all of them while indulging us in none. You can't blame the cast - these people are good, yet completely disengaged while on screen. Malkovich is hurrying through it as if he's got something better to do (he probably did!) and Ozzy Ozborn would have been more convincing as the owner than Diane Lane. A complete disservice dealt to the greatest racehorse that ever lived. Watch Seabiscuit instead. That was excellent and everything this should have been.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A first rate overview of the first decade. This two-disc package is a great buy. It contains a smorgasbord of great goals and game highlights, with informative and interesting insights from many of the coaches and key players involved in the games. I've watched it and rewatched it several times, with undiminished pleasure. (I have only one quibble. To my mind, Bergkamp's superbly acrobatic goal--ranked as the second best of the first decade--is far more impressive than Beckham's long-range--and rather lucky--effort, which is ranked as the best of the decade.)$LABEL$1,0,-100
Good size and worked well.. Only owned one day but tested out and worked well. In a room around 72F after a little over two hours it was at 30F empty using the optional power adapter. Placing 3 glass bottles of soda brought it up to 40F after a short time. It took about 3 hours to chill them and bring the temp back down to 32F. Switching to heat mode it took less then 1 hour to bring the empty cooler to well over 75F again. Fridge thermometer was buried so I don't know exactly.Overall I think that it performed as advertised and will work out fine. The P95 is a perfect size for personal use and trips to grocery stores not close to home. It's not huge but it's not small either, good mid-sized choice.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Good quality but poor performance. The quality of the unit is done well, but the performance was much worse than I anticipated. The monitor operates on the 900 MHZ band, which is used by many devices. The camera was on the second story of our house, and the video monitor was in our bedroom on the first floor about 45 feet away. We also have wireless LAN and wireless phones (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz). Regardless of how much I adjusted antennas and channel settings, the picture and sound quality was very poor. The sound always had a large amount of interference even at very low volume levels. I would not recommend using this product unless the camera and monitor were very close together and other wireless interference was limited. There are higher frequency monitors, so I may try one of those next.The infrared picture worked well - you could see fairly well even though the room had almost no light.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A good book for the newcomer to art.... but nothing new for the artist. That said, the book is nevertheless well written. The style is reminiscent of the creative flow experience itself. This book does a good job helping the newbie to understand what flow feels like and how to obtain that state. The exercises are very practical and tend to balance the "flow-like" text. I loved the illustrations. I keep going back to the book just to look at the art work.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Very thoughtful, many ideas shared by a great author. Actually I bought this book for strictly "scholar" reasons. It was the right one to buy, brought me a few thoughts, also, revealed many of the issues related to Tony Kushner and his works.

And, therefore, in addition to "scholar" reasons I got also a great book full of real great, funny, moving and grand... talking... :-))) I'd really like to recomend it not only to people doing research in gay/queer/theater and performance in general topics, but also to those, who're seeking confessions of a lively and exploring mind.$LABEL$1,0,-100

just cheap screen house. pro : cheap, easy assembly, looks like waterproofcons : cheap material, some pole doesn't fit, big meshBefore this screen house, I got 14 by 12 screen house at Sams club by swissgear which was very good, well made and good price. I felt it was to big for us and returned it. The second one was by greatland at nearby target store. The quality was much poor than the swissgear's. Finally,I looked at the reviewes here and bought this one. I was happy about the cheap price. The pole looks likes steel which is easily get rust and some of them I cannot plug it in. I tried to bent them and manage to fit in. The screen mesh is lage compared to ordinary mesh of any tent. The roof material is same thing as a tarp and look like water proof which is good thing. The carring bag is big and nice. In my point of view, this is just a cheap screen house not better worthy than the money. You cannot expect quality of coleman or Eureka for sure.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Meh, it's not very good.... I played this game 2 years ago and found it to be quite disappointing. I was a massive fan of the first "Army Men" game that came out and that was definitely a very cool game. "Army Men: Air Attack" has arguably worse graphics than the first game and the gameplay is often problematic.It was cool to play a game with helicopters and army men, but the game is so short that you'll be done in less than a day if you play it non-stop. Look, the bottom line is that this game is just too short, too easy and is clearly based for younger kiddies, so I guess for a 16 or 18 year old this game is just a piece of piss.So get it for your kids if you like, but there are many newer, longer and more stimulating games out there, even for young ones. I guess that if I were a kid I'd give the game 7/10, but since I'm older I give it 3 stars. Just look elsewhere if you're above the age of 10, trust me...$LABEL$0,0,-100

Impractical for residential use. The woodpecker pro is a good device if you live in a rural area where screeching bird recordings won't bother the neighbors. If you use this in the city, be prepared to receive a noise citation from your local police department. And no, you can't turn it down low so it won't bother the neighbors and still have it be effective. City dwellers might as well put that same $200 towards hiring an exterminator or pest control pro. The majority of times it's a single woodpecker causing the damage, so it's not like you're going to need follow up visits by the pro. This is definitely a case of where being a DIY'er has no real benefit.$LABEL$0,0,-100

No SACD?. That's because Rhino is now owned by the WEA group and they don't support SACD. They could have used DVD-Audio instead, considering all the trouble they went to creating surround versions. The DTS 96/24 tracks are decent IF you have a newer 96/24 DTS decoder, otherwise you'll get 48/24 output. This same problem will plague the upcoming Genesis reissues as well, you'll only get the SACD layer if you buy the import and that means the videos will be PAL format.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not much substance. I bought this book hoping to get informed guidelines on handling emergencies involving children, while waiting for the ambulance - or even what to do or not in cases that might not merit a call to 911. However, the entire book could be summed up in one sentence: "Call 911 and sit tight." The author goes into all kinds of details, but I could not extract much in the way of emergency response, other than to sit by the child, reassure him/her and wait for the ambulance.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Hey, it's a freakin' toner cartridge, what can I say?. Well, the cartridge fit the laser printer, and it contains toner, and it works.

But if you have an NEC laser printer that uses this cartridge and it seems you're buying a lot of cartridges, maybe you should try this high capacity version.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not much use for someone who studied music. Looking for a book that might possibly give me a better insight into the aesthetic value of music, I bought this with high hopes. Having previously studied music, I was also hoping for a unique perspective and a broader education in classical music, but found this book to be nothing more than a college level textbook. It is arranged nicely and has great appendix on creating a music library. But the author is often long winded, using musical terms that aren't clearly defined and over descriptive and opinionated explanations of composers and their works. This might be nice for someone who has a beginning interest in classical music, but not for someone who has a working knowledge of the field.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Black light acoustic jams. Remember the sections of Black Sabbath's "Vol. 4" where the band would take a break from rocking and wander off on acoustic guitar tangents? Imagine a whole album of that, and you pretty much have Citay's debut. The album even has bongos, for chrissakes. But it's extremely well-done. Ezra Feinberg (formerly of Piano Magic) and Tim Green (of The F***ing Champs, and formerly of The Nation of Ulysses) combine on acoustic guitars, mandolin, and analog synths for some lava lamp-lit psychedelic folk. The only trace of Green's rocking resume is the occasional twin guitar harmony. Otherwise, this disc is full of pleasant vocals and gentle jams that your hippie uncle can get with.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Fabulous performance rendered mediocre by poor recording. This is a wonderful performance of Un Ballo, but, I tend not to watch it because the recording techniques were so poor. By that I mean that the lighting was always just a bit too low (making it difficult, at times, to appreciate the wonderful colonial costuming used for this American setting of the opera) and the sound recording levels are far lower than on another DVD of this opera I own (making it difficult, at times, to hear subtle passages). From an audio perspective, this DVD gives you no sense of presence. Everything's just a bit too murky.Though I prefer the look of the production of this Un Ballo to the Swedish setting and costuming in another Un Ballo DVD I own, I tend to watch the Swedish one just because it's so much easier to see and hear.Shame on the technicians. This might have been the best Un Ballo otherwise.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointment to Real MMC Fans. Four epsidoes from JUST season 6? I agree with most of these reviews in that Disney is just trying to jump on the Britney, Justin and Christina bandwagon. This is such a disappointment to those who watched, worked on, and truly loved the show. The real highlights of MMC were the other talented cast members, who were not featured. Dedicated fans know that Britney, Justin and Christina were never the most popular 'teers--why create a DVD just around them?On the plus side, this DVD features two of the better Season 6 skits--Generation Gap Shoppping and Everybody's a Winner (none of which include Brit, Justin or Christina). And, it has some good shots of 'teer siblings and friends like Trace, Jamie Lynn, Laura Lynn and Rachael (if this is interesting to anyone).This DVD will flop, and it deserves to. Disney needs to get their act together and create something that would embrace what the show really was--or not do anything at all.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Total Crap and that is Generous. I am sure this movie will appeal to spoiled brats who resent their parents and the establishment in this twisted immorality play. The film was playing when I was in college, and although I thought the poster looked neat, I never saw it. I realize now that it was garbage just like all those "Billy Jack" movies and the "One Tin Soldier" theme song. I saw the movie on Showtime recently and could not finish watching it. It was the kind of crap that only a liberal intellectual could love. I do own 2001 on Blue-Ray and appreciate that movie.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Blah... This may seem really stupid, but this CD definitely isn't within my decent genre range. Once in a while, there is a "pop-punk" song that makes everyone dance. I'm just writing this review because I'm searching for one of the songs from the trailer. I haven't even watched this movie, which could actually help me out, but I figured I could share my lack of musical knowledge with you nice folks. I'm wondering which song is played at the end of the preview where someone runs into a football pole, the goofy kid says "i thought it tasted funny", and what's his name is on stage playing the guitar. Some of the words are either "I'm contagious, you're contagious" or "I'm ok and you're ok". I'm guessing it's the second, though the first would be quite funny.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Don't you have to prove they're authentic?"Mapes: "Well, I think that's what critics of the story would say. I know more now than I did then and I think, I think they have not been proved to be false, yet."Ross: "Have they proved to be authentic though?

Acorn slippers - Great gift for my wife. My wife loves these slippers.For the last 10 years she's been purchasing or receiving LL Bean fleece slippers for Christmas and loved those.

You get what you pay for. This seems like a great deal. For $10 bucks more than the apple dock (standalone) you get a dock with ac adapter, a 3.5 mm to 3 RCA cable, an S video cable, a travel charger for the ipod (separate from the dock power supply), a remote, and a dock connector to 3 RCA cable (not dock connector to 2 RCA audio as advertised). Buying these components separately from quality manufacturers would cost over $100. The problem is that Cables to Go is not a quality manufacturer. The dock produced an audible hiss and reversed the audio signal, so that that the left speaker played what the right speaker was supposed to play and vice versa. Further, the remote was extremely shoddy, requiring multiple button presses and extremely accurate aiming even at a distance of 12 feet. I did not use any of the cables, but if they are anything like the dock I'd avoid them.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Low fat doesn't mean precarious...... I remember that these bad boys saved my life at a job I use to have. I would throw a couple of these Pop Tarts in the toaster and enjoy with a cup of coffee. I must say that they held me over very well until lunch time.Or under the assumption I didn't have time for lunch because my former job was known for not letting an easy going guy like myself have the ability to go to lunch, despite my high production and charismatic personality. I guess that is why I don't work there anymore.I digress, these Pop Tarts are really good and they don't taste low fat at all. The bold flavor of brown sugar and cinnamon burst from these Pop Tarts like a banshee's guffaws after Halloween is over. This treat is an exquisite pastry the can be served like beignets in The French Quarter.I will stop with the metaphors this really is a great product.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Moving Story. Lucy's story is a compelling one. Being faced with cancer at a young age is difficult. Being subjected to the treatments is difficult. Adding to that having your face changed in that manner and being able to work through it was a remarkable feat and took strength.It is a book that helps put many things in our life in perspective in both what we think are events and circumstances that are "too much" to handle when on reflection they are well within being nothing more than a minor annoyance and how we relate to and judge others. It also shows how strong people can be.The descriptions of what she went through and had to endure are detailed and disturbing and at times extremely unsettling. It still winds up as ultimately being a postive book, albeit sad.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Otis Sounds Like A Guest On His Own CD. I have almost all Otis Spann's CDs and this is my least favorite so far. When I buy an Otis Spann CD, I buy it because I want to hear amazing piano playing. Unfortunately, on this CD the piano is burried deep in the mix and covered by loud guitars, drums, etc. It's almost like Otis is a guest or backup on his own CD! In fact on many songs, other people are doing the vocals! I would say skip this CD. If you want Otis at his best, I would recommend Walkin' The Blues (the sound quality is excellent and has a few piano solo numbers), Bottom Of The Blues, and Best Of Vangaurd Years.$LABEL$0,0,-100
history, magic, journalism you cant get elsewhere. i would reccommend this book to anyone who enjoys travel narrative and is interested in magic and fortune tellers in asia. Although i can't agree with the author on all his opinions, as he seems to be against the modernization of Asia, i do agree that with the modernization there is a great loss of knowledge of nature. The author seems to have a love/hate thing going with china, doesn't seem to keen on thailand, and seems sad at the loss of how burma used to be. The book is well written and gives some great anecdotal history of asia, as well as illustrates, in part, the difference in the asian mindset when it comes to fortune tellers and magic.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Worst Camera Ever. In the beginning I was very excited to have a camera with 10 optical zoom. This was the reason I switched from the very reliable Cannon digital camera to the Panasonic. I have had this camera for 4 months. It takes fine pictures but other then the increased optical zoom I don't like it better then the 3 Cannons I have owned before. I bought this camera for a trip to Egypt. The camera worked the day before my trip and the first day of my tour it stopped working. It would turn on and off, on and off and then say turn off and then back on. All it would do is repeat this over and over. Needless to say I was not able to purchase another camera or have it fixed on my tour. I had to rely on disposible cameras and other people's photos.

Unlikable Characters.

Flawed. Just an example of how the author doesn't know what (s)he's talking about:"Probably the best-known technologies used by processors are Intel's Hyper-Threading and AMD's HyperTransport. Both allow each logical processor within the processor package to handle an individual thread in parallel with other threads being handled by other processors within the package."This is an elementary error, that even amateur hardware enthusiasts know is wrong. Hyper-Threading and HyperTransport are two very different things. The former is what the author describes, the latter is a bus. It suggests that the author doesn't know much about hardware, and probably created the book by googling and using sources that may, or may not be correct.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Two different albums, two different inspirations. To me it seems So Much For the City was all about being in love, not only with the brilliance of the California Coast but with a woman as well. The music, harmonies and general vibe of the album reflect this. The follow up album seems to dig more into the underbelly of the band and quite possibly the heartbreak of losing the woman. This is just a thought, I really have no knowledge of the singers relationships but I see clues throughout Lets Bottle Bohemia which suggest heartbreak, while the first album seems to emobdy the fire on new love. I also think the second has more of an East Coast, North East in particular vibe. It's not as sunny as the first but still very unique and packs a fist full of soul. I hope to catch them live someday.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Crummy design, poorly made. Disappointed.. Antennae piece snapped off in my hand first time I tried to extend it so I really have to question the workmanship. Cord runs through bottom of stand and makes the whole thing tip over VERY easily (which it did repeatedly even though we kept pushing the cord into the channel). Cord to plug it in is way too short in my opinion. Our tv is mounted above our fireplace and everything else we have reaches the outlet, this didn't. Reception was so-so.

Sailing through the eyes of a dingbat. This book was a total let down. I was hoping to gain some insight and information about what it is like to sail. I married into a sailing family and was hoping to be inspired by this book. Instead, the woman was a miserable sailor who couldn't even grasp the difference between port and starboard. She did not inspire woman to tackle such an adventure. Instead admits that she couldn't pull her weight and relied on her huband to do most tasks, even cooking breakfast on the boat.The book talks more about what leads up to them sailng like selling their house and quitting their jobs. And as the owner of two cats, I did not appreciate that the author "dumped" her cats because it was not convenient to cruise with them. Even though plenty of other people do this.So if you are loooking to get tips and advice on what it is like to cruise, don't buy this book.$LABEL$0,0,-100

So far it's awful. How can I keep reading into the centuries Ruiz, by default, knows more about when the opening pages contain so many howlers? Ruiz is a U.S.-born author who has swallowed the Black Legend of those atrocious Spaniards whole. "Alienation also included the Spanish assault on family kinship ties..." (p. 16) Then why does Mexico have the lowest divorce rate in the world? Whence its wealth of thirty million unassimilated Indians? (CIA Country Facts website.) How can he write of the two proud civilizations Mexicans embody when, in the same sentence, one was destroyed by the other?I'm a bleeding-heart CA liberal from Concord, MA, and I like facts. Regrettably, to teach in the UC system, one must stoke the soothing flames of ethnic rage even if it means making things up.$LABEL$0,0,-100
fascinating nightmares. I read this book many years ago when it was first published in paperback. I lost access to that copy and I am pleased that Nightmares has been reprinted. This is one of the most fascinating books that I have ever read. It is both thought-provoking and highly entertaining. The characterizations and settings are vivid. There are several long dreams, including one about competing cults that promise that either molybdenum or the magnetic pole will cure all ailments, and another about a resurgent Inca civilization dominating the earth. The nightmares are attributed to eminent persons of the 1950s' i.e., Dean Acheson's Nightmare, etc. You won't be able to put this one down.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Kind of dissapointed over all the hype. I was excited about getting this product after reading all the reviews and even my hair dresser said she loved it and would buy nothing else for herself.After the first few uses it was great but the longer I used it the dirtier my hair looked and felt.My hair did not feel clean and I know its not supposed to suds up so not sure if my mind was playing tricks on me or what but I did not care for it at all. I ended up giving it to my mother to try and see if maybe it was just me and havent heard if she likes or dislikes it.I think it would have been better for me if I would have alternated every other wash with this and maybe some actual shampoo.

In the name of Justice. Aukai Collins has written a brilliant novel which will teach the common lay reader or any reader ignorant of little (physical) Jihad, or Islam in general, just what this kind of fighting entails, and why it is waged. Collins exposes the disunity that can ruin any military expedition. He very clearly explains the motivation behind his decision to fight the Russians and others. His reasons for turning to the U.S. embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan, after having fought in Chechnya, are intriguing. As a fellow Muslim, I believe that Aukai is a true Mujahid; and you would do well to listen to him.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Kids love it and I love it because it doesn't make a mess. I use this in speech therapy session with little ones. I like it because I don't have to stick my hands inside to get the wand.

Not a Game for the Small Investor. This book talks about the various factors affecting multi-million-dollar developments. The misleading pictures of Monopoly houses on the cover suggest small-scale residential investing, but the properties under discussion are the size of an entire Boardwalk. Frankly, the whole "game" analogy may sound like fun, but is nothing more than representing economic forces, e.g. the cost to borrow money, as "cards" one draws. Ho hum. If you don't have millionaire investors as friends or a job doing due dilligence for huge developments like shopping centers, warehouses, etc., this scale of this book is much too grand.

good story-filled with spelling and grammar errors. I liked the story , but it was filled with so many grammar and spelling errors that it was hard to keep track of the story. Words were missing especially the small words that complete a sentence. It was like having to read between the lines to understand the story. I used to do this when I was younger when I wrote letters to my grandmother. She always told me that my mind was working faster than my writing. She had to fill in the blanks to know what I was writing. A letter is short compared to a book. This should have been proofed more closely.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Nasty, Hurtful, and Unsocial. I listened to this tape and tried to keep an open mind, hoping it would get better, even though I felt like turning it off a few times. Ms Martinet seems to have a lot of deep, nasty, resentful feelings towards people. Has she been treated badly by a crowd of strangers at one too many cocktail parties? Her advice in dealing with others is to make your self feel superior by putting down everyone else.

Works very well. Like most kids, my children love stickers. I selected this product to create custom stickers, hoping that the stickers could also be removed easily. I am happy to report that this paper appears to work as described. I had no problems printing to this paper and then sticking and un-sticking the creations.Avery has some suggested crafts on its website, but nothing appealing to my children. But there are many ideas on the web. Another possibility is to let them design something on the computer or on paper and then scan it and print it out. I can imagine many other uses for this sticker paper. If they were less expensive, I would use them with my Amazon seller account and just print, stick, and ship. They would also make excellent labels for homebrewing.It would be nice to have a choice of colors, glossy and luster finishes, and finer scoring on the back for smaller stickers. I just wish there were more sheets in the pack!$LABEL$1,0,-100

A beautiful and important book. Ariel Dorfman is one of the most important writers of our time, and Desert Memories, Journeys Through the Chilean North serves as a testament (and a coda) to the terrible years that began with the military overthrow of President Allende's democratically-elected government in 1973, the repression and horror that followed, the exile of so many who barely survived, such as Dorfman. His car trip through the Chilean North with his wife, Angelica, so many years later, is at once a reflection on those events as he visits concentration camps, clandestine graves, the family of a good friend who was "disappeared" by Pinochet's army, along with an evocation of the beauty of the desert landscape and its earlier, hidden history.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great Read. It has been awhile since I have read a book that captured me as much as this one did. Once I read Furies of Calderon, I had to continue immediately on to Academ's Fury, and plan on reading Cursor's Fury next.

A Sea of White Impatiens was better. I wanted to like this book because I really enjoyed A Sea of White Impatiens. Having grown up in the same town as the Gallaghers, I enjoyed all the references to the people from "Roweneck". The main character (or the author's voice) came across as ignorant sometimes and I was getting tired of the arrogant tone.

"Intelligent Design" propaganda. This documentary is produced by the fundamentalist christian movement whose agenda it is to get Darwin's theory of evolution banned from schools and have it replaced by "Intelligent Design", which really just means creation, as put forth in the bible. As can be expected from a documentary with an agenda to convince the viewer of a certain point, rather than being open minded, it does not really go anywhere. It keeps repeating the point that "scientists agree" that life could not have developed anywhere else in the universe.The other reviewers here must be people associated with "the cause," this really is not a five star production simply because instead of sincerely investigating the subject with an open mind you get science, contorted to fit religion.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Farting, drinking, getting punched and getting laid. Although well-written enough to want you to turn the page for potential adventure, it never comes. Jaime talks about guy bonding via farting, drinking and getting laid while in town. The book never gets exciting to the point of combat, and that's the purpose of the French Foreign Legion. Why didn't Jaime just enlist in the US army for a tour or two or three to Iraq or Afghanistan? I'm sure he could have come back with excitement, gore and extreme physical and mental challenges to last a life time. I got the impression Jaime just joined the Legion to see if he could pass basic training, and then to write about it later. I read the first 150 pages but got bored and quit...just like Jaime.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Unapologetically Sexual Nightmare. Make no mistake, this book is unabashed terror porn, with rife, vividly cruel sexuality. It's explicit in terms of both sex and scenes of unimaginable violence, sort of like what "My Life at Rose Red" would be like if it were reimagined by Larry Flynt and Marilyn Manson. Edward Lee's work has appeared in famous horror anthologies including the "Hot Blood" series.If you realise, however, what you are getting into, this book is well-written and a capitvating read.

Simple to use.. I bought this hard drive to store music, movies, etc. I've had it almost two weeks, and here are my impressions so far:Pros: Easy to hook up, plug and play for XP, the stand that comes with it is very sturdy, the hard drive itself feels solid, simple design.Cons: Blue LED on the front is to bright, usable space on the drive only reads as 150 GB, the power brick that comes with the drive is fairly large.Overall, this is a good hard drive for the money. Besides a few design quirks it has, I'd recomend this drive to anyone looking for a inexpensive external HD.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great Album, But Flat Production Sound. Like others who have reviewed this album, I agree that it is the best (maybe second best to Rainbow Rising) work that Rainbow ever did. However, since the late 70s, when I initially purchased it, I have always been bothered by the "flat" production sound. The bass and drum sound have no punch. Amazingly, it was produced by Martin Birch, who would later go on to doing great things with Iron Maiden. That's my only complaint. With a better production, this album would be unbelievably good$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not for young jwomen. I've read reviews and thought that Mariue Claire would be better than Cosmo (it's all about sex in Cosmo) but I'm dissapointed. Marie claire is like in style the whole magazine is just a photos of models and advertisments. There are maybe 2 or 3 articles but they are not so interesting.

You'll need to either get lucky or keep on returning copies. It's really great to have these films together in what is (visually, anyhow) a very handsome package. On the other hand, as others have complained before me, the reality of the packaging is that the disks break from their cheap clear plastic holding tabs, get scratched, and become unplayable. I've had to return two copies of the FRANKENSTEIN and three of DRACULA before I found acceptable copies.The films themselves are fine and look great, but when the disk freezes or simply refuses to play a film, we're talking significant problems.I also cringe at the advertising aspect of these films (does the director of Van Helsing have anything to tell us about FRANKENSTEIN? Does he even belong on the same disk as horror film historian, David Skal. Nope on both counts.To my mind, these films should be repackaged and customers offered a free upgrade. This is inexcusable hack packaging from a major studio's whose past work has been stellar.$LABEL$0,0,-100
feeder falls apart...be warned!. I didn't buy our mesh feeder from here, but did want to write a review somewhere to warn other parents. The pin in the hinge falls out after a few months of use, at least. I kept trying to jam it back in and it kept falling apart as our child used it. I turned around 2 days ago and he had the pin and both pieces of the feeder in his hands. The pin is a plastic long piece that could cause a choking hazard. Be warned to not buy this particular feeder. I am trying to find the company's website to write to them about the issues.

Not good enough. They might sound bad to me because I am used to Audiophile headphones. But they don't sound terrible. Nice clean highs, but the bass is a little muddy. Maybe it will clear up in time as they burn in, but for the price... I especially like the volume control and headphone input. It works excellent and matches my system. But these speakers are great for the price. If I spent 100 on them I would be mad with the sound quality, but for less than 30, they are excellent. I just picked up a new pair of speakers which sound way better than these and they were cheaper too. Check out my other reviews on which speakers I got. These will be sitting in my closet for a backup pair, not worth sending them back.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Always something happenning. I found Darkfall to be very enjoyable. If this had been the first Dean Koontz (DK) book that I had read then I would definitely have given it a 5 star rating but having read most of DK's books, I gave it 4 stars. I reduced the rating knowing that he has written better work but it is still a very good read. The story is non stop action so gets you in quickly. It may be unrealistic but it is never boring. He has the most amazing imagination and style of writing. When I read his books, I can picture all he writes and feel the emotion and tension. It's like having a movie playing in my head. Darkfall didn't let me down at all. I loved the suspense in the chase and the bit of romance.The authors note was also interesting.Don't hesitate. Buy the book. You wont be sorry.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Disappointed. Do not be fooled by the description of this book. It is very much a book only about African American history. If you were looking for something more middle of the road that shows the flaws that our kids learn in history class these days, this book is not for you. It doesn't exactly "set the record straight". It merely amplifies what we are forced to hear about everyday. Overall a disappointing read for me.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Does not live up to its purpose. Although this book is for beginners, it is very problematic. I think the publishing company farmed this project out to a developer without telling this person that the book was for beginners. The book starts out with a good primer of object oriented principles but then jumps into advanced stuff such as creating listeners. It does not lay out the lesson plans well the little cartoon graphics are supremely annoying. Other books in this series have been pretty helpful but this one is a bit of a disaster.

Not so hot, badly worded questions. This book tries to be an "exam cram" but ends up being a badly abridged version of the massive Training Guide (ISBN 0789728222). There are page-consuming examples that don't add much, and yet key facts are missing. These facts do surface in the Exam Prep Questions, which at least informs the reader that they need to go research that topic, but those points should appear in the text. Questions are often badly worded; their intent is only explained by reading the answers.The authors should consider a re-write. Cut useless examples. Include code snippets with the minimum required context instead of the full "Create a new solution, add a page named blah, add these 5 controls..." Tighten up the prose; make it clear and concise for easy review. Cut the fluff, not the facts.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Simply Hypnotic. The guitarist in my old band once shared the best suggestion with me. To listen to American Fooball. I am forever in his debt- for this alone. This album by American Football is one of the most remarkable things that I have ever heard. These songs are completely emotional, and stunningly heartbreaking. When I first heard it, I instantly grew to love it. I wanted to hear it constantly. I began playing it over and over and it never left my CD player for months on end. The beautiful guitar work, the extremely talented drumming, the soft spoken lyrics, and the pure comfort of this recording made me an instant fan. I was horrified to hear that they had dismembered, even before the record was put out. But I strongly urge everyone to listen and purchase this album. Unfortunately, this music is too impresive for words. You seriously must experience it first hand- and you won't be disappointed.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Absolutely Terrible. After only about three months of use this has already broken down on me. It won't hold a charge anymore. I hope Homedics is aware of all these bad reviews of their product. This product is simply not made to withstand a typical bathroom environment. The housing is made such that water and toothpast will seep in no matter how you use it. The brushhead will stop working in about a months worth of use as the combined water and grime will stop it from working. Did they even test this thing themselves? What were they thinking......... A bathroom product that is not waterproof and is intended to be used near water is just mind boggling. Brushing with it was okay, but the quality and design of the product leave MUCH to be desired.

Love, Love, Love - You need this.. This product is so fantastic I have bought three of them, one for each room my daughter may fall asleep in. We have the pink ladybug, the red ladybug and the twilight turtle. The stars are so sweet to look at and provide a nice nightlight for the little ones. it's really cool that the stars actually show constellations and the story book that comes with the package is fun.The auto turn off feature is great and seems to be the perfect amount of time for my daughter to fall asleep. It's small enough to be portable (we schlep it to grandma's house regularly) but a good size for kids to cuddle with too. Some of our friends came over with their kids, who are a couple years older than ours, and flipped when they found the ladybug. This is great for infants all the way to pre-teens. Heck, even my husband and I will put one in our room some nights because it's so fun to look at.I highly recommend this. You need it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Is NOT leak proof. I too bought one of these lunch bowls at Target and I can confirm that it indeed is not leak proof. My son started school and wanted soup. When I picked him up the teacher informed me that his soup leaked all over his lunch bag and book bag, making his folder and books all wet! There is a small hole in the slot where the take along spoon is (I assume for ventilation) and when I ran water on the underside of the lid I confirmed that it leaked through this hole. It also only does a marginal job of keeping food hot. When we sent spaghetti or pierogies they were only room temp come lunch time. Again I assume this is because of the small hole in the lid.$LABEL$0,0,-100

"We are not your doctor or dentist if you want to know what it is, you need to contact them"......I contacted my dentist who advised that this was sloughing cells from the lining of my mouth, and that this was a common allergic/ sensitivity reaction to chemicals in mouth care products.He suggested that stopping using Listerine Whitening Pre-Brush Rinse would be the right thing to do.One star to the product, and ZERO stars to Listerine/Pfizer for not having the guts to tell me that this was not normal and was cells sloughing off the inside of my mouth.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Dumbest movie in years.. Is this supposed to be art? Because it has no other value, other than perhaps for the purpose of studying the effects of boredom on the human psyche. I kept expecting the main character to be a hero, instead he's just a loser. I can appreciate a movie without a hero (i.e. Being John Malkovich) but can't they at least make the loser character someone who does something...anything...interesting?Also, the other characters are really weak. The best potential characters, the grandma for example, are barely ever on screen.I thought this movie would be like Rushmore, and I couldn't have been more wrong.I will say one thing positive about it, though, there is a scene where Napolean goes to jump his bike on a ramp and instead just plows through it - a really funny gag, I have to admit...most of us have done something like that.In summary, might be worth it if you can rent it cheap and get a backup movie, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A Major Disappointment. Neil Finn is without doubt one of the best songwriters of this era. With Crowded House his tunes were mixed with ever more innovativness reaching a pinnacle with Together Alone, among the best albums of the last decade. Try Whistling This sadly shows that he needs a tight unit to breathe life and energy into his songs. There are exactly two outstanding tracks on this release, the catchy summer tune She Will Have Her Way and the spooky Sinner. Most of the rest lacks the spark that Crowded House seemed to produce in their sleep. A few tracks are even hardly b-side material. Neil obviously needs a group of musicians around him, not session players, to highlight his own talents.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Good-story wanna-be. Eliza Blake is a beautiful news anchorwoman who enters your home, and the homes of thousands just like you, every day. For some, this isn't enough. Eliza has multiple "stalkers" sending her sick messages in the mail and on her phone. She and her five year old daughter are being threatened and it must end, before someone ELSE dies.This had the makings of a really great story. In my opinion, it just didn't say all it should have. The main character, Eliza, should have done everything in her power to protect herself and her daughter. She really didn't do squat. She simply stood back, making observations. The writing was very predictable and matter-of-fact; I felt no suspense or any other emotions, for that matter. The dialog was very dull and rigid, like the words were simply pulled from a dictionary. I yelled at the book a couple times. You'll need a little patience with this one.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A great read. This book is exciting and captivating. It captures the challenges of Military life starting in boot camp and progressing on through the war in Viet Nam. I've read the book twice, once a long time ago and then again recently. I feel like I know the author personally. He bares his heart and soul in this book. It's written in present tense as if the scenes had been accurately recorded. I don't know how the author could do that so well, he must have a detailed journal or a photographic memory (or maybe both).

I bought it as a less expensive option than coaching school, not to read a list of schools!The "book" is a great list of schools that have easy-to-find websites. The list compiler probably spent a full day or two on www.google.com to find, block, cut and paste this "book."The title is very deceptive!On the flip side though, $12.95 + S&H is not a bad price for a reminder that the world is filled with unscrupulous folks! From this perspective the book was well worth every penny!Perhaps the author could next compile a list of porn sites, call it a book and title it "How to Have a Loving Relationship."$LABEL$0,0,-100
a nice departure from Radiohead. I will start off by saying that this solo album from radiohead frontman Thom Yorke will not have mass appeal . This album is almost entirely electronic , and minimalistic in it's approach . Sufficed to say , it is destined to alienate the casual listener . However , if you enjoy lush , ambient electro-soundscapes with emotive vocals ( and you are not a card carrying member of the A.D.D. generation ) then you may like this very intimate and personal album . Essentially , this is a stripped-down Radiohead . Thom Yorke seems to have a re-newed sense of purpose , he isn't just going through the motions like on previous -RH- albums . This is his most inspired work in years .$LABEL$1,0,-100
great third album. I don't really need to tell anyone who has heard BHC to check this album out because they are probably listening to it right now just as I am......if you haven't heard boy hits car they can be (roughly) compared to bands like system of a down, tool, rage, nonpoint, pulse ultra ... this is a great album, favorite song right now is All the Love We Hold InsideGET THIS ALBUM!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not even close. I wear a size 13 or 14 depending on the manufacturer. This shoe stretcher wouldn't even touch the sides on my size 13 Rockports. They were a little tight, so I wanted to loosen them up.It was ridiculous how far from "stretching" they were. I would guess there was at least a half inch of space in the shoes when the "stretchers" AND the little knobs were fully extended. Without the knobs it probably would have been an inch. I mean they say up to size 14, but I would be shocked if they could stretch my wife's shoes. I'm returning them because they wouldn't even be useful for her.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Wonderful. My class was recently assigned this book to read to go along with our unit on Africa. Cry, The Beloved Country was filled with extrodinary passages that made me feel the pain and suffering of a country under a time of great turmoil.

It's rare for a teen title to be so well crafted and the dialogue so adult and inviting.. This was really interesting and intelligent book, aside from the many misnomers about my home state of Washington, and some issues that were not fully developed like Bella's attraction of danger and near death experiences hopefully the next two installments will explore these issues. I loved this book despite of those flaws and I am anxious to engage in one of the sequels. It's rare for a teen title to be so well crafted and the dialogue so adult and inviting. I think the size and subject matter will put off some teens but those that pick it up will not be able to put it down, nor will they be able to stop wondering what will be come of Bella in the next book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good book for our times.. This book could be seen by some as an allegory of modern conservative-Republicanism run amok. A CEO traffics in human cargo and destroys indigenous tribal cultures to provide cheap labor for his company and protect against corporate espionage. The haves (Salts, Teavees, Gloops, etc.) all grow wealthier, fatter and more demanding at the expense of the hardworking have-nots (the Buckets.) Overweight children, kids with ADHD and post-feminist loud-mouths are skewered, while the child who keeps his mouth shut and plays by the rules of corporate culture is the ultimate winner.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Get ready to yawn.. This is a mediocre movie pumped to 5 stars by blatant sock-puppetry. I rarely see an Amazon DVD with 5 stars and over 100 reviews. On that basis alone I purchased _A Dog's Breakfast_. Mistake.At first I thought what I was seeing here were a contingent of vocal Stargate fans, too besotted with their favorite actors appearing in a non-genre venue to see its limitations.After further reflection, it's pretty clear to me that most of the reviews were written by one or two people. Read a dozen of the 5 star reviews and you'll begin to hear the same screechy voice coming out of the mouths of nearly one hundred sock puppets.This is not a good movie.Don't get me wrong--it isn't a terrible movie either. But the capable acting doesn't save this tepid comedy from a poorly structured plot and lackadaisical pacing. I snickered a few times but was otherwise bored throughout.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Buyer Beware: SERIOUS Quality Control Issues!!. We hated, hated, HATED this thing...'cause despite purchasing THREE of them, we never really got to play with one! Even though it IS cute, plays fun music, and appears to have the potential to be a lot of fun, we actually purchased THREE seperate Twirlin' Whirlin' Gardens three seperate times, and EVERY SINGLE time we got one home and took it out of the box, it was broken!! One time we had one of the little belts inside break (this is similar to a vaccuum cleaner), another time the little plastic gears inside were broken, etc. Makes me wonder if there's any quality control at Fisher-Price at ALL, since many other people seem to have had a lot of fun and success with this thing. We had no such luck! So, my caution to the world is this: be careful buying this thing. I find it hard to believe that we would have gotten THREE bad eggs just by chance.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Marketing is the devil. As a child I loved these books. They were exciting but in a safe way and they really told a great story of a young girl finding a place where she is loved. However, that place was not in a pile of hay with farmer Jed. Let's stop the stupidity and actually make covers that work. It isn't like people haven't heard of the books before. I know you have to market to the weakest link, but I really don't think that someone who had never heard of the books would be happy with the story based on the cover. As someone who did like the books, I would be embarrassed to be seen reading this version in public. If you want to be lazy, just take a picture of a farm house or a field and put that on the cover.

Very difficult to program, poor performance. The beeping part comes with a plastic stick and an array of buttons to program. You have to be a genius/scientist to get it all figured out.

Duh, which way did he go, George? Which way, which way???. As far as I'm concerned, everything after "Contra La Corriente" has been a disappointment. That CD had it all: erotic as well as sublime love lyrics. His self titled album left me stunned with how pedestrian and stupefyingly bland it was. I expected something much more sophisticated, I mean - this is Marc Anthony. I love Marc's voice and talent, and I understand he wants to try different styles but it's confusing to fans and eventually dilutes his fan base. He should stick to what he does well while learning to write music. Learning an instrument (guitar? piano? a la Alejandro Sanz) wouldn't hurt either.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Water proof is the only good thing -. The Olympus 720SW is great for in water shots and movies - surfing, snorkeling and boating. However, the good things end there. The camera (7.1MP) takes poor images for your average (out of water) shot. The shots are blurry and it is hard to find the proper settings in each condition. The Xd card is super slow, takes several seconds before the camera is ready to shoot again. My suggestion buy the canon elf and just take the extra time to put it in a waterproof housing. My 4MP canon elf takes a much better quality image. I will not buy another Olympus product, my next camera will be the 7.1MP canon elf.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Old information, precedes Sarbanes Oxley. Not only is this an infomercial for CCBN, the investor relations website vendor, but the information is now very out of date. The book was written at a time when CCBN's advice was that a corporate governance section on your IR website consisted of a list of your directors with little or no biographic detail, and a list of company managers with perhaps a short bio on each. We have come a long way since then, and so has CCBN, but this book, like many to do with the fast changing Internet, is now stale.

From Zero to Unfortunately, Duality. When I first heard Ra's "From Zero" I was in awe. A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me. Then, Duality came out.Duality demonstrates a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra. I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they devoled. They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct. I just wish they went in a different direction.I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken.

Blaming a group for the troubles of a nation is not nationalism: it divides a country.The problem I have with this book is not that it is indoctrinating - as suggested - but that it ingrains in children an unhealthy sense of political antagonism.A conservative viewpoint should be taught in a more moderate way, explaining the reasons and the benefits. Otherwise, the opinion seems to radical and in early adolescence, the child may rebel entirely in the opposite direction.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Dickensian. Dalrymple's argument is essentially that the poor have made many stupid choices, and that the rest of us therefore owe them nothing.Of course some people make bad choices; this is obvious. But Dalrymple's diagnosis of the problems of the lower class are based on his experiences with convicted criminals and with psychiatric patients. What kind of book would he have produced if he had worked with white-collar criminals and patients at a celebrity rehab center?Dalrymple's brand of concern was parodied well by Charles Dickens in Hard Times: a wish that the poor would simply stop being poor. Does it all come down to the individual? Well-written, but as cruel as any other social darwinist tract.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Clever, overrated, but you need to read it!. The Dark Knight Returns is a Batman story, to be sure: dark, edgy, full of gadgets, villains, and of course, Robin.There are interesting storytelling techniques, most mentionable is the use of a television newscast to tell much of the story. Clever, I thought.But.. this comic is overrated. Not that it's not a good story, and well presented in all the visuals, but it's not to par with all the critic's talk. The story being written in the eighties must be taken into account, so the plot twists and other references don't really hit today's audience.This is, however, a must-have addition to any serious graphic novel enthusiast, Batman fan, or aspiring artist. The reference value alone makes it worth the read, if not the buy.-The GlowWormP.S. A good animated version of some of the events is in the new Batman animated series in an episode called "Legends of the Dark Knight," I believe. Check it out.$LABEL$1,0,-100

It seems like all these stipper stories are always the same.. This book is too expensive for the contents. The book covers why women strip in clubs, then it goes on through many chapters of explanations, but in the end it tells us that it's because they make good money and fast. The book goes on to explain a strippers percetion of her job, then it goes on to tell us that strippers go through greatlengths to justify what they do and how they blame society, x-relationships, family and others, but never themselves. The book goes through many interviews, all of which are very much common and related. A good girl strips to finance her education, to support her children after her man leaves her or to support a drug habit. Or the most common, but not admitted, just for the money. This good is well written, but the story about all these stippers are all the same in this book and on every television review or movie. I wish this book would have covered something new, useful or insightful.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Ingersoll-Rand website doesn't match documentation. After much research, and reading everyone's reviews, I purchased the IR 2130. I opted for the 2130 over the 2132 because based on information on Amazon and Ingersoll-Rand corporate website, it appeared the specs for two were very closely matched, and I couldn't justify spending the extra money. However, to my surprise, when I received the 2130 today and actually read the owner's manual, it states the recommended FWD torque range is 25 to 350 ft.lbs. However, the corporate website shows the FWD torque range is 50 to 500 ft.lbs. So what's the real value? And why such a huge difference between the website information, and the actual owner's manual? I expected a little better consistency from IR's communication.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I Challenge Yes To Put Out A New Album As Great As This. I am so sick and tired of people criticizing Steve Howe's vocals!Sure, when this album first came out in 1975, it took me a little while to get used to the vocals. Steve Howe does have an unusual voice. And I was only sixteen at the time.But I have long since come to appreciate this album and Steve Howe's vocals on it. In fact, I think his voice is haunting. And the song writing on this album is brilliant.I would much rather hear Steve Howe sing the sophisticated music that appears on this album than hear Jon Anderson sing the primitive music that appears on recent Yes albums such as "Magnification".$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not really that funny or entertaining.... I really expected this to be gutbustingly funny, but it's not. Given that "travel lessons learned too late," is included in the title, it is reasonable to assume that this is just misadventures, and it certainly is that. But the fact is, rather than coming across as something humourous, I just feel like Ayun Halliday is whining incessantly. This is partly due to the fact that she seems to get herself into trouble where just an ounce of common sense would have made things better...then again, that would have inevitably made this book nonexistent.That's not saying that there is nothing interesting or funny in this book. The monkey breaking into their residence in India was pretty funny, as was their misery in Romania. But other than that, I expected a lot more out of this. It just drags on, and on, with any bit of humour being sprinkled about like tiny grains of salt.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Problems with network. Although SUSE 9.2 appears to be a well designed product with many useful features, I'm unable to get it to function as a DHCP client on my network, so I can't get onto the Internet or access any local network resources. There is perhaps some subtle tweak here that might get it to work but after spending an hour on the telephone with one of SUSE's support staff neither he nor I was able to find it.After reviewing some of the posts on various Linux forums, networking problems appear to be common with this release.

Points, good price, work great, one problem.. the points, condensor, flywheel key, and spark plug are great! Gapped to .020 and it fired right up. I paid $15 for these parts separately at O'Reilly's.

An excellent read. I am writing this review one week after completing the Barcelona marathon-thanks to The Non-Runner's marathon trainer. Before reading this book, the most I had ever run was 10 miles-I was not a regular runner.The training programme outlined in the book is credible and realistic, the authors also focus on the mental preparation-which I found to be just as important (if not more) as the physical training. I cannot recommend this book enough, if you want to run a marathon and don't know where to start-then this book is what you're looking for! After finishing my first marathon (I plan to do more now) I feel I can do almost anything, the experience was second to none!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Ah yes, The Blue Max. Who has'nt seen the classic movie starring George Peppard(a fellow Michigan boy)? So you've got to read the book too! However, it is much different than the movie. In the book Bruno Shtachel is an alcholic for one thing, and most of his problems stem from that. I had to look long and hard to find a copy of this book and when I did I was suprised to find how different it was from the movie. Actually I would say that the movie is better but I would still highly recommend the book. It was finally reprinted again in 1996 in limited quantities so is more easily available.

At least they spelled "God" correctly. This finale also kept me turning the pages right to the very end. The book ties up most of the threads of the story at the end in a deft convergence of a bunch of story lines. In fact, approaching the last pages, you begin to wonder how any of these can be resolved by the end. Most of them are, but, as pointed out by others, a couple of the story lines are left hanging. Although I've enjoyed the series greatly, one thing kept jarring me all the way through: Why does every human in the known universe speak in British idioms like "bloody"? This definitely makes this an "alternate universe" story; it's not "bloody likely" in our universe! The other quibble is that I have never seen a published volume with such a multitude of typographical errors. The proofreaders must have been on holiday during the production.

Not a good resource. I have used quite a few "Intro to" books to learn various applications, and this one is at the bottom of the list. Granted, some of this may be due to the fact that I'm not overly enamored with QuarkXPress itself, but this book does it no favors. Information is not organized well,and the index isn't helpful.In short, the book doesn't do a good job of teaching Quark as a whole, AND if you are looking for help on a particular topic, its almost impossible to find.

No zzzzzzzs in this Z. This movie, which is based on a true story, is a political thriller set in Greece. The chief of an opposition (left wing) political group is killed by hired thugs - with the police doing the hiring and controlling the massive cover up. A newspaper photographer begins unravelling the corruption and putting the pieces together. In reality, the scandal was so bad it brought Pampidou to power. It's a very fast-paced and taut drama. But the movie seems caught between presenting the factual record faithfully and creating a film mystery: we know what's going on while the movie keeps trying to keep us in the dark.

How can anyone like these guys?. Sorry, but it is impossible to comprehend why anyone would like this music. Even the Amazon editor calls it "bile". The lead singer? Well... he doesn't sing. Period. That's the main problem with this band, the other being that the songwriting is horrible. There's good punk rock, like The Clash and The Ramones, but then there's this. On top of that, we can thank this cruddy band for inspiring hundreds of musically untalented snubs to try their hand at punk rock, ultimately killing rock n' roll and good rock in general. And these guys got inducted into the Hall of Fame? Pathetic! When the Sex Pistols never gave authority respect, why should authority give any to them?$LABEL$0,0,-100
One of my favourite!. Aren't we all secretly hoping that there really is a match made in heaven out there somewhere just waiting for us? And that there are forces at work trying to get us together with the right person? Well, that's exactly what I believe, and I'm so glad Nora Ephron makes films that help our faith along, just like the books by Johanna Spyri ("Heidi") or Lucy M. Montgomery ("Anne of Green Gables"). Why don't we finally begin listening to the voices in our hearts instead of smothering them in all the turbulence the world offers us today?This film is refreshing, heart-warming and wonderful. I can recommend it to anyone that needs rejuvenation. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are both wonderful actors, and I have immensely enjoyed the films I have seen with them. This one is no exception. Applause also for Ross Malinger and Gaby Hoffmann for their roles as Jonah and Jessica. If you enjoy romantic comedies, this one shouldn't be missing from your collection.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Propaganda and lies from the daughter of a traitor.. The first thing to look for when you want to read a book is the credibility of the author. And unfortunatly in this case the author has no credibility. Malika Oufkir had without a doubt been traumatised by her experience to a great extent. She portrays herself as a victim and tries to get the sympathy of the reader. I was born and raised in Morocco and familiar with the story of this family. The author omits to mention in her book who her father really was. General Oufkir tried to overthrow the head of the moroccan government but his attempt failed. ....$LABEL$0,0,-100

5 star album; 3 star remaster. I was delighted when, finally, Nilsson Schmilsson was finally getting the "deluxe" release treatment. I'd paid big bucks for the import in the late 90s, and that was such a disappointment, sonically.Well, despite reviews to the contrary, the sonics on this release are not much better, and do not hold a candle to the original LP. My old LP may have a few pops, but it blows this CD release away, sonically. I don't know how that can be, but believe me, it's trueThis, along with Son Of Schmilsson, is a truly classic pop/rock album. Maybe someday they'll do it right.

" Includes Everything You Need" - what a crock!!. It clearly says right on the box "Includes Everything You Need". That would indicate to me (and most people) that besides the cake and possibly icing - everything you need is included in the box. This is incorrect. You are expected to purchase dowels and do drilling! in order for this cake to stand up. Very disapppointing! Wilton should be ashamed of itself. Maybe this is good for a professional cake decorator who already has these types of materials and has possibly done something like this, but for the rest of us - not good.

A pleasure!. As a dancer,I think this film may appeal mainly to those who are dancers/performers themselves, or those who have already seen Zumanity. Lots of backstage intrigue and enough scenes of the show itself to be titillating and encourage you to hop a plane to Vegas. Touching and often very funny as well- not an artistic triumph, but it more than held my interest. Wish they had more footage of Wassa and a little less of Miss Jonel's whip! The performers are absolutely spectacular and deserve full marks for their courage in doing what they do in Zumanity: present a vision of sexuality that is more...well,.. HUMAN, than the other banal, cliched and cartoonlike erotic shows in Vegas, or anywhere else for that matter. Spymonkey rules!!!$LABEL$1,0,-100

A terrible company. I would at all costs stay away from any product made by Phillips. I bought a dvd/vcr combo, it broke, I shipped it to them for repair, they charged me shipping and then sent back another broken unit. They then refused to take it back at their expense, even though they had shipped a broken unit (The first time the dvd didn't work, the unit they shipped to me had a defective vcr). Their customer service people have no authority to help you, and neither does their management. Repeated attempts to move up the ladder were ignored (i.e. being constantly told they weren't available, they never returned phone calls even after telling me they would, etc.).

The Title Fits Them Perfectly!. Ice Cube went solo & had a successful career. Even though some of his songs were pretty harsh language wise, Cube always told a story, painted a picture of a young misinformed Blackman from the ghetto. Cube gave you the negative but balanced it with the positive. Cube's counterparts NWA completely fell into the bottomless pit of ignorance & couldn't recover. NWA's so called "street knowledge" in reality was "street nonsense." Without Cube writing the lyrics, NWA relies on ignorant word play & the most worst display of misogyny I have ever heard. There is nothing landmark about this cd, NOTHING! If I could have given this trash a zero I would.

If you really like 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' chances are this disc will be a disappointment. Listen to sound samples before buying! Compared to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' this CD was a big let down. Gone are the collages of movie audio samples placed over dark soundscapes (although a few short 'filler' tracks reflect this style). 'Hope & Sorrow' focuses more on guest vocalist and rappers and most of the tracks fail to impress. This seems to be an attempt at more of a commercial 'dance' release than the well crafted Turntablism record that I was expecting. I 'hoped' this disc would be an excellent follow up to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' but all I felt was 'sorrow' upon my first listen. A disappointment.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Vocals Are Cheap. Richards writes pretty hooky rock music and uses the same sort of clichéd lyrics that brought the Stones greatness, but Mick Jagger, he ain't. To put it another way, he can't sing. Indeed, his vocals are so tentative and mixed so badly back that it's possible to believe there is no singer (maybe this was the engineer's intention). It seems clear that without Mick there would be no Keith, on the other hand, if one listens to Jagger's solo efforts one could equally convinced that the opposite is true.

An enthusiastically recommended, thought-provoking cross-examination of modern society.. The Way of Ignorance and Other Essays is an anthology of writings by cultural critic Wendell Berry - one of Smithsonian magazine's 35 People Who Made a Difference - about topics ranging from what freedom is really being discussed when one speaks of "free market" or "free enterprise", to the costs of so-called rugged individualism in a democratic commonwealth, to sharp-laced observations on the Kerry campaign, and much more. Written in plain terms, The Way of Ignorance takes a cold, hard look at the doubletalk and doublethink that saturates modern American airwaves, stripping them down to bare conundrums, all with a heavy dose of the author's practical evaluation.

Eagerly Awaiting the Sequel. This was the first book I have read by either Eric Flint or K.D. Wentworth and I must say that I was hooked from the beginning. The concept seemed fresh to be, man meets alien conquerors and fails to defeat them. This does not conform to the normal style of military sci-fi that I read. There isn't a whole lot of action, there is some and it is well written. The real catch of the book though is the characters. The Jao are an extremely well thought out race of aliens. They are different enough to not be human but similar enough that they are can be reasoned with to a degree. The aliens have their own culture/society that dosn't always mesh well with human culture/society. Aille, the storys main character, grows and learns from his time on Earth and the people that he associates with. I highly recommend this book to any sci-fi fan and I can't wait till the sequel is released.One more thing, the space battle in the sun's photosphere is super cool.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A must read!. Like most books of a commentary nature, Richard Manning spends most of these pages describing how agriculture changed the world, and not with the all too common culture hype. Did we live longer, enjoy life more and have free time as member of a hunting and gathering community? It seems so. Manning's thesis is that agriculture is and historically has been the recipe for most of the evils we now look elsewhere for the demons. The dinosaurs of the Industrial Age are everywhere, but firmly in control of agriculture, through massive government subsides. Processed "foods" made from corn, wheat, rice and sugar made from corn compose most of our American diets and make us FAT!There is however a deeper metaphysic in the book that should put it on everyone's reading list, and that is what really makes us human. "Against the Grain," gives us an insight into that history, not available elsewhere.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great Price, Poor Quality. I bought the Envision because of the price and what you get as far as specs.The first one I brought home would not power on. So I took it back and got a different one.The quality of the product is not that great. The plastic casing of the flat panel is just cheap. The cover on the back where you tuck in the cables has really small tabs that break off very easily, so be careful.I wish I would have spent a little extra and bought a Sony or Viewsonic$LABEL$0,0,-100

Huge Disappointment. We planned an entire camping trip around the recommendations in this book and were sorely disappointed. "Yellowbottom" campground WAS paved, was cramped and there was no privacy whatsoever. We ended up in a Forest Service campground fifty miles away that was better by far.

Much better than HP!. This is my first Canon printer. Previously I owned several HP InkJet printers and one HP PhotoSmart printer. The Canon is leaps and bounds above HP. The main reason is that I have not had one single issue with it. It's smooth, quiet, prints beautifully. I like the separate ink tanks. I'm on here to buy a black replacement, which the printer kindly let me know was low. With HP, I always had issues with my PC not recognizing the printer and having to unconnect it, reconnect it, etc. I've owned this printer for about 6 months and am very pleased so far. It was a great deal at the $219.99 I paid. The copier and scanner work fantastically, too. The quality of the color copies is amazing -- especially considering how fast it copies and prints. It's so easy to be able to make a quick color copy of something rather than having to scan it in, then print it out. This printer is a great addition to any home office.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Worst game ever - not just among pirate games. This is literally the worst game that I have ever played of ANY genre. Comparing it to the original Pirates! by Sid Meier is very nearly an insult to that classic game. Simply put, this game has a terrible user interface, gameplay is difficult and BORING (gameplay refers to ship-to-ship combat, navigating through towns and swordfighting) and is incredibly BUGGY (as in constant crashing). Honestly, this is an insult for Bethesda to release to the gaming public in light of their other games (as in the Elder Scrolls series). Unfortunately, if a pirate game is what you are looking for, then this is about the only game out right now. I'd recommend, however, that you save your money and wait to get a game worth playing. Or at least a game thats FUN to play.$LABEL$0,0,-100

If you pay for this nonsense you are funding the sickness behind it. I don't care if the book is amazing... it is being sold as the biography of a young boy. Not a fiction novel. The idea that this sick and perverted woman would create such an elaborate and twisted lie to play on the emotions and mentality of a nation is just pathetic and sick. I hope this woman does check the responses on Amazon, I hope she cringes every time she reads someone's response to her joke of a book. I haven't read it, won't read it, and would never put a penny into it. There is absolutely no excuse for this book ever being printed in the first place, and under the title non-fiction biography at that.

Product Support is Essential!. I recently purchased Rosetta Stone Spanish from Amazon.com. I was initially delighted by the product and its approach to learning a new language. I then started having problems. I realized that an essential part to writing Spanish is the inverted question mark at the beginning of every question. I could not determine a way to make this symbol and I contacted Rosetta Stone Support via the internet and via telephone. I was amazed to learn that the normal level of support could not solve my problem and was told I would have to talk to a supervisory level. I was finally contacted by supervision 4 days later. In the meantime, I decided that this was not going to work and returned the product to Amazon.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Thrilling!. When this book came out last year, it was acknowledged as one of the most awaited novels of the summer. I read an excerpt online and couldn't wait for it to come out.With such high expectations, the question to ask is..did it measure up?? I would say it did...for the most part. At times, I found the author was perhaps trying to create too eerie an atmosphere, to the point of being unnecessary.Otherwise, the story is amazing. The history behind Vlad the Impaler and the surrounding folklore and myths is absolutely captivating. The geographic locations Kostova takes the reader to are exotic and mystical;Romania ,Hungary and its political ties. These aspects of the book were expertly interwoven into the plotline, which was fast-paced and gripping. The characters got more interesting and provided more depth to the story as the book went on.

Probably the Best and Most Current Book in the Field!. For my money, the best and certainly the most current book on the history of Chemical Warfare.

Scrumptiously Illustrated Fantasy For All!. Having always been fascinated by those giants who roamed the planet eons ago, I had to have this one upon its initial publication.

Most are "good" and commune well with their fellow humans; but the T-Rex is still his usual grouchy self, much to the appreciation of us who were raised with the knowledge that the animal was one mean carnivore!By placing the setting in the 1800's, the book could have been written by Wells or Verne, which gives it the feel of a classic.And a classic, it is.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Dramatically lower your blood pressure & cholesterol!. I eagerly read this book, since my partner has had lupus for over 20 years. As we adopted the vegan diet suggested in the book, my blood pressure has dropped from 140/80 while on 2 medications, down to 110/70 while on NO MEDICATIONS. I have also dropped 24 pounds since April (07). I thought that giving up coffee and sugar (especially chocolate) would be nearly impossible, but now I find that it has virtually no appeal for me.

Nice idea... poorly executed. Expensive with low quality.. I got this for my son for Christmas a few years back. At first, this seemed like a really cool toy. Its one of the few planetariums that actually project white stars instead of the inverse. Unfortunately, it was plagued by defects related to low quality. At first, a wire became disconnected from the planet projector light bulb. I soldered it back on and it worked. But ultimately what did it in was the failure of a position sensor on the main projector mechanism. The projector would keep turning and turning even after hitting the mechanical stop.

A perfect reason why people need to just shut up.. Berit Kjos is trying to push her personal beliefs and authority in this book. She fails to see that the true purpose of education is not to tell people what to think, but HOW to think. Berit Kjos is going the close-minded route and saying that we should tell our kids what to believe in instead of HOW to believe. It's very important for our kids to know HOW to think because that truly holds substance. Telling them WHAT to think , like how Berit Kjos outlines, means nothing. It's a terrible example of the closed-mindedness in our culture today.It's also poorly written as well. It's nothing more than an bunch of personal inferences.

Ooo....I just can't get enough of his stuff! 1980 ME!. I totally dig this track, but it gets pretty tired if you listen to it all the time. I'm not crazy about the two remixes in this import (probably cuz I'm so fond of the original album versions). However, his DUET with Elisa Fiorillo in "Right Dead Back On It" rocks! We all felt that he should have included this in his album "Spin". Catchy lyrics and fun to dance to! And finally, the acoustic version of "Insatiable" almost brought me to tears. His voice is so compelling and I admire the influence of Kate Bush's "This Woman's Work" sung towards the beginning and end.I received this CD through an Aussie mate and I was excited to hear that he released "Crush" in Australia.

interesting but pretentious. There's interesting information here, about the role offshore tax havens play in our global economy; much of it is quite revealing, as we learn about the Cayman islands, and what corporations do in order to avoid paying taxes. The author gets pretentious, though (and nearly unreadable) when trying to put a philosophical spin on things... there is a long chapter on that which is simply indigestible, and the interpretations are so forced as to be laughable. If you can overlook that, though (just skip those parts) you'll get some interesting tidbits of information about the way corporations operate.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Yeah, this isn't much good.. Conor Oberst's lyrics and songwriting just get worse and worse: while at least in the past he was able to write somewhat-interesting lyrics and come up with creative arrangements (such as the "Every Day and Every Night" EP), here he patronizes the remains of country music in a series of lachrymose, overwritten ballads that constantly strive after universal relevance, but just come off as self-righteous. The album's best moment is probably the single "Lua", but even that one's pretty lame. "We might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain"? Deep, man.Self-pity and self-absorption have rarely made for interesting art, and no musings about "What history gave modern man / A telephone to talk to strangers / Machine guns and a camera lens" will change that.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Glitzy, but frustrating for younger kids. The program requires a lot of fine motor skills. It's too frustrating for my 3 yr old. For example, there is a coloring page ("color all the squares blue"). There are so many of the squares, and they're so tiny, that even I get a little frustrated trying to maneuver the mouse onto each one. In addition, the product is set up around a theme of "save the stars". Kids at the younger end of the age range, such as my daughter, would probably benefit more from a program that lets them "wander at will" a little more. (Try Disney Preschool.) Or, at least, a theme that's a little more laid back. (For example, Pooh Preschool, where the goal is to help everyone finish their work so they can make it to a party.) I also highly recommend JumpStart Preschool.My daughter is at the young end of the recommended age group, so maybe she will grow into it more. For 3 yr olds, I recommend staying away from this one.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Respectable. Here's a book that read much longer than it really was. By the time I got to page 150, I felt like I had been reading it forever. But make no mistake, this author knows exactly how to pen a novel that I anticipate what the next page will read. With his picture perfect dialogue, Erick S Gray has obvious street credibility and is a master at displaying it in this twisted tale of drugs, prison, sex, violence, deception, murder, and mayhem along with the consequences brought on by the desire of money, power, and respect in the ruthless streets where there is often no escape. You can't help but want the best for Ricky and hope that the angel on his shoulders, Mr. Jenkins can save him from not only Kinko but himself.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The Facinating Fusion of Kharma Zhu. Five stars for four amazing musicians! It's fitting how the first song on the album is entitled, "Music In My World." The worldly sound of Kharma Zhu incorporates rock and roll with flamenco, funk and blues. The music is upbeat, sensual, and even playful at times. "And Again" is another great song, using carefully crafted syncopation and Danny Marcus's falsetto to create a surprisingly sophisticated level of listening enjoyment. "Slave" takes the audience by storm with it's funky bass line and sing-a-long potential. This album brings you up and takes you down and makes you want to dance... A must have!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Tempramental. We got this item from Walmart and I was not jazzed about it AT ALL. When we hooked it up to record, we could not get it to record one channel while we watched another. Then the tray stopped working after one week. I sent it to Samsung and they fixed it but it still didn't work right. When it was downstairs, I had to trick the tray to open and then trick it to close (HA! I could only do it... my husband could not). Then we moved it to the bedroom and miraculously, the tray started working.I've never been excited about Samsung products and this type of thing is why. We only kept this thing (for viewing not recording) because we already spent money on it and figured it would do until we were ready to switch over to blueray.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Mystery solved. Next!. A sullen girl is imprisoned in France. A young nun in Brazil is tormented by mysterious abdominal pain. Father Joachim (Gerard Depardieu), the priest-surgeon assigned to the nun's case, is mystified by her ailment and fascinated when its cause cannot be determined. Perhaps he sees in the young woman's secretiveness a reflection of his own violent past? What is the connection between these cases and the mysterious words "screel deen" that the nun screams in her agonies?The filmmaker strings us along for the better part of an hour, as we tease out the mysterious connections. We are treated to mysterious voodoo rituals on the beach, a nosy journalist wannabe, an improbably love story and a mother with secrets of her own. There is so much deliberate confusion and unclear switched identities that by the end, I wasn't sure what happened and I cared even less.BTW: This film is rated R only for 1 shot of a nun binding her breasts during the opening credits.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Saved My Dog's Life. I have a small 12 yr old death row pound rescue that started to fail so quickly that I was making plans for euthasia and cremation. I took the dog to the vet thinking she had diabetes but blood tests showed a borderline liver problem (elevated enzymes.) My vet was gone on Friday when I found out about this drug from my mother, whose dog was saved by this drug, but I couldn't get in touch with the vet.The vet wanted to wait another 6 weeks then retake her blood. I thought, she won't live that long at this rate.Since it is non RX I just went ahead and ordered it on a Friday night.By Monday it was here and I started her on it immediately. That was March 17. As of the 26th, she's 100% better, eating like a wolf, lots of energy AND buying from Amazon is half the price or less than the vet would charge. It costs about $21.47 a month.Thank you Amazon!!!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not so great. As a mom of twins i thought this would be the perfect solution for the beginning. And i used this thing for way too long. It is IMPOSSIBLE to steer and you will find yourself straining and backing up a million times just to make a turn. Id say its pretty handy for 2 months max.

Terrible - save your time and money. Grisham's worst book by far (and I've enjoyed most of his stuff to date). A mediocre apology for the self-inflicted losers in society (drug abusers and prostitutes fare better than guy working 90 hours a week). Apparently, Grisham, having made plenty of money to date (which he earned), now feels sufficiently guilty about it that he wants the rest of us to help bring social "justice" about, so long as he gets to define the term. I could have lived through the social whining if there had been a story there, btu there wasn't much of one. An embarassment for Grisham and a complete waste of time.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not as good as it looks. This chair looks great. A friend of mine has one that is the same type of design but made from tubular aluminium and canvas that is so confortable that we fight over who gets to sit on it. I thought this chair would be a classy version with the same comfort so I bought 2. Boy was I wrong.The chair looks great but it is not comfortable at all. The end of the seat is too short or too long and your legs rest on the wood bar which is not at all comfortable. I'm not sure how it can be fixed (I think that the seating surface needs to be longer so that your weight rests on the seat and not the end bar) but it really is a design flaw.It also creaks very loudly when you sit on it.Definitely not worth the money as chairs but they do look nice on my deck! I now consider them purely ornamental.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not great for my daughter's hair type...or my nose type. My little girl is two. She has fine, but pretty wavy hair and it appears that it'll grown in very curly when she gets older (like her father). Though it hasn't grown in fully yet, I decided to hunt for a good detangler now to prevent nightmarish experiences with brushing hair later.Suave For Kids Awesome Apple Detangler does seem to make my daughter's hair easier to brush, but that's about it. Even the tiniest amount makes her normally shiny hair look dull and flat. The smell seems okay at first (like green apple flavored gum), but then has an after-scent of cheap hairspray that makes me feel a little sick if I smell it too long (can't imagine how gross it could be for her if she has my nose :) ). It may not impact everyone that way, but if you have a kid with fine hair and/or you or your child have a sensitive nose, keep looking.$LABEL$0,0,-100
more features adds a frustration factor. I thoroughly researched cordless phones before buying Uniden and was surprised and happy that the replacement had many more features at a price substantially less than our five-year old Uniden: corded base as well as remote cordless handset; digital screens on base and remote for caller ID and speed dial/redial features and a plug for optional headset use, something that helps me a great deal. The negative: speed dial programming. The old Uniden model programming was intuitive, something that took about fifteen seconds. The new speed dial allows for entering a name with the speed dial number and a process that has my owner's manuel dog-eared from use. Press a wrong button and it's start over time.

thank god I checked it out of the library. It amazes me how being related to someone gives you full-fledged access to do things that normal folks would take years of living to acquire. I thought that I would get a really good book but boy was I wrong. My big question is "Where in the hell was Alice when her daughter needed her?" I guess she was writing those other whacked out books after Color Purple. This girl has issues that most of my biracial friends never had to deal with..ex: like a mother who was never there. I'm still trying to figure out how she can wax on for endless pages about "Color War" at a camp but we have a two paragraph mention that she is now in a relationship with a female. When did this occur?$LABEL$0,0,-100
about EF! ?. Unfortunately this book is not really about EF! I was looking forward to learning about the operations and organization of EF! but instead was confronted by the authors own autobiography, largley about his work as a private detective. I wish the book had dealt only with EF! and extremists environmentalists instead of the author himself. I feel like the author missed an opportunity to provide an interesting account of his dealings with EF! Aside from obvious content flaws, the book was also written poorly making it a confusing and monotonous read. At the same time, I am glad I read this book because it seems to be the only one of its kind.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Husband loves it!. I bought the SkyScout for my husband for Chistmas with more than a little trepidation since customer ratings and comments seemed to be all over the place. I was concerned that he would not have the patience to go through what many of the previous reviewers had in order to get the thing up and running properly. It turns out there was no need for worry. After doing the online update, the Celestron has worked like a charm. Getting a GPS fix takes a few minutes, but after that it works amazingly well. He's been able to identify countless stars in the past two weeks and so far, he's totally thrilled with all that it can do. The SkyScout has been wonderful for finding a particular constellation and them identifying the individual stars within it. The informative audio information is not only educational, but surprisingly enjoyable since the recorded female voice isn't too robotic. I agree it's a somewhat costly item, but from my perspective, the WOW factor has been worth it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A New Johansen Reader. This was the second Johansen book that I read. I picked up Firestorm on CD to listen to during a long drive and instantly, I was hooked. The characters were memorable and the dynamic between them was incredible. I admit that this a little bit of a "chick" book (the fairy-tale ending is a perfect example of this) but I was holding my breath towards the end. Since then, I've read some of her others, but this is one of the best ones she's written. Bernadette Dunn did a great reading of it, which only helped me get really involved with the story.

the worst reprint possible. the colors are way off and quite ugly, they blur and the lines are quite thick, and lacking of detail. this is basically a reprint of a reprint of a reprint, the book that comes with is fine though. when compared to a friend's deck who got me into tarot, these just dont work at all and i dont get the same intuition as i do from his deck that he let me barrow, and his are over 13 years old, these look brand new but are as said before absent of the same vibrant color and detail. and that is important. just a bad experience for a first time buyer of tarot cards. i did want rider waite deck though, thats about the only thing they got right. could any one recommend the original to me with the same vivid colors and detail that i am seeking?$LABEL$0,0,-100
One of my favorite Bruce Willis Movies. I love this movie. I don't know why. It tries very hard to be a serious, black noir ganster movie and it ends up taking itself too seriously.

Fallout Boy- uhhhh another trendy crappy band. I have heard the entire cd and I couldn't even bare to listen to it again, its just that bad.

Over Priced. I totally agree with the reviewer who implied Acorn Media is short-changing the public, who consistently wait for the new Poirot DVDs episodes. This set is minus two episodes, already available in Britain.If you want all four episodes, "Mrs. McGinty's Dead", "Cat Among the Pigeons", "Third Girl" and "Appointment With Death" you can order it as "Agatha Christie's Poirot - Collection 7 [DVD] [2008]" from the Amazon.uk website. It is produced with a Region 2 DVD format; so you will need a DVD all-region player or one that has been adapted to play both Region-coded DVD's. You can probably get this cheaper too from overseas than Acorn Media, which has consistently been over-priced and always behind in putting out the episodes of this Poirot series and other mystery series.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great Idea But Does Not Work :(. The idea of a signal booster is a great idea, but you are lucky if it works. I read the reviews before buying and thought, hey maybe my phone would be different, maybe my service are would be different, but I am lucky if I get an extra bar and if you are in a building, home or basement, I do not get anything different than what I used to. It was cheap and at least I did not waste a lot of money, but still it would have been nice for it to work.

Don't judge this book by its cover. . .. I am not new to spellcrafting, but I was feeling the need to give my practice a little boost. I headed to the bookstore and waited for a book to come to me. This one sort of dropped into my hands and didn't want to leave. I was sort of mortified by the Harry Potter references and put off by the cheesy cover art. But since I had "asked" for the right book to come to me, I took it home even though I would not have chosen it myself. Surprise! This is a great little handbook. It is simplified, but as someone already familiar with many magical techniques, I found the brevity refreshing. The techniques and perspective are solid and sound, but the BEST thing about this little book is that the spells can mostly be done using handy, everyday materials. Its a great little reference tool, compact but covering a wide range of magical subjects. Im glad I didn't judge this book by its cover.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A mishandled "Voice". Yes, Mr Watson has the raw material for an attractive operatic tenor, but by the evidence of this CD the vocal material is still quite raw indeed. If he pushes, strains, and bullies his music in the manner heard in this album much longer "the voice" will be a mere shadow of itself in no time. Compounding the problem are the ill-considered re-arrangements of original material. The distending of Giordano's miniature marvel "Amor ti vieta" - to point out just one example from so many - shows how much the singer and his music manager misunderstand the music! Pass on this problematic CD and rush out and buy Naxos' superior Bjoerling album for a taste of a "real" voice.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Dull. I have read many, many books about vampires, so perhaps I am jaded. This book was slow and dull. There is little plot excitement, little character depth and little originality. Parts of the book read well, but other sections read like the worst pulp fiction. It was a short book, so I was able to force myself through the whole thing, but I don't think I would have bothered if it were any longer. If you absolutely love this genre and have run out of everything else to read, you may find it just ok. If you are new to this type of book that start with almost anything else. I'm hard pressed to think of another vampire as hero/with romance book published in the last ten years that is worse.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Only the first cd is any good.. What is this stuff for anyway? Sound torture?The first cd is ambient "space music" although it ends on a light industral note.

I had to listen to these in order to test them for skipping since the discs looked like they may skip.I felt like smashing my player getting through disc 3.

Folks, if Megadeth came on it would have been a relief!It is also good that I did not listen to all three discs at once!!!!!Now for the price of a used copy, disc one is worth it for the ambient music.

Sigh. this would have been a much, much, much better movie without the twist ending. A mother and father want to punish the serial killer who tortured and killed their son. Honestly, who wouldn't sympathize with that? So Mom and Dad kidnap the killer while he is being transported to a prison and lock him up in a empty cabin's basement and torture him.This is not easy for them, as they are not evil like the serial killer is, the mother especially has a hard time sometimes. Makes sense. Realistically done. Super.However, the twist ending blew everything out of the water. Now, there is not necessarily anything wrong with twist endings, as long as they are delivered and executed well and enhance the plot. In this case, it did NOT happen. It only ruined the movie and completely cheapened the story.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Music to mellow out to. I'm still a high school student, so I have loads of homework to do each night. The thing is, I really like to listen to music while I work, but most music really distracts me. That's why I love U2's ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND. I can listen to it and just mellow out and concentrate on what I need to. The melodies are soothing and relaxing, but they also have some nice, mesmorizing melodies. My favorite tracks are BEAUTIFUL DAY, STUCK IN A MOMENT YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF, ELEVATION, and WALK ON. I would recommend this CD to everybody. Just a note though, U2 isn't the kind of band that you really sing along to or anything, their songs are to be listened to and enjoyed, not vocalized by the listeners :-) Enjoy!$LABEL$1,0,-100
The worst kids' video I've ever seen. This is the worst kids' video I've ever seen. Whatever you pay for it isn't worth it. The 30-minute video began with about 10 minutes of sales pitches (previews) of other videos made by Kid Vision (all equally excrable). When the "feature" started, an incredibly loud, phoney woman came on as host. She made my toes curl. When the primates finally showed up, one was wearing diapers, which gives you a clue to the educational value of this "Real Animals" video. In other places, the primates cavorted with the kiddies.

Most people seem to love this camera, but there area few of us that are not getting very good clarity it he pictures.Other than that, I love the camera's size, features, feel, & ease of use.$LABEL$0,0,-100
HOSTEL part 3(hopefully the end of the series). if there was ever a law in hollywood that should be enforced is labeling movies with a previous title. HOSTEL and HOSTEL part 2 are instant dark cult classics that brings the meaning of fear and asks oneself can this really happen?HOSTEL part 3(i have to call it that...) starts off like a ripoff of the hangover throws a BHC symbol and there you go!! The movie doesnt develop. The characters are weak, and the ending was so-so but it doesnt hit the point,If you a have a buck to spend at redbox and liked the other two. go ahead and rent it. its worth a buckIf Eli Roth doesnt do anything with the series, LEAVE IT ALONE!!!!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Adrenaline Rush Action. Blade was a treat to watch. I took my girlfrind, who though we were going to "Ever After", and she loved it too. The begining 10 minutes and the last 15 are the best. After the movie I left the theatre ready to fight a few vampires myself.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Ultimately Just Dull. This sounds like it could be really cool, in a David Lynch sort of way..., but strangely, after a couple of listens it becomes very irritating. The sound quality is pretty awful. Sometimes it comes across as exploitative (at least that's what I thought). This is one of those CD's you pull out when company comes over, but since it's nearly impossible to listen to an entire song you might want to save your money.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Set your goals? Now all you need to do is achieve them....... If you've set all your goals, and need to figure out how to achieve them, this is the book for you. Full of sensible, practical advice and procedures for drafting (and sticking to) plans, it surpasses every other book on goal acheivement that I've read. It's not too hyper, if you like a book with a quiet 'tone of voice', but it's never-the-less inspirational with it. Buy it, read it, apply it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Wouldn't recommend for trimming the nether regions.... I didn't buy this for my beard, I bought this for shaving below the waist. True story.What I don't like about this is that it is a trimmer but is sized like a pair of clippers. Normally, trimmer blades are about half the size of clipper blades. The blades on this are way too wide to do intricate trimming, beard or otherwise.This just doesn't fit comfortably in my hands, it is just way too thick and I can't comfortably trim with it.They need to market this as actual hair clippers instead of a trimmer. It's just too thick and bulky to be a trimmer.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Yet Another, Season 5 Disc 2 Victim - Disc Unreadable. I'm another victim of the poorly pressed disc #2. Anyone who buys this should check disc 2 to make sure it reads. They should do this a quickly as possible to make sure they can return their set, if they end up a victim. I highly recommend not buying this as a gift for anyone. No one is going to like getting a bad dvd set. Definitely not for Christmas!!!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Ornish has the answer to better health. Like Dr. John Mcdougall, Dean Ornish proves that the diet, we as humans have eaten for millions of years in the key to good health. We have only eaten a high fat, high protien diet for the last 100 years. These food were limited to the wealthy and they paid the price with things like, breast, postate, colon cancers. These diseases are unknown in those cultures that follow all low fat, low protien, dairy free diet. He proves that most all cronic illnesses are related to the rich American Diet.

See "Saw". Sociopath movies usually aren't my bag but this film came recommended to me by a few unlikely sources so I checked it out. When the film started out it was suspenseful but the inevitable comparisons to "Seven" started to float through my mind. About the midway point the film kicked into second gear and delivered some twists that are superior to "Seven". Outside of an above average script for this genre type there is superb direction by James Wan. Wan really has a sense for establishing mood and paces his film well. About the only really qualm I have with the film is that the characters aren't really fully developed. For those who are a little squeamish, the film does contain some intense and grisly scenes but on the whole it doesn't go over the top.$LABEL$1,0,-100
toothsome but enjoyable.... I agree with another reviewer. Miss Quick's newer romances are a bit longer wordwise. But the longer length is not needed and I hope she goes back to her older writing style. That said-With This Ring's was still filled with Quick's signature humor, quirkiness, intelligent characters and sensuality. It was also refreshing to have a 40 yr old hero and 30 yr old heroine. This book seems written more of a adventure than and "I adore you" romance but is still quite enjoyable. The love scenes are well written, especially the first love scene-against the wall, woohoo-is smoking!All in all-even a mediocre Quick book is better than most other romances out there:)4 stars-recommended:)$LABEL$1,0,-100
Sucked - do not buy this book. Rating the author is senseless because the book (especially car books) never have enough pictures and detailed descriptions of the unique features of the selected car... however this book is a waste of a read. The author is way off base, his conclusions are nonsensical and he is ranting about something nobody cares about. I ordered it by accident, gave it to a friend as a present and he returned it... just my 2 cents$LABEL$0,0,-100

Probably a waste of money.. Not so sure this is great stuff. I gave it to my 9 year old arthritic Leonberger, and it made her sleepy and VERY grouchy. She didn't even want to take it and I gave it to her anyway. Normally I give her a potato bread sandwich with Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM, Vitamin C, Turmeric and blackstrap molasses, which she loves and which quite obviously helps her feel lots better and quite perky. I only gave her this because I was running late and didn't have time to make her sandwich. I'll put it in the First Aid Kit, but we won't be using it every day.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not bad for the price. I installed this on my Rhino. It fit fairly well, however I can not zip the doors closed all the way. I also found the windshield hard to see through, so I roll it back up over the top (I installed snaps to hold it in place) It stays in place while towing.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Good for the $$$. Hey, they're 50 bucks. What do you expect for that price? For this price, they provide decent sound, play loud enough for most environments, have good bass response, and decent highs. It's hard to criticize for the price. If you think you're an audiophile, you shouldn't be buying $50 speakers anyway. Break out some serious greenbacks and buy something that is designed for your "discriminating ear".$LABEL$1,0,-100

epilator. Before buying this product I read all the reviews on Amazon and the theme was basically the same. It hurts like hell the first time you try it but it is worth every penny. The first time I used the epilator it took me about half an hour a leg. I almost gave up, however the second time was less painful and the third time was like normal. It's a similar thing with waxing, but in the end it really is worth the initial pain$LABEL$1,0,-100
a fun crime caper set in south Florida - Miami Blues, part 2. Charles Willeford has definitely improved with age. His earlier works were a mixed bag. Competent, but no humour. However since the 1980s Willeford has developed a sense of humour which matches his ability to crank out good crime stories, complete with memorable characters. 'Sideswipe' carries on in this tradition.In 'Sideswipe' with have a violent ex-con, a disfigured ex-stripper, a retiree who just lost his wife, and a talentless artist caught up in some shenanigans. Solving the caper is Hoke Moseley, our quirky cop from the novel 'Miami Blues'. Actually most of 'Sideswipe' concentrates on Hoke and his odd family whereas the crime story itself is a relatively minor element to the book. But overall it works well. The overall effect is funny without being stupid.Bottom line: competent and fun.$LABEL$1,0,-100

IN STINK. n sync is just another baby band. They are such poseurs. One of the babies said he was going to pay Russia to go into space on one of their Soyuz rockets. Of course, it was just a publicity stunt. He was too scared and the Russian space agency is still waiting for him to say yes to the stupid stunt, which he won't, because he is a poseur like the other members of NSYNC.They do not play instruments, they do not write their own songs, the babies probably cannot even dress or feed themselves. They were spawned by the mega corporation "Disney", and they are one of the many contributing factors to the decline of this once great civilization.Baby Bands will fade in popularity like the leisure suit and the pet rock methinks.$LABEL$0,0,-100

And people call this music. For all the people who are things like this is my new favorite song about "Everybody's Free," you need to check up on your definition of a song and also check p on your definition of music while you're at it. Even if you like the speech, uuhh excuse me song, how many times can you possibly listen to it? It's like listening to President Clinton's State of the Union adress with some really bad music in the background. This song and this album are a disgrace to the world of music. The only enjoyment I have gotten out of this song is when my local radio station took took the music and wrote a new, enjoyable speech that makes fun of everything Baz says.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Entirely too hard to do, but definitely not the "no pain no gain" concept. Using this wheel is EXTREMELY HARD, especially if your are severely over weight.Its difficult to work your abs out with this product because it strains the hell out of your back!. The wheel is also very small, and it gives little to no support of your upper body weight, and its very hard to maneuver.I bought it, rolled it once, and threw it in the closet so it could just collect dust.Its just entirely too difficult and the only "gain" in this workout is some sore knees and some back pain. There are other products out there much more effective and easier to use.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Mostly good, but breaks easily if dropped. I'm on my third one of these and will not being buying it again.The problem is with the design, specifically, that it breaks easily if dropped.The small loop attached to the main plastic bone is very fragile at the attachment point (which is very small) and, since it's part of the mold, cannot move. (it's like an "O" that attaches at the bottom, rather than an upside down "U" shape, as other brands have).It's also made of a more brittle hard plastic, rather than a more forgiving soft plastic, meaning that it tends to break rather than give under pressure.If you accidentally accidentally drop your leash with this thing attached (even a short distance from your hand to the ground), you'll probably cause the ring to snap off, rendering it useless.This happened to me twice already.Otherwise, it's not a bad product and works well, but until they address the issue with attachment ring design, I can't give it a full endorsement.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not Worth It. This was the first clip art package I purchased, and I wish that I'd made a different choice. First of all, the images are not terribly high quality. The vector image can't be used in other program. The browser application is non-instinctive, and does not allow you to view thumbnails of images without actually changing disks every time you want to search a different category. There are a few images, photographs, mostly that are usable, but the majority of them look dated and ill-concieved.My recommendation is to check out Big Box of Art.

If you don't like it.....watch it again.. This movie grows on you. I thought it was just ok the first time, but upon further review I thought it was hilarious.

Pre-order is canceled (Make a statement with your wallet). I was very excited about the release of Star Wars on blu-ray until George Lucas decided to get involved with the damn process. Once again he thinks making changes to the movies are for the better when in fact all he is doing is pissing off his fan base. You would think he would have learned the last time he made changes, but "NOOOOOOOOO". Pre-order canceled and I want nothing to do with this now. The once brilliant man has completely lost it. For anyone else who is upset about this, make a statement with your wallet. DON"T BUY.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Resentment? More like revulsion. The title may see it all--Gary Indiana seems to resent everyone, especially if they're attractive or intelligent (like Dominick Dunne). He has no insight into the people he so recklessly attempts to portray (even minor characters that are easily identifiable), and he seems to think that he can aim poison at them without regard. The whole thing backfires--including his weird views about Southern California--and the reader ends up laughing at this silly concoction, not at the characters involved in a real tragic event.$LABEL$0,0,-100

This model sucks. Don't buy.. My wife and I purchased two of these units for our daughters' families last year at Christmas (2003). Just as everyone else explained, they lasted about 6 months and the DVD player quit working.I don't know why the guy that posted a 5-star rating on this unit, and says to not complain about Philips or Magnavox, can make such a claim considering what all of us other "non-experienced electronics users" have to say about this unit (I'm a both a computer services program manager and video/dvd producer, and have never considered myself so unknowledgeable about electronics).Perhaps he bought from a different lot. It would be interesting to find out. Mine says "Manufactured:D August 2003".

Every parent in the U.S. needs to read this book!. I was anxious to receive this book since my own son has been diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease twice. Ms. Collins story about her grandson is a touching one. She does a nice job describing the impact this devestating disease can have on an entire family. She is obviously a very devoted and caring grandmother, and the story she paints of her grandson's life is moving and inspirational. She is the first of thousands of families in the United States to express the horrifying impact of this disease and I applaud her for her efforts. The information about the disease and the consequences of not receiving treatment contained in this book is something that should be readily available to every parent in the United States. Sadly enough, however, there are still millions who have never even heard of Kawasaki Disease.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Never Even Got to Play it. I am a Sid Meier geek. I love Civ and all previous versions of it. I also play Pirates. I was so excited, as were previous reviewers, when I received this game, I ripped it open in anticipation. It installed fine, no glitches there. but I was never able to play it. I own a nice computer that exceeded the system requirements. I called "technical support", what a joke that was. After being disconnected 4 times, I finally got a human who told me to try a fix that had nothing to do with my problem. After 5 hours of applying that fix, the game still would not work.
