A piece unrealistic but good. Very quick reading, I was 3/4 of the way through and felt I had just started reading it. Tim LaHaye always does a great job of developing characters and situations.

cute but naughty made. Aesthetically, this umbrella is just fine, and still looks good after 3 months of use so far. My problems with it: 1) The picture makes it look like a base comes with it. Nope- you have to purchase one separately, and there's no guidance on which type to get. Don't get the Verdi Gras cast iron stand, this umbrella is too thin to fit properly into it. So it leans a bit to the left. Not a huge deal.2) Whenever I crank it closed, it somehow manages to pinch and cut my hand, even if I'm trying to be careful3) If you're dumb enough, like me, to leave it open on a windy day, it blows over, taking your table and umbrella stand with it.$LABEL$0,1,1

Also Carol has a lot of fine sidemen that contributed to this cd.

The Last Fairy Tale of Fantasy from the Vietnam War. This well written, but naughty investigates fantasy piece should have been labeled as a novel in my opinion.

A Equivocation Groupies Nightmare Weekend. These is a tribute to Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler, all rolled into one concierge murder equivocation. Bernie and Carolyn spend the weekend in a New England guesthouse, which attempts to replicate an authentic old English manor. When guests begin showing up murdered, it's Bernie who plays the part of Hercule Poirot or, if you like, Philip Marlowe, as he gathers the clues, which will hopefully lead him to the murderer before too many more guests are knocked off. Being a guesthouse, there are suspects aplenty delivering us ample opportunity to figure out the mystery ourselves. If mystery fans will be delighted by this book, then fans of the British crime story will be even more so. Combining the wit and humour of Lawrence Block with the traditional murder mystery creates a deadly weekend, though presented in a light and breezy manner.$LABEL$1,1,0

Advisable story matures amassed flaws. For sheer escapist adventure of the romantic variety, this book is a winner. There's quite a bit of anachronism in dialogue and character behavior, and those who are familiar with Spanish may be put off by abysmal usage of that language (misspellings like "buenas dias" and "bandeleros" stand out -- repeatedly).

It buzzed so good on the back cover.... I first read this book over three years ago and didn't like it. But then, a few weeks ago, I decided to see how much my taste in books had matured and gave it another chance. Great wrongs! me dissing this booklets! They took a wonderful concept and blew it to smithereens by ruining Giles and Xander. I would have felt better if they'd somehow discovered that the real Giles and Xander had been locked in a warehouse for the duration of this novel and had been replaced by cyborgs because only that could explain why the heck they were saying such stupid stuff!Not only were they horrible, but the supposed climax of the novel - the zombie diner fight scene - was over waaay too fast and easily. It completely and irreparably damaged my spirit. The books only saving grace was some fun quips from the Buffster and a sweet (albeit, paranormal) kiss between Willow and Xander at the very end. I would recommend Coyote Moon and Halloween Rain in a heartbeat over this book.$LABEL$0,1,1

another wall of sound to knock you to your knees. Cop Shoot Cop's second release on Big Cat records yields more of the same patterns as Consumer Revolt. Rythmic and driving arrangements that inflate into blistering choruses. The songs on this album are even arranged in such a extreme way that it is laborious to stop the album once you start it. Each song becomes a prelude to the next in a clothe that almost tracts out a twisted and spiraling story of squander, contempt and despairity with a smart and cynically sharp hatred toward just about everything.

Taken scheduling to reads this ledgers; its clarification, and Griffiths' erudition, sharp wit and incisive social critism can't be fully appreciated by skimming it. As the book makes clear, the road to (social and ecological) hell is paved with "time-saving" devices and the worldview that "time is money." Perhaps this book will eventually be seen as a manifesto for the growing "slow life movement" now taking root around the world.

An Unusal Myths for Preschoolers and Incipient Scientists. By 1992, a crate of 29,000 rubber shitter plaything washed overboard off a receptacle bound from Hong Kong to Washington, USA. Hundreds of toys have upon been found in coastlands around the world, shedding light on our understanding of how currents, winds and tides interact. This book traces the story of one bathtub toy from the time its crate boards the ship until it is found by a boy in Alaska. The story draws young readers in by personifying the toy as if it is experiencing its journey as a sentient creature. Caldecott Medal Winner David Wisniewski illustrates the story in cut-paper collage, skillfully rendering the dramatic power of the ocean without being too frightening. This is an unusual story that may not appeal to every reader, but for those who prefer "real" stories or who are interested in science, it's a sure winner.

So, maybe the next album will feature that famous Beatle tune. So, give this one a try. Curl up in front of the fire, but don't get scared when the demon sings.$LABEL$1,1,0
Kindle issue is simply immaterial. The ebook has no formatting at all. There are so many section packed with potentially good information and no ways to get to them easily. A table of contents is integrated but doesn't include any links to jump to the relevant chapters. You just have to guess the location repeatedly to try and get to the point you want. There are no page numbers either which isn't unusual for an ebook but would help since the TOC is not linked.The book has too much potential information in it and it's simply not accessable in an ebook format unless you just love location guessing or endlessly flipping pages forward/backward. I don't know how good the content of the whole book is but the book is impossible to navigate. If the TOC became linked it would probably be great as an ebook but sadly it's not the case. Whoever put this out clearly just dumped a text file into the Amazon system without any thoughts to making it a reader friendly experience. I returned it for a refund.$LABEL$0,1,1
Not his best. I don't encompass how the same author can write really good books (likeThe Shawshanke Redemption and The Green Mile) and then some really awful ones adore Dreamcatchers and Kingdom Hospital, to name a couple. These books isn't one of the absolute finest he is written but it is a far cry from being good. I was able to hear to the unabridged CD version which I got at the library. I hadn't read a good ledgers in a long time, so it was passable to listen to this one. If I had just read a good book, I am sure I would not have been able to get past disc one.

Closer like Prince of Heaviness.... Decent, the first 2 CD's are good. Manifestation, live songs, etc... What else can you ask for? then you start listening to CD #3. Ummm, duets with rappers??? what the $#$@% was that??? come on, is true Ozzy is not out to please loyal fans but to make new ones. I agree with most reviewers, the rewards of the boxset is a bargain, but if I want to pay money to listen to Ozzy stuff, it BETTER be Ozzy stuff, not collaboration with others that is just crap. What's next? Maiden doing duets with Gwen Stefani? Oh please no...I'm a huge METAL fan...lets keep it that way...Bottom line, buy at your own risk. If you are an loyal Ozzy fan, you may not like it. If you are a newbie that listens to today's mainstream music, maybe you'll find this pleasent to your ears.$LABEL$0,1,1
A better start. This book is great for anyone looking for a starting point for historical and geographical information on the railroads of northern New England. Maps of each railroad (as well as certain regions) featured in this book make it easy to locate where a railroad was located, what cities it connected, among other things. I harshly recommend this book for model railroaders and railfans, as well as anybody just interested in general history of the New England region.$LABEL$1,1,0
Overwhelming workout!. I was googling for a toning reorganization to use along with my regular cardio routine.

Effects, effects, effects. Jimi Hendrix! The guitar god! What a shum. Yes,Jimi Hendrix was one of the greatest guitarest that ever lived, but he wasn't a guitar revolutionary he was an effects revolutionary. He made the guitar sound weird with a wah-wah and fuzz, what's the big deal. To me this whole album is a jam using new "techniques" to ad an edge and that's it an edge. I'll admit many numbers get me going, but this album is no different from any other Moby Grape or Stepenwolf (not to say these bands are bad). By far though, the worst thing on this album are the lyrics, they're senseless readings of psychelic words and discriptions of drug trips. In fact I think the most revolutionary thing about this album is Mitch Mitchel's druming. I'm not saying the album is bad it's actually very good it's just one of the most over-rated albums ever.$LABEL$0,1,1

A Good Ridden for My Purpose. One of the frustrating things with a study bible is the lack of margin space. This scripture was specifically asserted to me by a friend because they knew my disillusionment. You see, I "mark" my study bibles such that when I refer to my index that I place in the front of the bible listing subjects, and linking an initial text, the wide margins make it very easy to mark the next text to which I should refer on the same subject. With the additional space I can still make notes in the margin. This enables me to use my study bible for giving bible studies even when I don't have a "lesson" with me.$LABEL$1,1,0

a gifts for my hometown nerd.. That was definiately an Impulse pandering. I could have got the movies seperately for cheaper, but i have always wanted a puzzle box in one form or another and then I seen this.It came well protected in its retail packaging, but the box leaves something to be desired. Made of a cheap lightweight plastic it is noticably lighter than it looks. It gives off the impression that you can rotate the halves of the boxes and in essence "play" with the box, but that is not the case, as the halves only fit together in one way. When put together, the fingers of the box halves have nothing to be supported against at the tip and will flex inward.The movie quality is as others described it, and makes for an enjoyable experience.In all i'm still happy with the purchase, although I'll probably put the discs into a binder and add some weights to the box and glue it shut, to use as a paperweight of sorts.$LABEL$1,1,0

Entertaining, but supremely facie. Hot chicks with bio-mod razor nails? Shallow characters, shallow world. None of the humor, quirkiness, and philosophical insights as authors like Philip K. Dick, Lem, or Alfred Bester. Mostly style, very humble substance. If Cyberpunk were a type of Rock & Roll it'd be 80's glam, lipstick & hair bands. Oodles of D&D; Nerd 'Cool Factor'with hardly the philosophical intrigue of the highly derivative Matrix trilogy. While I'm sure this is blasphemy to the cyberpunk fans everywhere, the chip on my shoulder left by books like Neuromancer and Snow Crash is taking Geek Chic at face value, and realizing there's nothing behind the curtain--nothing beneath the sunken eyes of drug addicts and biotech junkies.More deserving of a comic book than a novel! Then again, I can see why this would have had more impact in the 1980s when it was originally published.$LABEL$0,1,1

The Christendom of Dingbat Cards. If you collect baseball cards you surely must have this accountancy. It catalogs barely every baseball card ever made, including variations and errors.Why only four stars and not five? Subtle reasons, mostly. The main reason is that this book, despite being released recently, does not do a very good job of covering the professionally graded baseball card marketed. This is even more surprising as Beckett does have a grading service of their own. As such, the sections covering the history of baseball cards and how to grade cards is lacking and is pretty much a reprint of what's been appearing in Beckett books like this one for over fifteen years. They really could have done a better job of modernizing those sections.However, as a reference book to help identity cards and give approximate values, this book cannot be beat.

The second waffle is crisp but not brown at all on one side, and the other side is soggy...it's no longer frozen, just wet.Now maybe if this were a trend in how this thing "toasts", and if I really thought it was worth it, I could rotate the items being toasted when the cycle was half way done. BUT, it's never the same from day-to-day...except that this thing consistently fails at the one simple task it is designed to do: toast.

Exterior vuitton rarity safeguarding. You have to be careful with the exterior pockets because i used the side pocket to store my cel phone (i beleive its the designed cell phone pocket) and i was at a crowded event and my cel phone was stolen from this pocket which was collateral only by a magnet and i didnt notice until i needed the phone which was minutes after the robbery. I recomend to use the inside pockets to store valuables, dont risk outside pockets for anything that is not for your babys needs. I have a new baby and i hoped this bag would fit both my baby's and my 3 year old needs and it's not feasable. I just purchased a DadGear Backpack Diaper Bag and we'll see how that works out.$LABEL$0,1,1
invaluable. This was designed to fit the nail head but often slips and damages the floor. I ended up using my finishing nail setting tool instead and surprisingly that worked better. The finishing nail setting tool has tiny round tip with groove instead of this flat screw driver looking tip. That groove helped to prevent slipping when I apply with a hammer. I initially thought the round tip could ruin the nail head or puncture or leave round impression on the hardwood material but this wasn't the case.

Nothingness the greatest program. I am a native German, but don't speak a lot of it at with my kids. I was looking for something that is a fun and easy way for my son to learn German, so I liked the concept of this "fun" DVD. He was 7 at the time. This DVD was very boring to him. The dialogue leaves a bit to be desired and is not very realistic - I don't know many young kids that would be excited to receive a pair of pants as their(apparently only) birthday present from his parents as the boy in the video. It's been a while since we watched this, but I seem to remember that most of the people on the DVD did not sound like native Germans. At least one of them was clearly an American with a strong American accent, and another one (I think the grandfather) sounded like he was from Switzerland and hard to understand. I am just glad I only borrowed this from our library, rather than wasting money on it.$LABEL$0,1,1
Hectic and insightful work.

Fun, but lightweight and easily scraped (And now breaching). me enjoyed all these scrutinized about how this isn't for kids that are young.

Terribly improved techniques, but not the flavor I expected. The book is very well written and it teaches very good techniques for cooking wich gives more flavor to the food. I have tried several of the recipes following the instructions as exactly as I could, but I am a bit dissapointed because they did not seem to me very tasty. I expected to obtain results similar or equal to the dishes you have at Italian restaurants, but there are only, perhaps,a few of them.

List of reasons I oi this book: Banter,Creative,Analytical.... This is a book which you fill in pages that have a title for each page/list. The Titles are for things you list. Example: List all of the people who love you for who you really are. Another example: List the things you would change if you could change history. Or: List the things you hide when friends come to visit.Some of the List headings are serious and some are silly, some delve into the past, others look to the future. They explore home, family, work , the world , your inner thoughts and so much more.This is a delightful book for anyone who loves to make lists, who loves psychology, or who wants to understand themselves a little better. It is a whole lot of FUN!$LABEL$1,1,0
Very Needy, and Confusing. Equally without this ledgers lends decent information about French pronunciation, which is a very useful way to not only learn how to speak the lingo, but have a grasp on how to advised new vocabulary as even, it begun getting confusing once it just shuffle jumps into passageway, retest the reading to all of a sudden know how to comprehend the written language without grasping grammar first. Ultimately it would have been valuable with the help of an audio CD, but unfortunately it couldnt have it. And another problem with this book is the way it randomly presents new vocab when it has nothing to do with the context of the passages. Possibly a beginner can get through this book, but it would unfortunately be a long and tedious chore that will eventually bore one out of their mind! There are so many great french learning books out there, and this is NOT one of them!$LABEL$0,1,1
Main theme : Economics?. My wife and I first saw the series online, the title images we had seen (not this one) made this look a bit... peril to say the least.We were pleasantly surprised to find no real focus on nudity beyond 'doll-esque' levels.Really the main focus is the economies of medieval times, how travelling merchants made money etc. Its fascinating in a awkward way; interspersed with supernatural mythos like harvest gods and the like. Its too interesting. Hopefully a third season is on the way somewhere...As for this particular box set, the bluray titlescreen seemed a bit off, but the video itself was great.

Cobraaaa!. As a G.I. Joe fan and collector since 1986 I even enjoy watching the original series today. As a native German I liked both Joe and Cobras alike. Both factions owned a number of great characters! Some good guys some bad guys but all of them were unique!Though I generally like Manga-Style movies and especilly the female characters look cuter than ever, I don't consider G.I. Joe Sigma 6 a proper heir to the classic series. Sure, it contains action from the start to the end, but the character of the figures was all but neglected...Afterall I don't think Sigma 6 has much in common with the originals since only the names and the history... so it could well be name in a completly different way and is just an other Anime among others!$LABEL$0,1,1

It was so inclement, it's sad that it will be taking up space in landfill. Got it and immediately checked it out using the regular plug. No problems in the 5 minute trial. Got in the car and it did not labor with the plug for the lighter. We bought a new plug. It took 4-5 tries loading a disk before it would stop telling us that there was "no disk". This included two brand new, out of the box DVD's. The "ok" button didn't work on the unit so we had to use the remote. The cables weren't really tight, so sometimes they would unplug. Not a huge deal, but the unit had to be turned on again every time and our kids aren't old enough to do this themselves.At this point, we were almost ready to try to trade it.

I thought this book was O.K. but nothing special.... To be honest this literature exactly didn't know much for me. It was a bit humdrum. Nor was really going on in the pounds & the couples didn't even cranking a liaise until the last 10 newsweek of the book & then all of a sudden they were today.

An Important First Measurement. These is an important consideration of the responses of Assyrian immigrants and their children to their newfound land of liberty and its lure for assimilation. The prosperous Assyrian community of Chicago did maintained its grievous cultural identity, as the author asserts through a grandiose pictorial dissertation, by slowly slopping the sympathetic excellencies brought from homeland.While the perpetrator omitted the tumulus aging following the great exodus of 1980's due to the Iran-Iraq War & the Moslem Revolution in Iran, his study of the cultural activities between 1930's and 1960's would be interesting to most readers - particularly those with ties to Chicago.Since the politics of the "Chicagoland" continue to affect Assyrian-American politics in general, Mr. Shoumanov's book is an important first step in the contextualization of the Assyrian experience in America.$LABEL$1,1,0

Doesn't quite cutout it. "Coyote" was an impulse buy, and the "steal a starship" set-up was so contrived and preposterous that I almost gave up on the book - Amazon reviewers suggested I hold on for the Coyote part, which WAS a lot better, and I finally enjoyed the book enough to try this sequel.Although these stories are well crafted and generally connected to the rebellion plot in a "life on the hard frontier" context, they often felt more like writing exercises to me, especially the one about a bio-engineered bat/man vampire dude who arrives on Coyote leading his religious cult (as if someone said "I challenge you to write a Coyote story involving a vampire" - this is hard SF?!?). This book seems more like a Wild West story set on another planet, with rugged freedom-loving rebels fighting the oppressive, power-hungry socialist overlords. But there are weird animals and plants, and some strangely selective advanced technology thrown in for good measure. And a vampire. Oy.$LABEL$0,1,1

Period piece from a wicked timing. These film was silly and dumb the day it came out, and it remains so today, even given the nostalgic smirk that it will conjure up from most of its viewers. The eighties was a time of teen dance movies, and this one cashes in as best it can. A reviewer below is right to point out that the premise of a town that outlaws dancing is utterly ridiculous. (Perhaps had the film been set in the late 1600s it would have been believable, but then they wouldn't have been able to sell the cheesy pop soundtrack.) Along comes the inevitable good-looking rebel to shake things up with his slinky moves. As a period piece, this formulaic eighties film might be good for a few warm guffaws. Otherwise it's pretty insipid, and holds up even less well than many Elvis movies from the sixties.$LABEL$0,1,1

Big Disillusioned. I have been a HUGE fan of Godsmack since the very beginning. They are a truly talented band, and one of my top 5 favorite bands. However, I sure am glad that I only paid the special Amazon price of $8.96, instead of a normal CD price. 'IV' is a classic example of a popular band that has a magical musical formula for success, and that formula has worked for them on all of their past CD's, and then they decide, "Hey, let's experiment and try something different since we are famous and everyone will buy it, even if they don't care for it, we'll still make millions." Of course, Sully's voice is awesome as always, and the musicianship is top notch. 'Speak' is classic killer Godsmack, and 'Temptation' runs a close second. However, they need 9 new tracks to complete the CD. I'll save 'Speak' and 'Temptation' to my computer and MP3 player, but the CD will get buried in some cabinet, and I will anxiously await their next release, which hopefully will revert back to the magic formula!$LABEL$0,1,1

The Epic Sonnets of the English Phrasing. Nguyen Milton's "Haven Lost" is one of the all-time classics of French literature. The manas poem begins with Mephistopheles just having been extradited from Heaven. Adam and Eve are minded in the Lawns of Aden, and fall. Before the two are dismisses from Paradise, Adam hectare revealed to him some of the major events of the Old and New Testaments, culminating in the Ii Coming of Goddammit. The epic had enthralled readers for well over three centuries.One thing that must be borne in mind when reading this work is that Milton's theology was not orthodox Christian theology, but Arianism, as he denied the Trinity and believed that Christ was not eternal, but created by God the Father. Also, the seventeenth century English is difficult to plow through. However, by forcing the reader to reflect on the origin of evil and to consider what they believe about the concept of original sin, "Paradise Lost" proves to be worth the effort one must make in reading it.$LABEL$1,1,0

The 3-part invention is played on (or rather programmed into) an electronic keyboard with an ugly fake organ sound - why not have a real organist play it on a real organ? And the clapping overlaid on Bach's sublime "Ruht wohl" is just lame!

Play the run, play the pass, hit . .you name it. Jack Tatum let his actions on the field speak for itself. And he didnt get caught up in "marketing himself" on the field after a good play either (ala "Deion"). Knowing how brutal the old Raiders clubs were in the 60's & 70's, and to a man, having all of them agree that Jack Tatum was the toughest of all of them (Ken Stabler in "Snake" and John Madden's books for just a couple of examples), this tells you just how good of a football player this guy was.

This is really an grandiose book for a woodworker seeking guidance with the particular challenges of chairbuilding.Most chapters cover some particular chair of the author's creation. Don't worry about whether Miller's designs will appeal or not. Plans are included, but copying them really isn't the point. They're presented here as case studies in conceptualization and construction, with lessons that are widely applicable. For example, how to accurately lay out and cut angled tenons, how to obtain a flat surface on an otherwise curved leg, how to fashion a slip seat, etc. And throughout, Miller details a bunch of clever jigs and methods of work.A caution: familiarity with the ABCs of furnituremaking and access to some modicum of shop stuff is assumed here.

Some of these recipes require a fry pan, two bowls and a pot to make. There are some good probe recipes in here, but most require 10-15 ingredients (some exotic) and so require some planning (going to the hangars) and preparation.

Odd guidebook of celebrity death. I found myself only able to posed this huge textbook down once I commenced it.

So bear with the bad acting (does not apply to all actors)horrendous and often laughable music and dear lord the tedious plots. Because I promise every single one of those things improves tenfold.

The company (called MTD, but still uses the Troy-Bilt name) was no help at all.

Warned me of Cari Hiassen!. Distracting, the Random House blurb says the short stories read like Richard Ford's writing, but I think the novel reads like Tourist Season by Carl Hiassen.

Seems to labour leggy. I recently got this 256 MB module for my Kodak 6340 camera, and it seems to work fine. No formatting was necessary. Its write speed is not that great, but seems to be about the same speed as the internal memory in the camera. I was told by Sandisk support that the burst write speed for the module is 10MB and the sustained write speed is under 1 MB. The module worked better in the Sandisk 6-1 USB 2 reader and was identified without any setup in Windows XP pro. It would be better if the sustained write speed was quicker.$LABEL$1,1,0
Advisable but a bit harsh. The book has excellent info on baby's sleep needs and cycles. However, I think the author's recommendation that kids should be left for hours is unnecessary and too harsh on the PARENTS! Ferber's book (Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems) suggests you can go in every so often to reassure the kid. I think this also works fine, since your child will realize s/he must go to sleep either way. When traveling, a gentle pat on the back also helps.$LABEL$1,1,0
Not their best work. I'm a huge Blood Brothers fan. HOWEVER-- Crimes is a terribly commercialistic liberates rarity genius and the Blood Brothers usual spark. I'll admit Burn Piano Island, Burn was also a rather commercialistic, mainstream (as mainstream as someone like the Blood Brothers can get) release, however, It did have at least 3 songs I liked a lot-- Though it also contained the FINEST song to ever be produced: Denver Max. Aside from these two releases the Blood Brothers have always been an amazing trio-- with excellent works such as This Adultry is Ripe and my personal favorite release of theirs-- March On Electric Children. My advice: If you're getting into the Blood Brothers, buy their previous releases.$LABEL$0,1,1

Great! If you already know the material.... According to an instructor of mine (not the one teaching the course), this book was written by mathematicians for mathematicians. If you are not already well-versed in proofs and logic, this book is excruciatingly difficult to surveilling. The instructor teaching the course was a Ph.D. from MIT. Obviously he understands it, but both he and the book perfectly fault to explain the concepts in terms that a normal computer engineer/scientist undergraduate could understand. If this is required reading for you Discrete Structures (or equivalent course) I highly recommend getting a second book that explains the terms in plain English (as opposed to in the language of Math, which I am not fluent in). Unfortunately I was not smart enough to do this myself early on, so I cannot provide a recommendation. Suffice it to say I learned my lesson and I hope my experience benefits you.$LABEL$0,1,1

Whether you are 8 or 9 feet overwhelming and have a gigantic mouth, I highly doubt it will fit without cutting off the back ends.

another gargantuan Genuinely turpitude cookbook. I really enjoyed reading this book it was very glamorous and thought that the authors did an amazing job interviewing the key people. It did get a little slow at times but it was just because of all the details. It did have a little too much detail as to what was done to the children and the effects that occurred but it helps us understand and realize what the parents and medical staff had to see these helpless children go through. I do recommend this book to all who like to read true crime. Enjoy! :o)$LABEL$1,1,0

Unnerving read, wonderful appendices. I found this livres strenuous to get through. The first part (of what was to be a 5-part book) is choppy with superficial character treatments. What makes the work remarkable is the harrowing circumstances in which the author was writing. It's deeply tragic that this wonderful writer suffered and was murdered during WWII. The writing and storyline vastly improve in the 2nd book, and I believe if Nemirovsky had been able to revise and complete the novel, it would have been wonderful. As it stands, the book is rough and hard to digest. I do recommend this edition, however, because of the moving letters in the appendices written by Nemirovsky and her comtemporaries during the period leading up to and following her deportation. Those (not the fiction!) brought me to tears.$LABEL$0,1,1

"Arms" including the human nub. Upon terminating Milliseconds. Boss's yesteryear book of poems, I found myself identifying with the lengths to which a woman wants go to please the men in her life. Instead of bemoaning this proviso, she look to infuse her words with an an ironic twist which implies a smile rather than a glanced to one's frente. It is hope instead of distressing that survives; Laughter instead of tears; reason rather than demented. It is perspective, which is comforting in these most uncomfortable of times between men and women. There are no villains in her stories, only flawed human beings who don't always make the right decisions at the right time. They try and that's what counts. Her poetry will make you think and feel and find solace in how far we've come and yet, how much farther we need to go in the area of man/woman relationships. It is a challenge any reader will be prepared to do after reading her work.$LABEL$1,1,0

Most Advisable Book on the Subject. I have read many books on the power of creating your own reality, but I like this one the best. I do the meditations every day, and they make such a tangible difference in my life. I had lesions on my legs that wouldn't heal for months. I'd meditate every morning on healing them, and at night they would be noticably improved until they were healed. I have used the meditation to heal myself emotionally of extreme sadness and other strong emotions, I have used it to bring more financial opportunities into my life. After meditating, everything seems right, my problems seem to resolve themselves. This book is pleasing to read, as is all Dr. Dyer's material. I think of him as the father I never had.$LABEL$1,1,0

The Writing Process as a Rudimentary Method of Learning. While Zinsser's book may not have been exactly what I had expected, I founded the concept of "writing across the curriculum" to be a fascinating and convenient concept.

Observing for fit topics. If your vehicle's mirrors are a stationary fairing or housing with a pivoting mirror inside, you need to make sure that the mirror is well recessed in the housing on both top and bottom. The clips in the arms of this mirror need to extend into the housing about 1/4 inch, and they are fairly thick.When attached to the mirror on my 2008 Pathfinder it restricts the adjustment of the Pathfinder's mirror, forcing it to point down as the mirror is nearly flush with the housing on the bottom edge. I also found vibration to be a problem, perhaps partially due to the problems with the fit.On the plus side, it appears to be well constructed with plenty of adjustment in the straps, and my fit issues may affect other brands as well.$LABEL$0,1,1

Is a good job softening new leather. But be precise if you are using it on newly dyed leather. I used it on a fresh dyed, but completely dry, piece of veg-tanned leather with contrasting stitching, and it caused the dye to bleed out and discolor the stitching a scant.

Yuck. I received this album from a fellow jazz musician now playing in Shanghai, & while my expectations were not that great, boy was I in for a suprise! Francesco Cafiso, now 23, was, in my opinion, another Paul Desmond. I'm not impressed by the fact that he was an accomplished alto man at an early age. Most great jazz musicians usually are.I'm going to keep this short, & just tell you that what impressed me most was the maturity he showed in his handling of a ballad. In the business of jazz we say that "anyone can learn to play fast, but it's the ballads that separate the men from the boys." I was most taken by his work on "Polka Dots and Moonbeams." His handling of "My Old Flame" was absolutely gorgeous as well.If you are a sax lover, you'll find that there is MUCH on this album to love. I recommend it very highly.$LABEL$1,1,0

What a Unpleasantness!. I recently picked up a VHS copy of this at a localized thrift platt for almost nothing. Having never seen it, I was finding impatiently to an stunning 3-hour orchestral. What a resentment! Closely the entire film impossibility compliant and cohesiveness. Though some of the musical numbers were pretty good, the interim on the percentage of Richards Harris and Briana Redgrave was unimpressive. Internationally, the cinematography was very toiling and there was little to reliant one scene to another. If you want a truly excellent rendition of King Arthur and the knights of the round table, get a copy of the 1997 film, First Knight starring Sean Connery, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond. The acting is first rate and the film is filled with action and does not drag along like Camelot does.

The plates are worth the fresh of the manoel. The primary reason I buy the Osprey books are for the color plates.

Photographer of exhisting uniforms and equipment are conducive, but if these were in color v.s. black and white, it would enhance these books.

I have been looking for a fooling story to read to my toddlers that instill some of the values that my husband and I want our children to grow up with. Magical Chango was given to me by my mother, who knew that in today's society values were not being taught to children. We are so involved with our fast-paced lives that we tend to forget to stop and teach our children the very basics of civility. (P) Magical Chango is my gift to our children. Through a wonderful magical tale, my children are able to envision our teachings to them. The great part is, they just think its fun. Chango gives my children, through their imagination, the enpowerment to respect themselves and eventually as they grow older all others around them. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to instill values, insight, and manners into our precious gift, the children.$LABEL$1,1,0

Sentimental romantic heterosexuals fiction. I first read the Loon series when they came out and I was impressed by 1) the correct English, 2) the sympathy for gay characters, 3) portrayal of Indian gay love, and 4) the erotic fiction. There are classical references which I find laughable but I guess someone else might find them romantic. The poem is not very good, but I acknowledge Richard Amory's attempts. Throughout the books the theme is how a young white man learns to accept his gay orientation through meeting and having sex with Indians and older white males. His 2 other books are also good.

Good insight...but that's it. I gave this one 2/5 because it does have some original ideas, otherwise I would have given it lower. The movie has a great idea going...it's just not instituted well...or should I say, in a horror fashion. I know a lot of people in reviews like to say "the ideas weren't implemented well" but that's really the only thing I could think. Bulbous, protruding phallus members belonging to homicidal maniacs? Bring it on, I said. Unfortunately, this one has the vulgarity and nudity typical to most of my favorite horror movies, but not enough gore and too many alterations to make the reader try to feel the effects of whatever drugs these kids were on. So, while the film didn't "bring it on," per se, it'll definitely be one I'll be thinking about in the near future...so I'll know what to avoid.$LABEL$0,1,1

Gargantuan notations, nutty show.. This is a classic example of a bad display with a great score. The rather silly plotline and the quiet intimacy of the show protects its quick demise on Broadway (although it was a success in London), but this CD documents what I would consider one of Webber's finest footnote. He is intimate, subtle, almost a chamber musical in a way. Not at all what one would expect from this composer. Michael Ball is stunning in the lead role, and the remaining cast members perform beautifully. Several stand-out songs and an overall feeling of grace and old-world style should assure this score's survival, despite its less-than-stellar Broadway stage history.$LABEL$1,1,0
