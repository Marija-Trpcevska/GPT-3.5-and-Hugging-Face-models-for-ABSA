slap-up Product. I recently purchased this because I upgraded to Windows Vista and there is no driver for my onboard sound as of yet. So I hesitantly purchased this, and am very glad I did. Not only do I actually have sound again but it sounds alot better than my onboard did. Im sure the X-Fi and other high end cards sound better, but for the price, I highly reccomend this.$LABEL$1,1,0

hold, a wee bit far-fetched. Retired Secret Service Agent Swamp Morgan is sent to handle a potential 'firefly' case involving the murder of several doctors and nurses at a plastic surgery clinic. Apparently the doctors are in the habit of taping their patients while they are recovering from surgery and blackmailing them with the details at a later date. During one of the recovered transcripts a suspicious transcript surfaces about a bomb plot. Could it just be the ramblings of an unconcious man, or something more sinsiter?This story starts off a bit slow with the killer targeting the doctors and nurses. But the character, Swamp is likeable and methodical in his detective work. The middle section involves Connie, a nurse who was off-duty the night of the murder and her struggle with being bait for the killer.I'm giving this 4 stars just because the ending was really goofy. I can't give it away, but... Well... It was a gotcha type ending you are either going to like or loathe.$LABEL$1,1,0

Don't languish your money!. My husband bought me the Magic Bullet for Christmas. He paid $60 for it at a department store. At first I was so impressed by it. We used it almost every day. When we had our first baby I used it to make homemade baby food to save money. I will honestly say that it does work very well....AT world-class. You'll love it, then be disappointed when it breaks. Before 1 year was up the motor died and it stopped working. This also happened to three of my friends who bought the magic bullet. The customer service stinks and they won't replace it. In my opinion, $60 for 1 year of use is not worth it. You'd be better off spending less on a generic brand blender that does the same thing. I bought a less expensive brand on sale for $15 and so far it works just as well as the Magic Bullet for a fraction of the price!$LABEL$0,1,1
Short of Learning Latin, Greek, etc.. Dear Potential Reader:I have nothing but praise for Dr. Danner's _Discover It_. He has taken one of the best methods for self-help learning, the graduated inductive method, and combined it with accurate information about the origins of English words. The reader is led, step by ill-treat, into developing an ever turgid and more enriched English vocabulary. I would say that anyone who works through the entire book will acquire a level of etymological knowledge and a facility with English vocabulary that normally could only be produced by a course in etymology taught at the college level. My own preference would be for students to learn the relevant languages; _semper nobis linguae addiscendae sunt_. But short of learning Latin, Greek, French, and German, you can do nothing better for building your English vocabulary than to buy and use Danner's _Discover It!_. I highly recommend it.$LABEL$1,1,0

Ranch Style taste to attract a firm unity. I've been eating Ranch way Beans all my life and love them. They were made in Fort Worth, Texas for nearly a hundred years. This year, they were bought by ConAgra, the plant was closed and production was moved to Ohio. That's not all that was changed. The cans used to be brimming with beans with just enough sauce. Now fully a third of each can is sauce...they're selling us WATER. They taste the same and for that I'm grateful, but the can says "Beans" and I expect beans...not water. Some slick suit has decided to maximize profit by compromising the brand. Won't work here and I've bought my last can until I can shake the can and it sounds like it has more beans than water.

Roots of Blink 182. Those of you familiar with Cheshire Cat will already know a few tracks on this album, their 1994 effort. Buddha was made during the first year that the band were together, and it shows their tendency toward whimsical, sometimes silly lyrics. It perhaps more accurately portrays their punk roots than the newer albums, where they define a genre of their own. The songs are poor, fast and frenetic.

tremendous writing on a fascinating topic. I'm indisputable Richard Ellis is a fine fellow. But I just can't understand how _anyone_ gave this book a positive review, and I'm 2/3 through it. The redundancies are ridiculous; it's like he never reread or edited. So on page 108 he gives you a long quote from what he tells you is an article from Roper and Boss -- and in _the very next paragraph_ he gives you _the same quote_ again and attributes it! Amazing! And this kind of thing happens continually. How many times does he tell me how big, say, squid axons are versus human axons? I mean, really: this book went totally unedited. Beyond that the comments of other reviewers that he kind of struggles to fill a book about the squid, are true. Of course some of the amazing footage of the past couple years could've been used to pad it out another chapter, but, there's just not enough there there, or at least Ellis isn't able to make it seem so.$LABEL$0,1,1

650 Holster. This Holster doesn't seem to burst the Treo 650 phone very considerably. The bottom corners of the phone are rounded and the bottom corners of the holster are square. The side supports don't fully hug the phone and make me concerned about the phone coming out of the holster too easily. The top support clips the phone right at the slot for the memory card and doesn't seem inflexible enough to keep the phone in the holster. With an expensive phone like a Treo 650, I just don't get a secure feeling from this holster that it will keep my phone safe and on my belt. I refused to take that chance and will not use this holster. In fact, I already purchased the leather TREO holster manufactured by PALM for about $20.00$LABEL$0,1,1

commodity euphony and features Babatunde Olatunji. This is the same CD as "All The Best From Africa" but at a lower price. Why? Don't know. I would have given it a five star but a lot of the songs fade out long before they are done. It has a good selection of different kinds of music, vocal, percussion, string, etc. The main reasonableness I like it so much is that it features Babatunde Olatunji on tracks 2,3, and 14-20. This is rarely heard Baba music especially to those only familier with his "Drums Of Passion" recordings. Some of the sound quality is not that great but I've heard much worse on other recordings.

I love that it's never greasy or funky smelling like real ground beef and there's never a danger of e-coli from not cooking it enough. It's also cruelty free. No animals had to die in the process! Yay!I use it for chili, taco filling, and it's easy to defecate vegeburger patties just by adding bread crumbs, eggs and seasonings. It can even be formed into meatloaf or meatballs.

What a rule!!. I watched this movie only because Vincent D'onofrio was in it. And am iodin glad that iodine did. I had heard of Robert E. Howard and knew he was a writer, but I didn't love anything else about him. This film shows the depth and loneliness of a man who didn't fit in with the rest of the world; and then he meets a woman who begins to understand and to love him, but ultimately cannot be with him.Vincent D'onofrio gives a wonderful impassioned performance as Howard and Renee Zellweger matches him as Novalyne Price, the woman who befriends him. This film is well worth seeing and I recommend it to everyone. It also contains the most passionate kissing scene I have every seen in a movie. I had to rewind and watch it more than once.

It's a good thing it was free, and also that I can't write a note of disapproval to the author.Soldier Boy is Buffalo Bill's horse, and the book is told partly through his viewpoint, partly in letters from humans and partly with Soldier Boy talking to other animals.An interesting tale of the old west, with a young girl named Cathy who arrives from Spain and bonds with her beloved Soldier Boy.I wonder if Twain planned the ending from the get go, or if he just wanted to finish it quickly...and finish off the main characters, too. I'd love to know why he ended the story in such a gruesome way (a bullfight in Spain).Despite my love of reading about anything equine, I don't recommend this book.$LABEL$0,1,1

slap-up Read, Great Sense of Place. In a former life (as an architectural historian, of all things), I spent a lot of time on the same mean streets of Southern New England as Joe Gunther (albeit with a clipboard and a camera instead of a badge and a gun). Mayor's books are really notable for their sense of place -- I can call up clear pictures of his over-grown millyards and sagging tenements every time I read one of his books.Mayor gets the people right too. Even though his is a cop's-eye view, the villians are not simply generic "bad guys." They are individuals, with individual strengths, weakenesses and even talents.Mayor's books are procedurals with lots of procedure (he's a real-life Vermont constable) and now and then I lose track of a pawn or two in the bureaucratic chess game just because there are so many of them. But overall, an incredibly solid and admirable series.$LABEL$1,1,0

Comparing row in the two religion's main Scriptures is so important and interesting, but the author shine into the "Bible-bashing-mode" so distinctive of many protestants. he does not bonk and does not quote any of the Church Fathers' interpretation of crucial passages, and therefore he fails to make his case agains Islam and its literal understanding of spiritual life. It is a pity, because the author is well-intentioned and enthusiastic. But he talks too much about himself and his friends being "spirit-filled", and he never manages to get beneath the surface of the Christian Theological arguments against Islam. 2 stars for trying to do it anyway. Read instead St. John of Damascus' "Writings" in the CUA series.$LABEL$0,1,1
Decorative Fishing Creel. When I purchased the River's Edge Fishing Creel, I jazz by the price, that it would not be long-lived enough to actually use in fishing. I purchased the creel for my wife as a decorative creel that she could either plant flowers in it, or use with artificial flowers. While the main body of the creel seems undestroyable enough, the straps that are attached are not, also the way that the lid of the creel is attached to the main basket is to flimsy.

The only requisite report peter for the GRE. After purchasing both the Barron's and Princeton Review GRE books, I notice that this ledger is the only one that is requisite for studying for the GRE. While other books contain some useful baksheesh (particularly vocab lists) this official book from the GRE is requirement because it contains rattling past GRE exams. Other leger indite mold exams similar to the GRE, but because the questions have not been thoroughly tested, the questions on these exemplar exams are oftentimes confusing and sometimes just flat out wrong.

single of the safe. When I first heard of this movie during the Academy Awards, I was skeptical of the plot because well, how could a person shield such horror from one's child, especially at a time such as the Holocaust? Yet, somehow, this man did. And the reason I feel that it was like that is because it was a relatively short stay. I don't think he could have pulled it off if it were longer. What I screw about this movie is that I was touched by it. And each time I see it, I am more touched, and I fall in love with a certain aspect of the film. Despite the fact that I am African American, I can identify with this film, and I give it two thumbs way up!! (Personally, it needs more than five, more like ten)$LABEL$1,1,0

It doesn't take long, or too many times of opening the book before the glue comes undone and sections of the book fall out. I tried my best to be delicate to avoid this from happening but, it still came apart.Some of the information is written in a confusing manner and some things are not entirely up to date. The non-updated information is not abundant and one can still learn plenty of information by reading this book.The book does cover everything from the possible cost to the mechanics of a horse, and many other things. It is a good book to have if you're new to horses. But, I would only buy it if you can find a cheap price on it. Simply because of the binding falling apart.$LABEL$1,1,0

But putting the theory into practice was just too unvoiced for me. I'm a mom and wife, and trying to get my family to adjust to something this extreme was simply not reasonable. As it was, I found it almost impossible to get through the day without some form of carbos, and I'm not talking needing big dishes of ice cream, even a simple bowl of rice would have been welcome! As well, I found the lack of fiber in this diet to be a real drawback, and the suggestion to use things like Metamucil and take large quantities of vitamins to be unrealistic.

I can usually deal with bad actors and actresses (as I said earlier, I'm a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies) if the plot is decent enough or if the story is at least entertaining enough. But this is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! There are no, I repeat, no redeeming qualities in this movie. So, why did I give it two stars you ask? The extra materials, that's why. There are some pretty neat things on the rest of the DVD (such as Nite Owl Theater bloopers, outtakes of the movie, and, of course, a new episode of Nite Owl Theater).

Although Shakespeare recovered, he later dissapeared from the scene and it was not mentioned what happened to him? Overall I am very impressed.$LABEL$1,1,0

True, the reserve is an good compilation of the various Fitzgerald translations of the Rubaiyat by Omar Khayyam, yet the editor, Christopher Decker, render an extremely natural, biased veiw of the Islamic impression. Decker unneccesarily leave his enraging opinions, for example, he foretell Prophet Mohammed (SAW) a "false prophet" of the Muslims.

Worthless slaver. scorn the endless high-pitched hilltop rhetoric and broadsheet reasoning of Darwinists, the simple fact is Dawkins and his diciples of the church of naturalism can't excuse the right-down inception of anything, even a hydrogen molecule, allow lonely the macrocosm. on-key, empircal evolution (i.tocopherol. version, speciation, option, and transmitted range) is all intimately and just - and irrefutable - but it has vigour to do with root, and will remain a delusional fantasy for those who reject the Biblical record of sudden creation and the subsequent global water catastrophe.

Planet Bike Protege 9.0. So far I eff the Planet Bike Protege 9.0. When I installed it and tried to take it off (very hard to get off), I thought I broke it ,I didn't. The other night I got my bike ready to take with me to work the next day so I could ride it at the park and completely forgot to protect it from the dew. When I got off of work, I checked it and was working great! I had bike tire issues (note to self, don't air up the tires to the maximum p.s.i that is on the tire) so I haven't really gotten to test it out much. One tip is you push it from the bottom to the top to reset it. I was trying to push down and then up at first and couldn't figure out why it wasn't changing. To reset it, just keep pushing until completely 0's out. I don't think it was very hard to install on my mountain bike. It took me about 20 minutes to install and adjust it.$LABEL$1,1,0
unspectacular. I'd written a review for this game when I was in the middle of playing it. When I finished, I wished I hadn't spent the time. Here's the deal... I hated almost every character in the game. They were annoying! How are you really expected to enjoy a gaming experience when you hate all the characters you play as?What I liked in the game was the deep story, and I eff the combat system. Combat was actually a lot of fun. The graphics were nice too.What I hated involved all the characters and the way they reacted to things. In fairness, there were a couple of characters I liked, like Bebedora (sp?). It may be an unfair comparison, but in games like Final Fantasy, you can go back to various areas, and there's all sorts of side quests and weapons you can get. It gave the Final Fantasy series a lot more depth.Ultimately, this could have been worse, but if they'd just made the characters interesting, it would have been a lot better.$LABEL$1,1,0
Good keyboard but over time letters bust off. My husband is a "hunt and peck" typer. One of our computer desks is in our bedroom. My husband always had to have a light on when I was trying to sleep when he was on the computer working, so he could see what he was typing. I bought him this Saitek keyboard for Christmas last year (2007). Our entire family, including children love this keyboard and it is victimized several hours a day. The only issue I have is, after ten months the paint is wearing off of the frequently used keys. It's not a problem for me, but the "hunt and peck" typers I live with will eventually have a problem. It's still a good keyboard and I may try to put permanent marker letters on the keys eventually and see how that works. Overall a good product. Even if I have to purchase another one eventually, the light is off when my hubby is typing. I'm happy!$LABEL$1,1,0

This spirited smack. I borrowed this game to try it out. I had never played a Zelda game before and had heard that they were really good. But after I played it awhile, I found myself incredibly blase. I got extremely tired of sitting there waiting for the characters to stop talking already! And although Link (the main character) has a sword, he rarely uses it. Then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again. Talk about barely any action. After that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that, apparently, lets him controll the wind. What's with that? I don't call this a "puzzle" game. I call it a BORING game. I suggest you buy a Mario game, which cleverly combines puzzle with action.$LABEL$0,1,1

slap-up Collection. Great collection spawning from Springsteen's early rock (Born to Run, Thunder Road, Badlands) to his cheesy pop hits (Dancing in the Dark, Hungry Heart), his story ballads (The River, Atlantic City), rock anthems (Born in the U.S.A., Glory Days), and his newer rock hits (Human Touch, Better Days). at the end he shed in soundtrack hit "Streets of Philadephia" and some new tracks.Overall the collection is excellent; it shines from the "Born to Run" album through "Born in the U.S.A" album and then the song quality drops a little for the rest of the album. But every songwriter has a "golden period" and sooner or later will decline. Still, even on later tracks such as "Murder Incorporated" and "This Hard Land," his ferocious singing and deep lyrics are impressive. My one qualm is not including the haunting ballad "I'm on Fire."$LABEL$1,1,0
contain sample to move with your mystery knowledge. If the generator would stay to writing mysteries, her books could be among the best in the genre. However she spends way too much time describing people's actions and motives by comparing them to another author's characters. Noone thinks or does anything on Broward's Rock without Annie gloss to herself that the thought or action was just like this or that fictional mystery character. piece I love the bit with the contest that has the characters guessing their fictional origin, this constant "showing off" of the author's mystery fiction knowledge detracts from the story. Any true mystery buff probably knows as much but hopefully doesn't spend their time sizing up their friends and family by this criteria.Stick to the mystery writing and leave the mystery trivia to game players.$LABEL$0,1,1

deserving the money. I bought the Williams Sonoma brand with the aluminum insert as a Christmas present for myself. I already own 3 slow cookers, one 4qt, one 5qt, and one 6qt, all of them different brands. I never noticed that all 3 of them on low setting is not a true low setting until I used my new All Clad. I now know what everyone else was talking about. I made lentil soup and turkey stock both on miserable setting for 6-8 hours and my turkey stock came out clearer because it was on a true low setting. And my lentils were not mush, they held their shape. I prefer the 7qt size because I can freeze half of what is made. Even after we eat the other half, there is still enough for lunch the next day. I will be making my meat sauce for pasta tomorrow and knowing the low setting works correctly, I am sure it will turn out delicious. I also like that the lid is stainless steel, because if I drop it, it will not break. Also, I can put the lid and insert in the dishwasher and it comes out beautiful.$LABEL$1,1,0

And, as the other reviews stated it is very easy to assemble; The directions are simple, I had no problems doing it alone, and it took no time at all (less than an hour(?) - could easily be done in 30 minutes the next time, I think, especially with help). It really does fit together just like giant legos - no tools required! I really wish it was offered in black; the putty color really doesn't fit in well with the rest of the things in my apartment, but I can live with it for now. I've been thinking about buying some large removable peel-and-stick stickers to spruce it up a bit.$LABEL$1,1,0

Feels like thin felt, soft but thin enough to see thru. I ordered these sheets for our guest room, having family over for Christmas and it's cold outside.

fact of fiction?. I realize Mr. Marion says this book is a mixture of fact and fiction, but the amalgamation of both coupled with this writing style, essentially render the whole effort fiction and comic-book fantasy reading. As such, if you read it for entertainment purposes only, it has engaging sections. hitherto many division completely bore you or make you feel Mr. Marin is simply boasting about his supposed prowess and intellectual escapades (not to mention his sexual escapades). In short, after the roller-coaster ride through Tokyo's Chuo-Ku, it leaves you somewhat cheapened, like a one night stand by the author and Wall-Street's biggest. I suppose that was the intent based on the title, but you never realize how bad that can be till the "morning after."$LABEL$0,1,1
Miles Davis quietly guides listeners through "Forrester". Gus Van Sant, the filmmaker responsible for "Finding Forrester," chose malarky pioneer Miles Davis to guide us through this complex drama. Van Sant, who used Elliot Smith's lonesome ballads to pull heart strings in "Good Will Hunting," uses some of Miles Davis' most solitary and contemplative music to accopmany his film on writting. In fact the last-place track on the album "In A Silent Way" musically parallels the act of writting and thinking. The song is complex but gentle and features Miles at his creative, post-fusion best. "In A Silent Way," and all the tracks on this album (some by Bill Frissel) are like well behaved children, evoking all the complexities and beauty of life yet demanding no atttention or energy. perfect music to accompany the solitary act of writting or just a quiet day.$LABEL$1,1,0

There is always 2 sides to a story. I idolized this al-Qur'an! I couldn't put it down. I chose it because I heard the musical was up for a Tony or two and I was looking for a new book to read. Since this book was referring to The Wizard of Oz and someone made a musical out of it I was expecting a light-hearted story with humor scattered about like peanut shells at a steak house. But it is not. I was pleasantly surprised by it's deep story...love, betrayal, jealously, friendship, racism, politics and sex...oh-la-la! It could be a soap opera. I loved it! I couldn't help but imagine the characters as they look in Fleming's movie, especially towards the ill fated end. It is a strange feeling changing your allegiance from one team to another...i.e. Glinda is now bad to me, Dorothy a pawn and don't get me started on the Wizard! :) I just bought Son of a Witch yesterday and can't wait to see what happens in the land of Oz!$LABEL$1,1,0

Troublesome admonisher. This May be the tough electronic gismo we've ever possess. The bragging problem is with the level-headed quality of the monitor itself. On one channel we get major atmospherics, on the other channel we get a high-pitched background whine with occasional tapping sounds which come through loud and clear. It sounds like someone clapping and it's very disconcerting to hear that coming from the baby's room in the middle of the night. We can't discover the baby unless we're so close we don't need the monitor. We're also having the same trouble other reviewers have had with the "light show" coming on spontaneously. On the whole, we're not happy with this product.$LABEL$0,1,1
not big!!!. I've been playing the Madden NFL series for a long time and the 2002 version is significantly practiced than the 2001 version. The improved graphics and gameplay (A.I is smarter now) pretend it fun and challenging. The scoreboards in the stadium now reflect actually time left in quarter, the actual score and other stats of the down.What was disappointing was the fact that they used very much the same sound bites from the 2001 version so the color commentary is boring to someone who has played previous versions. Sometimes the color commentary makes no sense whatsover.Overall, a good upgrade but beware of the system requirements. You need RAM and a good graphics card loaded with RAM as well.$LABEL$1,1,0

This Book was tremendous! Be prepared to rust Caucasian rice 1-2 times a week!

Every week you ate white rice and some kind of chicken "burger". The book talks to like you have no intelligence at all and like you have never made a grocery list in your life. This book is a waste of money and if I could give it 0 stars, I would. This is a book for somebody who has never cooked a day in their life. Don't buy!$LABEL$0,1,1

non big at all. The telephone is actually pretty dear for the price. (At first I was a little questioning.) Everyone knows that there are pros and cons for just about anything. Some of the yardbird for the phone would be the static (which is minor if the phone is appoint), and the fact that it is incompatible with Caller ID. (but who needs the extra expense anyway?). The pros would be the different ringers, the fun color, the fact that you can use headphones, the any-key answer, the pre-set speed dials, and the pager. (I really like the pager because it beeps until you find it-or at least for a couple of minutes- when most phones usually stop after a few beeps). I have even taken this phone into the backyard without extra static. So, if you are looking for a decent phone for a good price then this one's for you (works especially good for a teenage or college student)$LABEL$1,1,0

History of Newton County, Mississippi 1834-1894. An excellent subject of pertinent facts refer to the early history of Newton County, Mississippi. A. J. Brown uses many sources to inform his reader, including verbal interviews of residents of Newton County, court records, federal census records, state records and newspaper accounts. This book is of interest to those who wish to learn more about early settlers of Newton County, and what life was like for citizens after the Civil War. It does not spot upon every family. The primary focus is on those the writer believes are the leading citizens, therefore, those seeking a comprehensive study of this area may be disappointed. However, this history does provide a general feel for the time and place with some detailed discussion.Charlotte GressettGenealogy researcher$LABEL$1,1,0
A fantastic Caricature. gobbler Wolfe clearly has not been to college in the lastly 50 years, because his portrait of college sprightliness is so vastly overblown and beleaguered with every stereotype assigned to today's man of mellow education that the story itself is completely missed. thither is little that is original or even interesting is his genuinely linear refreshing about a girl who can only be characterized as the single most nave college student on the planet, complemented by every jock and frat boy stereotype that exists in nature. I happen to be familiar with the university this novel is based on and I can say that he appears not to have really delved fully into his research in regard to what college life is like there. I feel a more realistic and not so oversexed and oversimplified novel could have been a successful book. But this just reeks of an old man outside his generation grasping at what he thinks people want to read about college life.$LABEL$0,1,1

I was most impressed with the fact that not only does it describe the scientific aspects of tornado formation in dim-witted terms, it also discusses tornado safety by giving kids several examples of where they might be when a tornado hits and the best place to take cover for each situation. While the publisher lists ages 4-8 as the targeted reading level, I found with our library groups at school that our 9-11 year olds were very interested in it as well.

dodgy Little Camera. The value of this camera is its size and convenience. It does not take great photos, but for the most part, outdoor pix are not too bad. I compared exact shots from my olympus 2 and 3 megapixel, and the colors from the casio were a little washed out- not true to color. Indoor shots with low light are bad, as the flash is so small it does not produce very good photos. These are the drawbacks. I got this camera to have when I don't want to carry my larger camera and to take places that I would not otherwise have taken the other. It is cool and will draw a crowd. You will need to get an additional SD card if you want to take any number of pix, but they are cheap now.

They wanted to send another of the same model but we had already been through all that.In the end it was easier to cancel the service and eat all the money we'd put into it so far than to deal with them. Customer service/retention/tech support would not do anything for us. The radio service is great if it works, but if it doesn't, may the gods help you because Sirius won't.$LABEL$0,1,1
Ransom. This is the pip Lois Duncan Book I have ever read! The plot was well, and the characters were secure, but the way she kept the story going as if it didn't even have an end, made me want to stop reading it. I seriously FORCED myself to read this.Lois Duncan is my favorite author, and I have read fantastic books by her such as: Locked In Time, Stranger With My Face, and Down A Dark Hall. If you love reading suspense and thrillers, read these. But if you enjoy being bored and hate having to finish a book because you started it, read this.$LABEL$0,1,1
Second pair and counting.... I purchase my first pair and loved them, now on second pair and quieten love them. inflexible, forgiving but inactive rugged. Break in is fairly quick and I only have a little discomfort initially with the upper ankle area. This is due to the stiff rubber/plastic that wraps the ankle. i do not mind the break in period as this same piece offers good ankle support also. Only drawback is the price, ouch. I have never paid $200.00 which is the price at the time of this review as they are usually around 129.00 to 169.00.Overall a good boot and I also prefer them to the Acadia.$LABEL$1,1,0

A record that will charm to the envy of America. 200 years ago, European nations dominated the world in absolutely every aspect-culturally, economically, militarily, etc. Now, in the 21st Century, the tables have dramatically changed across the Atlantic. The U.S. is now the strongest superpower the world has ever seen. For the first time in history, there is a nation out there with the might and influence greater than Europe COMBINED. If one doesn't believe me, just look the stats up and compare them. One example would be that the US spends more on its military and on technology than the rest of the world COMBINED, let alone old Europe.

Elsie's tarradiddle cover. This is the fifth script in a serial, though this and the fourth book didn't have too much to do with the first three Scripture. The first three - 'Fourth rate Wizards', 'Nothing's comely in the Fifth Grade', and 'Sixth place commode actually Kill You', were typeset in elementary school, but the last two playscript focused on Elsie Edwards.Elsie made her first appearance in 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade' and was in the next book, though with a considerably smaller role.

It arrived and when I opened it I knew we were going to have issues. It came with a very thick instruction manual and the option to watch a video online. Still, I gave it a try. Many tries. The thing is very very foresighted. First you have to fold it in half lengthwise, then you have to drape it this way and that way, pick up and position the baby, then wrap and tie it. Perhaps if I had eight arms or someone to help me, this would have worked. However, after using it a few times, I returned it.

suffer you hear of tunnel vision?. This hold is very disappoint. I was regular dismayed at the face of the author to re-release this script and identify the man he reckon is the Zodiac killer after the man's death. The author really demonstrates how an investigation can beat botched with tunnel vision. A prime suspect is the sole focus and evidence is distorted any way it can be to "prove" this suspect is the Zodiac killer. There were other possible head and suspects that were discounted by the author.By the time you reach the middle of the book, you'll see it is already obvious who the author THINKS is the Zodiac killer. The rest of the book discounts other leads and suspects and focuses on "evidence" that "proves" the author has identified the Zodiac Killer. Very disheartening.It should be noted the author is not an investigator and the identity of the Zodiac killer remains a mystery to this day. The author has NOT proven his "identification" of the Zodiac killer. This book is a shame.$LABEL$0,1,1

Some readers have complained that the book is more soap opera than true crime, but I think that's a big part of its strength.

A slap-up film, but not a masterpiece. The film noir is an interesting genre. Most are crafted in a brilliant manner but the conclusion of the film seems to fall apart, not to mention some of the explanations make no sense. Chinatown has been considered to have one of the greatest endings ever filmed. While it was good, the denouement of Chinatown was definitely rushed and that hindered the film. L.A. Confidential is another noir film, and while it bears similarities to Chinatown, I feel Confidential is the better film. There are many engaging characters with more humor and action. The plot twists are as intriguing as the ones in Chinatown. The performances, especially Russel Crowe, are outstanding. It would be hard to explain this film in a couple of sentences, so I think you should just watch this movie for yourself.

Standout tunes include "Devil Slide" with it's machine gun synth guitar rhythms and dueling solos, the atmospheric Rush styled "Flavor Crystals", and "Borg Sex" which digitally builds to an AWESOME solo climax. Joe certainly had his creative engines running full throttle and if you will listen with an OPEN mind, you will see that he has trailblazed a new path for instrumental guitar.$LABEL$1,1,0
non the big I've say -- but it comes close.... Having met Robert knowing, I had heights skip for this novel when ace originate it. Unfortunately, after LE than peerless chapter I realise that those Hope were ill-founded. "The beat Detective" lack all of the affair that make novels clear -- interesting character, alert dialogue, believable plotlines. Instead, we are apt one-dimensional characters, cliche-driven dialogue and a diagram which simply never have sense.I will quantify all of this by saying that, if you have loved every novel in the "Left Behind" series, you might really like Mr. Wise's novels. If, however, you are looking Christian literature on the level of Frank Peretti, Randy Alcorn or Ted Dekker, you should look elsewhere. In the world of Christian fiction, there are many great choices. This simply isn't one of them.$LABEL$0,1,1

The story line is ho-hum very slow. The main character is a manic depressive woman who is very annoyed with life because it is unfair, and she ended up in the wrong side of the table. So she resents everyone that happened to be lucky enough to avoid life traps and despises those who fell on them. Eventhough the book is beautifully written, the dark mood that the author impress on its main character, permeates to the reader and you become up caught in an atmosphere whereby reading is an effort, so each page develops slow, very slow.$LABEL$1,1,0

Unusual. Brand New is a band that I just do not understand. Lately, I have found myself listening to Deja Entendu frequently on someones itunes playlist on my local network, and I am puzzled. This cd has absolutly no fall at all. Some of the tracks do not even sound like the same band, especially "Play Crack The Sky," which sounds exactly like a Counting Crows song. The good thing about this album is that they aren't doing the exact same thing as every other band in this oversaturated genre. However, much of this seems forced, and that they are trying to hard to be different. I cannot stand the track titles either.$LABEL$0,1,1
slap-up film noir. I'm determine this film for about the 10th sentence as I write this. It is an interesting study of vengeance by the father of a murdered girl who comes to America to find and kill her murderers. There is an interesting subplot in which an older and unreleased film by Terence Stamp is used to show the backstory when he was a young man and his daughter was a child. This subplot finally explains what has happened in the modern story. It is similar and far superior to a recent film called "Taken." In both cases, the father, who has near superhuman skills, takes off after a man who has kidnapped or ( in the Limey's case) murdered his daughter. This is a better film but both are enjoyable. I can watch this one over and over. I'm not sure about the newer film.$LABEL$1,1,0

fantabulous introduction leaving one wanting more. This slim bulk explores the way that music implements the liturgical intent and, to some extent particularly with the antiphons, the way changes in liturgy are reflected by changes in music. Especially interesting is the segment on the relationship between homilectics and music.The music explored ranges from chant to 20th century - the latter more by reference than by analysis. It includes instrumental music and cantatas as well as the classic music of the Mass.One need not be a musician nor a liturgical historian to understand this book. But reading the book will help a liturgist understand the liturgical musician and the historical development of their role.Highly recommended for anyone involved in liturgical planning.$LABEL$1,1,0

defecate the spiritual journey..... ...and that's not a bad thing!! Kristine W has always managed to stay atop the dance charts by making albums that capture the current musical landscape. This album is no exception. I did notice that Kristine seems to be taking a more "spiritual" attitude in her lyrics. As I was listening, I couldn't help but feel like she was having a rattling moment as she was singing...like every song sung was a small burden lifted from her shoulders. It is really great when an artist can convey such emotion like that, while treating us to an excellent landscape of danceable musical textures. The additional disc, mixed by Chris Cox, is really well done also. Everything is listenable...and enjoyable. It's highly recommended!$LABEL$1,1,0

considerably scripted, but block about Clark. Ambrose read his literary expertise as he chronicles the most famous exploring duo in American history. Using journals and other first person witness accounts, the reader is treated to a detailed description of Lewis and Clark's expedition to the pacific. While the research was extensive, Ambrose does relegate Clark to a minor role as he concentrates more on Lewis and Jefferson which would undoubtedly upset Lewis who consistently emphasized the equality of the two captains. The reader should not be surprised, as the title emphasizes this point about the thesis. Despite this pro-Lewis bias, Undaunted Courage is a great resource for information on the Corps of Discovery.$LABEL$1,1,0

I find that the characters are very real, and other than the initial event (the Rapture) all of the following events sound realistically possible (in a novel). I have read many negative reviews from Christians denouncing that it doesn't exactly follow the Bible. And from others saying that it's nothing but religious evangelicalism. To all of those I say "It's a novel". It's fiction. It doesn't have to follow other sources and the writers can say what they want.To me it is a perfect mix, not too far out there and not too much preaching.I would recommend it to anyone interested.

wax of ideas, short on plot, debase of fun!. This book jumps around among multiple characters and multiple times, focusing on crytography during WW2 and the late 1990s. Even so, it is easy to follow. The characters are engaging, the history is interesting, and the book is often hilarious. There is lots of math and computer geekiana, but this doesn't serve as an impediment, even to a reader, like me, with only superficial knowledge of and interest in these things. It's a physically huge book, even in its smallest, mass-market version, but it's still a quick read. At the end, I had trouble summing up the plot, then decided I didn't care.

jolly Groban in a big level. First of all, I'm a huge fan of Josh Groban's. Having listened to all his albums and watched all his DVDs, I got disappointed about Live At The Greek. Unlike many reviewers, the flashes, lights and the rock n'roll atmosphere didn't bother me, at all. The main problem, in my opinion, was his strained and nasal voice, which messed up with a lot of beautiful songs. "Mi Mancherai", "Caruso" and "Alla Luce del Sole" were just unrecognizable. It seems that he was congested and couldn't sing that day, but wasn't able to postpone the performance. Luckily, I've borrowed the DVD and haven't bought it. However, I must acknowledge that he sang beautifully in some parts of the concert. "Oceano", "Remember When It Rained", "My December" and "Never Let Go" were great. The setlist was simply the best of all his concerts. Sorry he wasn't able to make it work that evening.$LABEL$0,1,1

Could be Eastwood's substantially sour to date.... This is not a war film that will be accessible to every viewer, especially those who are only used to soaking up the typical American propaganda war films of the past half century. Of course there are going to be those right winged/ 'wannabe pushovers' who will automatically be persuaded to call out this film as: "rewriting history," when, in reality, they have NO clue/ concept of what actually occurred during this part of history from the POV of the Japanese soldiers, (and still consider any "enemy" to the US as nothing more than "savages.") The fact of the matter is, the film is a true masterpiece of artistic cinema. Many people seem to forget the notion that film = art. "Letters" is NOT a documentary film; it is a filmic portrait of a generally unknown/misunderstood piece of modern history. I would say this subtle masterpiece is Eastwood's best work to date.

Perhaps someone who doesn't already share Moore's passion for social and economic justice might find the humor in "Canadian Bacon" less obvious than I, but I saw most of the jokes coming from miles away (or kilometers, in the case of the Canadian segments). If you're looking for political satire that is both dangerous AND funny as hell, check out anything else Moore has done, as well as "Bullworth," "Bob Roberts," and the Citizen Kane of all political satires, "Network."$LABEL$0,1,1

Like the other person who mark this a ace, my plants were slow to take off, but grew rather larger. I had two different varieties of tomato. My proceeds was 1 tomato for each plant and the tomatoes were not very dear. Unlike the other 1 rating, I did not have fruit flies.

This is an awful group with a great new malarky/classical sound. If you are looking for post be-bop and post Bird jazz listen to this group. I heard them live with Lee Konitz a few years ago at the Kennedy Center and they knocked me out - along with the rest of the audience. They have somehow managed to inject classical into jazz in a way that no one else has - maintaining the soulfulness and intimacy of jazz but bringing into jazz some of the beauty of classical structure. You can't dance to their music but you can revel in its originality and beauty. It registers pretty far forward on the frontal lobes. All the musicians in this group are accomplished but listen especially to the minimalist playing style of Florian Weber on piano. I'd like to hear more of this group.$LABEL$1,1,0

Other brands do not have the amount of elastic to micturate them fit snug around baby's bum. The Supreme's do agree much better, but are not as cost effective.

The author made sure there was a mate for every one of his characters, there even "happened" to be one Black brave to be paired with the regal, non-conformist, former slave woman.The premise to this novel is original but everything else was so cliche' it was embarrassing.The only part of the book the author seemed to put any effort into were the elaborate, porn-like, sex encounters.

The Best snatch was the END. totally of the participants in this nonsense are subject of making me split my sides, but none of them did in this movie. By far the best bit was the ending. Unless your brain has been pierced with a tongue stud, you will get much more satisfaction by giving your $$ to a worthy charity, than by spending it on this!By the way although I live in Singapore, I originated from elsewhere, so don't blame Singaporeans for lacking a sense of humour if you disagree with my comments.$LABEL$0,1,1
Good info but dispense of out of date "science".

Only the Grinch would not love this movie!!. The full Christmas fib ever - manifest by Ted Turner running it for 24 hours straight the last two Christmases.But don't let that stop you. To see the real story of the Christmas story you need to see this on DVD and all its Marxist Rider Beebee gun glory.The redact is superb, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood. It is fond remembrances, without the overly cutsie pie touches. The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.I love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book. To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other. Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.Every family should have this.$LABEL$1,1,0

The slap-up Live Album Ever!!. This is the cheap, rawest, most savage kick a$$ rock and roll record ever recorded! It never gets the respect it deserves. The only other live album that comes even close is Live at Leeds or maybe No Sleep Till Hammersmith. Before morphing into a radio friendly pop band (The Locomotion), Funk were the heaviest thing going. Nobody could touch them...Zep, Purple, nope. What's really cool is Mel's bass is high in the mix ala Entwistle and it really drives the band. And Mark has a guitar sound like no other mainly due to the Messenger axe going into the West amps. This generation needs to hear this album if they think Green Day is heavy!! Absolutely Essential. My favorite album of all time.$LABEL$1,1,0

My effect is that they could be much more than they really achieve. They've got something (that something that made me buy the album) but they fail and never get to a great thing. I guess the fans will enjoy this collection, but casual listeners: be aware. Prometen más de lo que cumplen$LABEL$0,1,1
smashing if you don't want to pay for Bose. I've had these for over 5 years and have never had a problem with them. ane use them on a daily basis at work to drown out loud co-workers, and also when flying. They don't drown out 100% of background noise, but I can't plain considering the price. Only issue is that the little rubber ear bud covers tend to come off easily and if you happen to lose one and don't have an extra with you, then there's really no fix.$LABEL$1,1,0

Everything seem to be overlook.. i buy this power pack for my HP Camera. The first thing I remark was the lack of instructions in the box. There was NO paperwork included with the product. It also contained to adapter fittings, niether of which listed my camera on thier description - althoug, allot to the ... Page, and the Unity Digital page, this is the exact exemplary to use with my camera. (I did prove it out after assumiing the battery would need to be charged for 12 hours like most, and tried the fitting that fit the camera. It worked right the first time, and since then it has not been able to take a picture - reads dead battery on the camera.... perhaps if I had instructions on how long to charge it.....) Overall, neat idea. I WILL try another one, but frankly, I was sadly disappointed with what I got.$LABEL$0,1,1
Not exact. I was very foiled in the pic and arrest watching it midway. This is not an exact calculate of St. Rita's life, I would recommend show on her.At one gunpoint in the film, I thought it was going to get tacky because on her wedding night, there was lots of kissing, sensuality, and then finally they pass off in the other part of the bedroom. This could have been left out of the movie, it did not penury to show this, or all the times Paolo has to take his shirt off, and they could have left out the word [...].
