Wonderful Look at Gay Life in the British Fifties. Neil Bartlett's The House on Brooke Street is a wondrously written look at the repressive 1950's in Britain. It has the erotic charge and the creepy paranoid (with good reason) fear mixed in equal measures to pretend this novel feel vivid and authentic. The unnamed lead chararcter takes the reader through his encounters and furtive loves through the decades to when he writes it all down in 1956 in a very compulsive manner that is lamentable and lonely with the thin shadows of anger, rebellion and triumph creeping in on the edges. It is an evocative look at a time but also a look at a time about to change. A very knowing, readable novel.$LABEL$1,1,0

Great pictures (for black and white), including of the tombs of some of the great Chinese Muslim saints; but regarding content the author displays very little interest/appreciation for the religion of Islam; he presents a book that is quite "fuzzy around the edges," with very little regard for the vast wealth of Islamic/Sufi tradition in China, including the Naqshbandiyya (Khuffiyya/Jahriyya) and Qadiriyya orders. matchless would wish to see in a book like this much more probing and intelligent representation of these truely fascinating people, the Hui Muslims.$LABEL$0,1,1

interesting. I thought the book, being inadequate, was well done. I'm not a tolkien, the man, fan, myself, I just like the books he wrote. It was short enough to keep me interested and didn't go into tolkien worship. He was a man just like any of us. White didn't go into intense depth like some of the other authors, who border on tolkien worship. This book is for those who want to skim his life, his associations, like C.S. Lewis, his wife, etc., to see who he really is really quickly and go on. The few supposed 'errors' as some other reviewers put it, are completely outweighed by the many facts put forth by the author that paint the picture as it is done in other works, but at 30,000 feet. Like I said before if you want more depth and concise tolkien history go to some other book.$LABEL$1,1,0

single of my all time favorite Jane Austen movies. "Persuasion" is a wonderful Word and this is a grotesque movie version of the Scripture. I had a VHS version of this for years and finally picked up the DVD.The cast is spot on - without "big" names to which the script is molded around. It is very true to the book - and evokes in the viewer a lingering wistfulness of what might have been.My recommendation is to read the book first and then see the movie to see the characters brought to life. If you are not a reader, you will still enjoy the beautiful story of a love that survives despite all odds against it.$LABEL$1,1,0

non worth $sixty.00!. I saw all of the confirming reappraisal for this body pillow and salivate over it for some time. It seemed like the just one on Amazon. Boy, was unity unseasonable!

I waken up with pains in my shoulders from the seams so unity removed the overcompensate that came with it as I had read about in other reviews. The next night, same thing. After a week of this I finally gave up. It takes up most of a queen sized bed and I found it didn't give me any support where I needed it. I'm 5'5 1/2'' and slender. No matter what position I was in the pillow was still very uncomfortable. I put it in my daughter's room. Seems the only thing in this house who liked it were the cats.

The light in an otherwise decent series. It seems to be the habit of most fantasy writers (or perhaps their publishers) to forever stick with the characters and worlds that made them famous; this pattern can be witnessed over and over again in the fantasy genre (see R.A. Salvatore, David Eddings, Robert Jordan, et al). The leave, unfortunately, is usually reserve comparable this. nonpareil gets the feeling that even Brooks has grown tired of the series. The plot is nothing any faithful reader of Brooks isn't familiar with by now, and the literary execution is, to say the least, uninspired. Sadly, however, I'm sure that as I write this, Terry's publishing company is pressuring him to come up with yet another Shannarra novel, perhaps this time an epilogue to the series.

Not pretermit much. Buried Alive revolves around a group of college kids who soon learn that the demonic spirit of a woman murdered in their vacation domiciliate is out for blood, and guess who's in her axe-wielding sights? Robert Kurtzman, best known as partner to gore effects gurus Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger (hence, KNB Effects) and the original scripter for From Dusk Till Dawn, channelize Buried Alive, and sadly it number off as another derivative, uninspired slasher flick that provides little in the way of scares or suspense. The acting is atrocious and the story is cliche and oh so predictable (for the most part), but Buried Alive does have a few good moments of note, including some nifty gore effects and a small role from Saw's Tobin "Jigsaw" Bell, who himself up's the creep factor just by appearing on film.

As a doctoral student in clinical psych I'd say it's probably the closest thing to real therapy that your going to see on tv or movies, it's the cheeseparing I've seen. Of course it's sped up to fit one client into one season, but it's pretty accurate in its depiction of how a psychdynamically-oriented clinician goes about work. The fact that he does his own personal therapy is a major plus for the show, it gives you a great view of the human side of the therapist that you don't see when he's the therapist. Overall, it's a great show.

If you are the type of person who easily feels other people's pain then you may need an entire tissue box after the movie is over. I felt everything the movie wanted me to feel.

If the latter is the case, she succeeded.

Yet, I am plugging on because I did read Tami Hoag's last Scripture, "Ashes to Ashes" and ground it riveting. The only cause unity don't just QUIT reading this book is because I've never done that before and I am curious enough to want to know what happens. I can't recommend it to others, though. Do a crossword puzzle instead.$LABEL$0,1,1

A gross book for young Star Wars Fans. I think that this book is middling in complex wording, probly created for kids around the ages 8-12. Even though it was a bit slow, and I prefer more complex wording, it was a fairly good book as far as the plot goes. For older readers seeking Star Wars Books, try the Young Jedi Knights series, but this book is a perfect book for a younger reader.$LABEL$1,1,0

inaccurate size. If you have a great cover wienerwurst (GSDs, Labradors, Huskies, etc.), beware of the sizing.I resolve to buy unmatchable of these muzzles for my IX month onetime German sheepman for when he endure to the ex-serviceman. The sizing information on the packaging and the website are all manner off so one didn't really grow to essay it out. They both suggest a size III for GSDs, but in reality, the size 3 is half of what my dog would need. And my dog is standard size, so he's not over-sized or anything.I returned this and ordered a Size 4XL. Hopefully that will fit.$LABEL$0,1,1
slap-up price and functionality.. I was looking for a compact electric kettle that would be good for travel. The Proctor Silex K2070Y 1 Liter Electric Kettle was the best choice I could find, and the damage was very attractive. It is a very useful and mostly well-designed unit. whippersnapper, compact, tardily to see the water level, slow to see the "on" light, and fast. Two and a half minutes to a boil (filled at the minimum level; enough for one large cup). The only down side is the on-off trigger sticks up and might break off during travel, and the pouring screen (inside the spout) is not very secure. It has come loose several times inside the pot. All-in-all, a very good product.$LABEL$1,1,0

Great guide but needs updating. This book is excellent for both the novice and experienced eBayer alike. Everyone who uses eBay regularly should be able to direct something away from this book.As a previous reviewer has stated, some of the tips are common sense, and come straight off the ebay site. However, its great to have these tips in one place and easily referenced. This can serve as a checklist for your own buying and selling procedures.PS: Second edition has now been released. crap sure you are buying the new one.The one big negative - no coverage of the latest 'bid sniping software'. This automates your bidding, allows better planning, does not increase the sell value early in the auction and maximizes the chance of winning (by placing a bid in the last seconds of auction). This software isn't highly publicized by ebay.This is a great book, but look out for newer texts covering the latest auction software.$LABEL$1,1,0

FOR COLLECTORS lonesome. This 1955 effort for Prestige is marred for me by vocalizing on 2 tracks and rather loud congo playing from Candido on several others.

A commodity Knot Book. This book gives clearly illustrated instructions on tying many very useful knots. It organizes them under headings of Sailing, Hiking and Climbing in which they are most commonly used. The author includes the strength of most of these knots which describes how much they weaken the lines in which they are tied - often leaving less than 50% of the original strength of the line! Some knots do not hold well when bending (you will learn the definition of this term, as well as "hitch" and "knot") together two ropes of unequal size. Maybe you should use a different knot? Budworth has a suggestion!This book is both useful and interesting thanks to the inclusion of a brief history of each knot. It did not change my life, but it did change how I secure my anchors! I recommend it!$LABEL$1,1,0

Time Travel & Pseudo-Scientific vernacular. clip locomote and what-have-beens are among my favorite eccentric of book. Highly recommended are Anderson's TIME PATROL, Piper's LORD KALVAN or Dann's TIMESHARE series.However, Mr. Parkinson has acquire a plot with a minimal storyline, characters with blur pasts, presents and futures, a knowledge of history which would not do justice to a ten year sure-enough and glossed over this impurity with mathematical constructs and scientific jargon in a mish-mash of nihilism. Having received the enire series plus his TIMECOP work, the best I would note is that Mr. Parkinson's writing is of a consistent level -- unfortunately, that level is poor.$LABEL$0,1,1

non Very skilful!!. I was assigned to read "Define Normal" & if not for that, I wouldn't have finished it. I think the age level it was meant for doesn't match the age level that would actually enjoy it. I agree very much with the review that called it dry, it lacked emotion & any depth into the characters. I get it boring & corny. I just don't really think that the author really has much talent. It's not a book someone could really get into. The only positive thing about it is that it's easy & fast to read, only I think a 4 year old could read it. Nope, I would say, don't waste your time & money.$LABEL$0,1,1
Fun, but does NOT contain words that you can use every day. I actually purchased the day calendar that was produced from this book by Jeffrey Kacirk. The information he provides about each word is fascinating and wonderful! However, this is a book good of words that are forgotten for a reason...they are no longer of much use to those living in our times! Some could be used, but most refer to things that are no longer in use, or to issues or items that we no longer have knowledge of. For instance, there are many words that refer to horses as a means of transportation--since we rarely use them in this manner, the words are not functional for our society.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history or etymology, but not to those who, like me, are looking for words to add to their current vocabulary. I enjoy the information, but that enjoyment is soured by my dissapointment in not finding words that I can actually use from day to day.$LABEL$0,1,1

I wasn't sure where it was coming from, but it was near.After I arrived home, I looked at my watch to see the lechatelierite was cracked right down the middle.

bonny exemplary. Okay, okay, how do I order this nicely? This record is all but unclear. Period. But not for the reason(s) you might think. The author is British. I am a not, and frankly, half the time while toiling through this book, I didn't have a clue as to what this writer was talking about. You see, that's because the book is written a la "British humor". British humor combined with late 20th century British slang terms, references, in-country gossip, yada, yada,yada. It's a book written by a Y2K Brit for fellow Y2K Brits. While his stories of previous Tour races are interesting and well written, so much of the rest of the book, like I said before, had me more than once thinking, "What is this guy talking about??"All you Anglophiles can turn up your noses if you wish, but I personally would not recommend this book.

I Beg to Differ. I thought BASIL was an intriguing film - a classical tale of revenge gone wrong. I couldn't figure out why it was shit R though, since there are no sex scenes, and less violence than what is found in most contemporary films.I didn't rule it dull at all, so I guess iodine will be unitary of the few people who soundly enjoyed this film.

The Rippingtons ~ [Rippin'] Live Across America!. ane have listened to many traditional and contemporary malarky artists, but none inspire me like The Rippingtons.I bought this after seeing it on the shelves and listening to euphony samples. All of the tracks are performed live, with 9 of them being remixes of some of their previously recorded work, 3 of them being remixes of well-known songs by other artists, and 2 being altogether new, never-been-heard before songs.And it is for the one song, "Road Warriors," that I bought this CD. The electric guitar, and just the whole arrangement of the song, is just so POWERFUL and MOVING. "Are We There Yet?" the second new song on the disc, simply sounds like a more mellow version of "Road Warriors," following the same melody.Sure, the other performances were good, but nothing special if you've already heard them before on their previous CDs; they're just done with that much better instrumentation this time around.$LABEL$1,1,0

I sense corresponding this film was really trying to button "Pro-Abortion" down my throat, and not very subtley. They are using richly drama and emotions to prove to influence those who question allowing abortions as a "convenience" for a woman. Very few women have abortions due to life threatening situations. In reality, most abortions are a matter of convenience. menstruation. Why not be honest about it ??? I wouldn't recommend this film, but if you are really pro-abortion, you would probably like it.

Kinobe - Soundphiles. Kinobe's first album, SOUNDPHILES, finds them raiding the crates for all sorts of samples and influences, from the neo-spaghetti Western of "Hombre" to the voodoo funk of "Bayou Barrataria." Some right okay downtempo on display here, probably best exemplified by the crummy listening classic, "Slip Into Something." It makes you feel sexy just listening to it. In some grade, though, there's a bit too much reliance on samples to carry the track, such as "The Biological Break" or just plain outright silliness from a mediocre M.C., such as "Theatricks." But when they stick to smooth downtempo grooves, they're on fine ground: the lazy country vibes of "Bopalong" or the blissful "Lucidity" which suddenly kicks into house gear or the through-and-through calm of "Hammock Island." Slip into something comfortable and enjoy this album.$LABEL$1,1,0
smashing base!. These bags are gross for storing milk in the fridge or the freezer. Based on other reviews I was skeptical to buy them because of the leaking issue, but i've only had one bag leak on me ever and i've been exclusively breast feeding/pumping for 7 months now and have used these bags since the beginning. I registered for them because they held the most milk. The bags that I freeze, I usually only put 6-7 oz max in each one so they will lay flat. However I keep milk in these bags in the fridge also and will sometimes put up to 10 oz in each bag. You can fit 12 oz like someone said but then the bag is hard to zip and even harder to pour the milk out of without spilling so I just stick with 10 oz. I highly recommend them!! They also don't leak or anything while pouring milk into a bottle which is great!! This is something I keep buying over and over!$LABEL$1,1,0

Jeffrey Wright is an underrated actor, wish we could see more of him. when the movie came out, i think on hbo, there was a negative critique given to this movie from a magazine that I supported. because of the critique, i wouldn't give this movie the time of day. i moldiness enunciate how wrong they were!!! this is an excellent movie and i no longer go by the reviews of others, i form my own opinion. will definitely add this movie to my collection.$LABEL$1,1,0
flash Than TurboTax, But non Worth It. I used Turbo Tax for many years and every year it got better and better. Then one seek Tax emasculated for two years in a run-in and was storm how much gawky of a platform it was to apply. I yet ran into situations where I had to override TaxCut's built in methods to get certain things done correctly. I've never had to do so with Turbo Tax. iodine finally publish on my file folder where I collect receipts for the coming tax years "Do Not Buy Tax Cut" so that I wouldn't forget.If you are doing a simple tax return then almost any software will do, but if you have a more complex return with rental properties, investments, trusts or anything else beyond normal wage and salary income and the common deductions then TurboTax is IMO the way to go.If your needs are fairly straightforward, then saving a few bucks by getting TaxCut might be OK.$LABEL$0,1,1
Sucks. This album truly suction, and that's all I got to say about that. Well first of all, the academia wants to pass this guy as a rocker, which he is not, he is straight up pop. Rockers write their own songs, they don't rip off other people's songs.$LABEL$0,1,1

slap-up Music!. This has a lot of party music which is good for parties and a couple of slow songs. "Get the Party Started" has a great beat and great singing. "Don't Let Me Get Me" is another great song and says that you shouldn't let people try to change. If you like party music you'll love this CD. that is all, Good-bye.$LABEL$1,1,0

The LCD screen breaks easily & not worth the cost to fix. Same as others with the breaking LCD screen what a bummer they should do some sort of testing with pressure placed on the screen and have to meet a minimum force to break. ace like the camera other than that. Slim and foresightful lasting battery user well-disposed It would have cost $130 to send back and replace the screen I can get a new one on e bay for that so i won't corrupt Olympus cameras any more. I am going to try Sony now.$LABEL$0,1,1

A commodity looking, working tea kettle. What is there to say about a tea kettle? it handles the tea making just fine. The design is overall appealing, especially since I have matching teacups from another company. Like another review said, this comes with a removable whistle over the spout, not the lever.Cons: Besides the lack of the lever from the picture, the whistle is not very loud at first, so take that as a pro or con as you see fit.Also, the whistle is not going to work unless you completely close the top of the lid, and properly secure the whistle to the spout. Otherwise the steam just flows out random openings and does nothing.Only other downside is that the top of the kettle is kind of hard to remove, especially if you can only grip the little black nob due to heat.Overall, a working, good looking, teakettle, but I bought this for about half price. I wouldn't suggest it for its normal price though. If your going to spend over fifty dollers for a kettle, make sure its one you want.$LABEL$1,1,0
