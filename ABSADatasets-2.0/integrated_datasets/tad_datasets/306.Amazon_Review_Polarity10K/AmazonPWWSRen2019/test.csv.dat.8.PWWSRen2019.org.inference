Very good!!!. Great information about the breed. This is not just another "one size fits all" dog book with the same doggy content and different breed photo on the cover. Scotties have an unique personality and need understanding.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Missing pin?. Maybe I'm just stupid and should have realized this from the acronyms in the product description, but there is a pin that is not wired in this cable. This pin happens to be the signal that tells my laptop hardware info on the monitor I attach to... so when I hook this cable to my Samsung DLP HDTV that has a VGA port, my laptop can only assume its a generic VGA monitor and displays in resolutions that don't fit on my HDTV (like 1024x768.) I tried another VGA cable I had that has all the pins wired, and my laptop immediately recognizes the display as a Samsung HDTV and defaults to a 720p resolution. Since the purpose of purchasing this cable was to hook up to my HDTV, this cable is useless to me.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Sound great but flimsy. Will not last.. I tried the cheaper in ear noise cancelling Sony earphones and they broke in a very short amount of time. I figured the more expensive version would be more durable. I WAS WRONG. These broke in an even shorter amount of time - 2 weeks. $50 is a lot to spend on disposable headphones. I guess Sony makes all of their products disposable; portable CD-players, stereos, etc. Sony customer service also sucks. Pray you'll never have to deal with them. Better yet, just don't buy Sony and go with Shure. It is more but worth it because it will last. Buy from a company that doesn't believe in disposable products.$LABEL$0,0,-100
CD player does not work. Just got this as a X-mas gift for my wife and the CD player now can only play one song before it says there is no disk. I am returning it for another brand.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Hilariously Bad. Hokey, cliched, comically terrible and an absolute joy for any B Movie lover to watch. An amazingly hard to track down film,as well, I discovered. .$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not Happy. This cleaning machine worked great when it was brand new and I left it sit just as the instructions say so it is always ready to use. Then one day I wasn't getting any solution spraying out and I had a real mess to clean up! I took everything apart I could including the pump and cleaned it but it still doesn't spray. I give up!$LABEL$0,0,-100
This is how music is supposed to be.... McLachlan is astounding! Her voice combined with the cleverly written lyrics are emotionally charged; something that is rare with many female artists, specifically mainstream.I first heard Sarah when her song, "I Will Remember You", was played in a video montage of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Captivated by her beautiful voice, I wanted to hear more. Thinking that "I Will Remember You" was a track on Surfacing, I purchased the album. You'd think I'd be disappointed to find out it wasn't, but I was highly satisfied with the mistake I made! I immediately fell in love with almost song (with the exception of "I Love You").The lyrics are dark, deep, & oddly unique, McLachlan's voice it haunting, both making Surfacing so damn good.This album is highly recommended.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great hands on instructor. I have watched Mark do LIVE trades using some of the indicators reviewed in this DVD set. He is very knowledgeable in options and futures trading. If you apply the information on just the inertia indicator, you will gain an edge in your trading.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Only for serious Akkerman fans. I bought this as a CD in 2012, forgetting that I had owned it as a vinyl LP in the late 70s. If I had remembered, I would not have bought it again. I DO like the final 7 short songs of the album: some blues-rock that sounds improvised; also a jig and a couple medieval pieces that are cool but not as well developed as some similar works that appeared on Focus 3, Hamburger Concerto, and Akkerman's album Tabernakel. HOWEVER, the first cut, "Fresh Air", is a tedious, 20 minute example of one of those 1970s unsuccessful attempts to elevate rock music to a higher art form. Yes, there are some impressively-fast guitar licks which are instantly recognizable as Jan Akkerman. But, otherwise, I find the song unlistenable; beginning and end are dreary, noisy chaos in between. Quite a bipolar album!$LABEL$0,0,-100
a vital and reliable companion to u.s. history today. This volume contains entries that deal with concepts, events, persons, and movements in u.s. history. The length of the entries is appropriate to the topic considered. In addition, the entires both inform the reader with up-to-date information and indicate how revisionist historians have resahped opionions or refocused the discipline. The entries are clearly written and eminently readable. They are persuasive in thier opionions, yet respectful of other stances. The cross references are helpful and ample. The same obtains for the bibliographies. The Oxford Companion to U.S. History far surpasses some other contemporary dictionaries in U.S. history. Its articles are treated in more depth and greater nuances. The entries in the other dictionaries are too short and far too superficial. I would highly recommend this for people involved in serious historical study and research.$LABEL$1,0,-100
yawn fest. This series is incredibly lame and boring! Not worth the money, especially since there are only 10 episodes! I do not recommend this series, and it's not often I say that!$LABEL$0,0,-100
worked great. until it broke.. It worked great. Until it broke. It fell into the tea kettle while I was boiling water and it stopped working. Sure... maybe it's not meant to be boiled... but considering what it's designed to do, one would think it could survive 185 degree temps for 5 seconds (that's how long it took to fish it out)! I'd imagine if the seal around the thermometer's face was better, it'd be fine. But, it's not. The word "disposable" comes to mind regarding all these cheap thermometers.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great Literature. Friends who had tried this book were divided - one thought it was great, another thought it was too "dark". I found it moving and beautiful - the plot grows out of the people's characters, and they are sympathetic people.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Falls apart quickly!. I got this mat a couple months ago and practice in a studio twice a week.Now there are peeled spots where my feet land in downward dog! The material peels off!

Nice but very unsafe design. I must agree that the set is very cute and this is what made us keepping it even with doubts about its design and quality. After just a few days of using it, my 2.5 years old leaned backward and broke the back of the chair. She is only 25 lb and did not do anything that the child of this age does when is sitting in the chair. I find this set is very unsafe and will not recommend to anyone.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great followup to excellent first movie. Couldn't pass up buying this movie when it was dirt cheap at $10!Iron man is one of my sons favorite action stars and he watches the first two movies over and over.I like the overall story, think it was a great follow up to first movie, and cant wait for the next one due out 2013.$LABEL$1,0,-100
I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This book has infuriated me! You know why? The author is sympathetic to the hijackers of Flight PK 326, especially Arshad. My family and I were aboard that flight and I can tell you by their actions on that plane, that they do not deserve anyone's sympathy. If that's not enough, half the book is written on heresay and facts that, in no way, the author could have witnessed. This book is a sham. Do me a favor and take your money elsewhere.$LABEL$0,0,-100
