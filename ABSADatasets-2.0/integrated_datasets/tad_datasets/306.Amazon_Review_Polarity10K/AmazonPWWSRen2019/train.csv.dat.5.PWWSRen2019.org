A must see!. Harry Chapin's finest work was writing the songs for this rollicking musical introduction to the modern day gospel of Luke, telling of the birth of Jesus in the great state of Georgia.Tom Key changes from one delightful character to another with ease. The quartet of musicians supporting him were brilliant on their instruments as well as fine actors, often comedic. "Spitball Me, Lord, Over the Home Plate of Life" is one funny song!)You will laugh, cry, and gasp as you see the Gospel through new eyes. Enjoy! Share it with everyone who will sit and listen.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Nearly Perfect Album From A Nearly Perfect Songwriter. Neil Finn comes closer to perfection in his craft then nearly anyone writing music today. When he is on, he is DEAD ON. Penning lovely melodies with lyrical content to match. This, his first solo effort, is a collection of his latest gems and with it he reminds us of why his fans love him. It also, however, nudges some to wonder what he does with all the rocking stuff he writes, as this album only comes close to moving your feet once (My Loose Tongue). As far as I'm concerned, that's more than enough as this is close enough to perfection for me. Keep 'em coming Neil.$LABEL$1,0,-100
High pitched whine, defective design. Don't buy one of these until they fix what must be a design flaw. As others have noted, there is a high pitched whine audible whenever the box is switched on. It's there regardless of whether any music is playing or not. This is almost certainly a design flaw. It could be aliasing noise, a leaky carrier tone, etc.XM is an interesting concept, but this boombox is poorly implemented.$LABEL$0,0,-100
The Wolf Master. Well being that I'm from a rather rough part of Wisconsin. My gang resides in the grimiest trailer park eva. Before heaven sent us the amazing tshirt. My gang was the 11th most rowdy gang in the trailer park. Since then we jumped straight up to number 2. Being that the number one gang actually has real wolfs named Kito and Keloy that they raised since baby wolfs. Tshirts is second best.Be aware of knock offs. To ensure authenticity the shirt should fade to grey in just 1 wash! I don't know why they just didn't make the shirt in grey like wolfs colors. To get maximum dudage I recommend cutting off the sleeves, don't worry the value of the shirt will not go down by doing this, but is will increase your Poon level. [...] I even had this one 11 year olds father give me and his daughter tickets to a Miley Sirus concert in trade to wear my 3 wolfs t shirt for the night.

Jim Morrison ....buried again...by Bruce Botnick. I am wondering who let John Densmore mix these tracks? Morrison's vocals are almost left off...they are so reduced in this new mix...just horrible..and the drums are now the lead instrument...just awful. A wonderful selection of tracks...reMASTERING would be great but reMixed? WHY? and if so..why didn't anybody mention that Jim's voice was the defining instrument of the band...when he died...so did the band.

A bit unrealistic but good. Very quick reading, I was 3/4 of the way through and felt I had just started reading it. Tim LaHaye always does a great job of developing characters and situations.

cute but poorly made. Aesthetically, this umbrella is just fine, and still looks good after 3 months of use so far. My problems with it: 1) The picture makes it look like a base comes with it. Nope- you have to purchase one separately, and there's no guidance on which type to get. Don't get the Verdi Gras cast iron stand, this umbrella is too thin to fit properly into it. So it leans a bit to the left. Not a huge deal.2) Whenever I crank it closed, it somehow manages to pinch and cut my hand, even if I'm trying to be careful3) If you're dumb enough, like me, to leave it open on a windy day, it blows over, taking your table and umbrella stand with it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Best Rush Album Yet. This is my second review. My first one was over 8 months ago. I just want to say that Vapor Trails has become my favorite Rush album (which by default makes it my favorite album). It would have been inconceivable to me that Rush could do better than Moving Pictures, Hemispheres or Fairwell to Kings. Hold Your Fire was the the last really great Rush album for me (although I do like all the ones that followed except maybe Presto). Vapor Trails has turned it all around again. I just hope they keep releasing albums. Anyone that can't hear the genius in this album just hasn't given it a chance. Play the full album 10 times and then decide.$LABEL$1,0,-100

this is a great book. I am buying this book after lending out my original copy to new dog owners so many times that I finally lost it. This is a very clear, concise dog training book.

Bought 2, both are broken within a week. My dog's barking seemed to decrease within a few uses of this product, that's why after the first one broke after only a week I ordered a replacement. The first one sprayed the Citronella as soon as it was refilled, even when on the off button, and the second one we used for one day, I went to refill it, and nothing happened when I blew on it to test it. I exchanged the battery just in case, used a different refill bottle, and nothing! One week for the first, 1 day for the second!!!!!

Great for this Breastfeeding Mother. I love this sterilizer. I am a breastfeeding mother and use the Avent Isis to pump milk from time to time. This sterilizer fits the Isis perfectly along with a few bottles, nipples and sealing discs. I wash my bottles out after I use them and put them away. When I'm ready to pump, I load this up and 7 minutes later I'm good to go. You don't need to dry the bottles or pump before using, if you use them right away. When I'm done, I wash my pump and store it back in here to dry. It stays there until I'm ready to use it again. I've never tried sterilizing any other bottles but the instructions specify how to place others in here so they fit well. It is very time saving, rinses easily, and works very well. I'm glad I've never had to resort to the boiled water on the stove.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Carol is that great singer, we have been looking for. Carol Sloane really knows how to sing JAZZ. She seems to be a natural at this venue. Her voice is really smooth and nice to listen to.For this project Carol used Bill Charlap as pianist and arranger. I must say Bill did a good job wearing both hats. Also Carol has a lot of fine sidemen that contributed to this cd. I think we need to give the musicians for this project a hand of applause.The down side to this cd was that some of the arrangements I didn't like and feel that they worked very well. All and all I would say this was a worth while cd.Recommendation: I would like to recommend this cd.$LABEL$0,0,-100
I've been guzzling this stuff for years, excellent tasting shakes with good blend of essentials. Does it taste like a great milkshake? No, but it is very good. I usually mix it with 8oz milk, about 3oz water and 3oz ice. It makes a more liquidy shake that is much easier to drink. I think the recommended mixture makes it a bit too thick. Taste is a good vanilla flavor and there is very little aftertaste other than the sweetener used. Its definitely filling and works well post workout.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The Last Fairy Tale of Fantasy from the Vietnam War. This well written, but poorly researched fantasy piece should have been labeled as a novel in my opinion. Ten POWS died of starvation, mistreatment, and torture in Garwood's camp; none of them crossed over to the enemy. To know the real Bobby Garwood, read Frank Anton's "Why Didn't You Get Me Out?" or Zalin Grant's "Survivors," plus several more POW narratives that are out of print but still may be found at major libraries. If you are still inclined to believe the best in Garwood, look up his name or "Garwood Papers" on the POW/MIA Database on the Library of Congress's website, and you'll discover a ton of material that will change your mind$LABEL$0,0,-100

Refreshingly different.. I'm not a big romance reader. But this book caught my eye and something told me to give it a chance.I'm glad I did. It truly was a memorable story. The most striking part of it all to me was the starkly poignant way the author tackled the issue of human-reliance. She showed how dangerous it is to rely on a mere person for your happiness. People always fail people. We were made to love each other, not to hang on each other. No one is strong enough to carry both their issues and your issues on their shoulders, no matter how sure they may be of the otherwise.Yup... a pretty neat story... and a potentially life-saving lesson.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A Mystery Buffs Dream Weekend. This is a tribute to Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler, all rolled into one neat murder mystery. Bernie and Carolyn spend the weekend in a New England guesthouse, which attempts to replicate an authentic old English manor. When guests begin showing up murdered, it's Bernie who plays the part of Hercule Poirot or, if you like, Philip Marlowe, as he gathers the clues, which will hopefully lead him to the murderer before too many more guests are knocked off. Being a guesthouse, there are suspects aplenty delivering us ample opportunity to figure out the mystery ourselves. If mystery fans will be delighted by this book, then fans of the British crime story will be even more so. Combining the wit and humour of Lawrence Block with the traditional murder mystery creates a deadly weekend, though presented in a light and breezy manner.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Superficial attempt at wit. Excited to read a book from an under-represented member of the "Beat Generation", I plowed into The Dud Avacado with relish.... and was sorely disappointed. Unlike contemporary Kerouac's On the Road, The Dud Avocado sadly lacks spiritual, moral, or intellectual development. The primary character starts out as superficial, vain, and unbelievably gullible. Unfortunately, though she miraculously scrapes through disasters of her own creation, she never grows as a person.I too was twenty once and I too did many stupid things.

Great stand, strong enough for our windy days. This is a very heavy, durable umbrella stand. However, reading the reviews, I was prepared that it wouldn't exactly fit our smaller umbrella. It did not. We had to "fatten" our umbrella handle up a bit to make a tight fit, and after we did, it's great. We have very windy days here and the porch it is on is in direct line of the high winds.

Good story overcomes perceived flaws. For sheer escapist adventure of the romantic variety, this book is a winner. There's quite a bit of anachronism in dialogue and character behavior, and those who are familiar with Spanish may be put off by abysmal usage of that language (misspellings like "buenas dias" and "bandeleros" stand out -- repeatedly). Horsey terms, too, take an occasional hit ("gruello"?). Some of the plot points require extreme suspension of disbelief.

Preaching to the Choir: Anti-Mormonism for Evangelicals. I downloaded this because it was free. From the title, I knew it was an expose of Mormonism. It is, but only as contrasted to the author's original Christian faith. As a secularist, I found nothing shocking about the mainstream Mormon church--just some weird Masonic-like stuff and self-important old men. The author seems to have joined for the social aspects and then quit when it turned out to be hard. I slogged through the first half. The second half, which describes the author's ministry, I skimmed. This book obviously appeals to those who share Ms. Robertson's beliefs, but just seemed like propaganda to me.$LABEL$0,0,-100

VIDEO EROTICA. Why don't we just admit it? TA videos and songs are the equivalent to the hottest of EROTIC FICTION.The only women who will not like this are the ones who are uncomfortable with their own sexuality.The men (boys) that don't like this are threatened by the "romance". They could just sit back and enjoy the benefits of the arousal (i.e. no work on their part) of their woman.$LABEL$1,0,-100
workout. My husband and I used this for the first time tonight. We had a huge venison roast and put it through the grinder very easily. Although, I could definitely see how a motor would simplify matters, we still went through it in less than an hour (which includes cleaning it up post-grinding, and taking care of our cranky children). I would recommend this to others. This one hasn't been as impressive as some motored ones I have been around, but it did the job efficiently, was easy to clean, and didn't get my kitchen messy with "goo" everywhere. You will want a workbench or something similar to bolt it down on.- One complaint, the packaging we received the grinder in was horrible. I am almost surprised we even got it because of the box being in such bad shape. Also, no manual included and the handle didn't survive the transit, so my husband had to make one. These aren't devastating factors, but are annoying.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Could be a good book... just don't try to do the practice problems.. Why the $%&* would you list a homework problem under section 4.4 when you wouldn't know how to do it without reading section 4.5? This has thrown off my whole study strategy that has served me extremely well in every science class (physics, math, chemistry) I've taken up to this point, college or high school. Basically, you read a section, and then do the practice problems for that section BEFORE moving onto the next. I just wasted 2 hours of valuable finals study time reading sections 1.1 through 4.4 looking for the solution, only to turn 2 pages ahead after giving up to find the necessary information right there... words cannot express how enraged I was after discovering this and I hope this review will save some others from lighting their book on fire and throwing it out the window like I almost just did.$LABEL$0,0,-100

In flight confusion. This is by far the worst language-related product I have ever purchased. This CD assumes that you can learn a language by memorizing long, complicated phrases by rote with no foundation whatsoever in vocabulary or grammar. It is just not possible to remember long setences relating to travel without first learning anything about the basic grammar of a language. The phrases aren't even repeated or broken down. This CD might be useful if you have already taken some modern Greek and want to brush up on travel phrases. Otherwise save your money -- most Greeks who work in airports and hotels speak English and this CD won't help you have much of a conversation with anyone who doesn't.$LABEL$0,0,-100
enjoy ... while they last. I can't argue with the sound quality (although you definitely hear contact with the wire -- probably unavoidable with a light-weight wire).More troubling is that they simply don't survive normal use. The wire is too light-weight & didn't last even a year before one ear starting cutting out. I nearly always placed the headphones back in their carrying case after use.

I just found this one very hard to follow and I don't like having to work that hard trying to keep up with a story line.

A knife is of no use if...... I will just echo much of what "The Shepard" said about the knife. It's almost impossible to remove it from the sheath without playing tug of war with yourself. And to make a strange situation even more strange, the belt/boot clip that is an integral part of the sheath is so weak that it is useless for holding the knife in any location.....which is why I no longer own this knife. Rideing my motorcycle today, the knife fell away somewhere on I40. I don't miss it....Lynn Stubblefield$LABEL$0,0,-100

A resource to be treasured. If we're lucky enough not to have a chronic disease with difficult symptoms, P.S. Julia is an interesting, moving, humorous read, and a resource to share with those who are struggling with such a condition.

I didn't want an apple taco.... I generally love these Sunbelt products. They are tasty and healthy and that is a wonderful combination. Sadly, these bars have a distinct taste that is off-putting and really makes them less than wonderful in my eyes. The outer shell smells and tastes like a wheat tortilla. I'm not joking.

It sounded so good on the back cover.... I first read this book over three years ago and didn't like it. But then, a few weeks ago, I decided to see how much my taste in books had matured and gave it another chance. Big mistake! I hate this book! They took a wonderful concept and blew it to smithereens by ruining Giles and Xander. I would have felt better if they'd somehow discovered that the real Giles and Xander had been locked in a warehouse for the duration of this novel and had been replaced by cyborgs because only that could explain why the heck they were saying such stupid stuff!Not only were they horrible, but the supposed climax of the novel - the zombie diner fight scene - was over waaay too fast and easily. It completely and irreparably damaged my spirit. The books only saving grace was some fun quips from the Buffster and a sweet (albeit, paranormal) kiss between Willow and Xander at the very end. I would recommend Coyote Moon and Halloween Rain in a heartbeat over this book.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Buy, Capitalist!. With most bands, you only get one version of a specific song. Occasionally, extended mixes, remixes, live or demos show up.

This is Manson's best album yet!. This is Manson's best album yet. Unlike Antichrist Superstar he sings about things that affect all of us. He constantly is reminding us that drugs do run our society. "The Dope Show" is the best song on the album. But the others are not far behind. In his past albums Manson constantly screamed his lyrics. This happens only a few times in "Mechanical Animals". I particulary like the song that has a 70's sound and backup singers.

A wall of sound to knock you to your knees. Cop Shoot Cop's second release on Big Cat records yields more of the same style as Consumer Revolt. Rythmic and driving arrangements that swell into blistering choruses. The songs on this album are even arranged in such a dramatic way that it is hard to stop the album once you start it. Each song becomes a prelude to the next in a fashion that almost plots out a twisted and spiraling story of loss, contempt and despairity with a smart and cynically sharp hatred toward just about everything. Imagine Tom Waits crossed with Einsturzende Neubauten.It will leave you unsatisfied, you just can't get enough.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A dazzling debut. The short stories in this impressive debut collection are populated with characters who will stay with you long after you've finished reading. From the comic book artist obsessed with a lost love in "Have You Seen Her" to the title character in "Mr. Lillicrop's Shining Moment" -- the most dignified drunk you'll ever meet -- the people of Kulpa's fiction find hope while dancing on the edge of hopelessness.

Lugubrious..... A very unsatisfying book with a very interesting setting. The portrait of the immediate aftermath of WW2 in Berlin is excellent but the story is drawn out much longer than necessary.

You don't expect a story set in war-devastated Berlin to be a boffo laff riot but you can expect some spirit, some elan and energy.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A dull primer on nonduality. If you've seen "What the [bleep]" and found it revelatory, you might find this book moderately useful/interesting.Otherwise, particularly if you've ever read any book about Eastern philosophy/spirituality, you're liable to find this a painfully dull, repetitive, dry, and uninformative read.I can sum it up as follows: "Aristotle - bad! Nagarjuna - good! Non-duality, token reference to Buddha/Jesus/Eastern mystic, unintentionally reductionistic reference to quantum physics or psychic research, blah blah blah, endnote."The authors are presumably quite nice people and I hope my viewpoint doesn't cause them any unnecessary suffering...but they should really stick to academia rather than mainstream publication.$LABEL$0,0,-100
profound and powerful--don't miss it!. A SIDEWAYS LOOK AT TIME is a gem of a book. Jay Griffiths combines the wisdom and humility of Ivan Illich, the anger at social injustice and word magic of Eduardo Galeano, the senstivity and compassion of Terry Tempest Williams and the sense of wonder of John Muir into a text that challenges the time and productivity obsessed world of consumer society. Take time to read this book; its depth, and Griffiths' erudition, sharp wit and incisive social critism can't be fully appreciated by skimming it. As the book makes clear, the road to (social and ecological) hell is paved with "time-saving" devices and the worldview that "time is money." Perhaps this book will eventually be seen as a manifesto for the growing "slow life movement" now taking root around the world. Even when I disagreed with Griffiths, which wasn't often, the power of her prose and her arguments forced me to think hard about my own views. You can't ask for more from a book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Comprehensive View. As in her book on Instinctual Subtypes, Ms. Chernick-Fauvre, has provided the reader with the added visceral dimension of learning beyond a dry portrait of each subtype.

An experienced look. I tried not to be overly objective and I also attempted to be open to the contents of this book, I still found some things very hard to swallow. I have not yet fully completed my reading, but I will tell you this...Satanism is not a mental disease. The mental disease area belongs to those who think as this book reads. I have been a Satanist my entire adult life. But to tell me that I have a mental disease not a relgion is just the same as saying that all Christians and Catholics are diseased. If you do read this book, just remember...those who write about what they do not know spead a sead of misinformation and seads of the brain if used unwisley can be very distructive.

Legend of the Monk and the Merchant. This book was an easy read with 12 principles discussed in a storytelling manner. I received this book from BookSneeze and finished the book within 2 days.

Works with reservation. This pump is a step backwards from the previous two battery version (this one has three batteries). The additional battery make it too heavy on the top so it doesn't sit well in the pot. It has a tendency to tip over, or at least shift from the position you set it at.I would agree with some of the other reviews that it seems to loose power after the first use. The thicker the oil, the harder a time it has. If you heat the oil before filtering, it works much better. Note that you don't want to get the oil too hot - perhaps nothing hotter than 100 degrees. I cracked the clear tube in my old two-battery one by running boiling water through it (requiring the purchase of this model).If you can find the older version, I highly recommend it, but the three battery version is definately a step backwards.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Nothing Original. I own every domestic Esbjorn Svensson Trio album and this is the first one to disappoint me. With each of their other albums there are songs that are truly unique in composition, sounds and performance. However, this album is missing that innovation. To me, this album sounds like it was made by taking a handful of older, mediocre EST songs, dropping them in a blender and mastering what comes out. It sounds rehashed. The songs also aren't differentiated from each other, so it's not very noticeable when one song ends and another begins.$LABEL$0,0,-100

The Best 90s Metal Album, period.. That's right, kiddies, you read correctly. This album, Devy's second endeavour unattached to Vai's apron strings into the big bad world of extreme metal, is a masterpiece on every level. Nine tracks of sheer neck-breaking metal. I still have not heard another album as heavy - and when I say heavy, I don't mean I haven't heard much metal. I HAVE heard Origin. I HAVE heard the Berzerker. They are heavy - VERY heavy: City is heavier, and I'll tell you why.This album has dynamics without ever losing the pace, intensity or insane yet calculated aura that most metal cannot replicate. This album sounds crazy when it's not and has a sound that not even black metal, death metal or a thousand blastbeats can imitate. A song like All Hail the New Flesh only comes along once in a metal half-life (something like 15 years, maybe). You don't have to concur. Listen for yourself. Redefine metal. City did.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Must Read !. This book is experiencing a rebirth among readers these days. I think that our growing concerns about America's current political and economic course are motivating many of us to learn more about our country's roots. And George is a great place to start.The last I heard much about George Washington was in elementary school. I remember the cherry tree story, but my knowledge of this gentleman was pretty sketchy beyond that. I had the impression that he was a good and honorable man, but again, I had few specifics.This book took care of that. This amazing man makes all of our contemporary Presidents pale in comparison.

Get her off the Nitrous Oxide!!!. Being a teenager in the Eighties I had enough of "Hey Micky" it was bad then and it's bad now. Avril was nothing but throw away pop on her first record, but her second record was like an entire other person and it was very good. This, This, This??This is terrible. Not just a let down, but a bad, bad record. The lyrics are strung-together cliches that required no effort, the music sounds programed and the style is pure, unadulterated, pop garbage. She stepped right in to fill the void left by Britany Spears, that's what she did. Also, it appears she is suffering from Fergie worship.Please, please, someone get her some Tori Amos, Alanis, Sarah McLachlan! Anything to stop her from recording this bland, boring tripe! Why waste the talent shown on the second record, why waste my time and money on this disk. I won't, I downloaded, I deleted. Bad, bad record by any standards.My teeth where rotting from listening to it, it's that sugary.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Same old same old.... I've been a fan of BLACK 47 from their first release. And I'm just obsessive-compulsive enough to have all of their CDs. After listening to "New York Town", I must say that I've heard it all before. Does Mr. Kirwin EVER change his singing style? I found his voice modulation and practice of forcing way-too-many words into just about every song irritating. Before the first song was over this thought went through my mind: Could I be playing ANY of the other BLACK 47 CDs?I've given considerable thought to this review. I've regarded the progression of other musical artists through their careers and how the evolutionary process either added to or detracted from their quality and attraction. In brief: change is good. BLACK 47 (aka Larry Kirwin) cannot or will not change. Therefore, my collection of BLACK 47 music must now, as of this latest offering, be considered complete.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Fun and Learn. With my eight year old son and infant daughter, I reviewed "Mandarin Chinese Beginning Level 1" presented by Language Tree. What amazes me the most is they make the language learning process entertaining, rather than the traditional way of "pain".Several songs throughout the video make the whole process fun! Literally, you can dance with the songs while you and your children are learning - that's what I did with my kids. The short sentences are easy to follow, and for every scene you get a quick review on what you just learned. The multiple story sessions are situations you bump into daily. It is amazing that all of the above is packed in just 30 minutes! I am waiting for Language Tree's next video to be produced.Martin LiuActivity Director (School Years 2003 - 2005)Board of San Diego Chinese AcademyLa Jolla, California$LABEL$1,0,-100

An Unusal Story for Preschoolers and Aspiring Scientists. In 1992, a crate of 29,000 rubber bathtub toys washed overboard off a ship bound from Hong Kong to Washington, USA. Hundreds of toys have since been found in coastlands around the world, shedding light on our understanding of how currents, winds and tides interact. This book traces the story of one bathtub toy from the time its crate boards the ship until it is found by a boy in Alaska. The story draws young readers in by personifying the toy as if it is experiencing its journey as a sentient creature. Caldecott Medal Winner David Wisniewski illustrates the story in cut-paper collage, skillfully rendering the dramatic power of the ocean without being too frightening. This is an unusual story that may not appeal to every reader, but for those who prefer "real" stories or who are interested in science, it's a sure winner. It's best suited for preschoolers and early elementary readers.$LABEL$1,0,-100
great scanner, highly portable. Great device for cutting down on paper clutter. Main uses for me are receipts (I create a PDF of all receipts from a single trip and zip it with the expense report), for business cards which I sync with Outlook and for general notes -- I never have to worry about having the right paper folder along on a trip.Outlook sync for business cards is great but could map more fields or allow user to adjust the maping.

Don't step in the Bleep, strictly for culties. What the Bleep Do We Know is like shoveling copious amounts of kitty litter down your throat, you may temporarily alleviate hunger, but at what cost? Can you possibly consume enough of that stuff to mask the giant turd, that was once your brain?For some people, keeping an open mind involves closing your eyes and following any appeal to your ego. The Universe does not, with baited breath, wait to see if you will rubberstamp it's continued existence, nor does it deal in polls to see where mankind's intention as a whole lay and adjust itself accordingly.This DVD will make jabbering chimpanzees out of many otherwise well intentioned individuals. Taking seriously the musings of Dr. Michel Ledwith, ( Pedarest ) and a she-male god(dess?) named Ramtha, in conjunction with discourse about quantum mechanics from a " Life Coach, " the good, " Dr " Joe Dispenza, will leave you staggering out the other end of the rabbit hole deaf, dumb, and blind.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great tool...but beware if you are a traveling engineer. I purchased the Cybertool because I am a traveling engineer and find that I need to open computer and networking equipment a lot when I'm on the road. The tool is great and very handy. I have only one complaint about the Cybertool...since I travel every week, I will not check bags (playing the odds by checking bags every week will definitely result in lost luggage many times a year) and the Cybertool will not pass through TSA security checkpoints. This makes the Cybertool useless for me. It would be nice if the Cybertool and all other Swiss Army knife models were listed in a matrix that showed which ones can be checked according to TSA security rules. This seems like it would be an easy task...perhaps that is a project I can work on sometime unless it already exists out there.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A variety of good & bad. If you can overlook some of the lamer episodes and just focus on the more plot-hole oriented episodes, you should find it interesting.Yes, one of the episodes is 'darker' in nature. Ponies are captured by dragons and turned into dragons by a centaur who keeps a throbbing 'dark' rainbow in a bag around his neck. Seeing the ponies in chains is sad, but not scary. My nieces & nephew (4, 6, & 8) LOVED this episode most of all and even began singing along with the seaponies halfway through the song!The rest of the episodes are all about friendship, helping one another, and saving the day. Sure, Crunch the Rockdog turned bushwoolies into stone, but they came back to life after he was cured of his stone-headedness. :D$LABEL$1,0,-100
Nice music - POOR SOUND !!!. There is not much I can say about Mike Rowland music. Simple melodic piano tunes with synthesizer strings. I like it and it's the reason I bought it.I originally had bought the "Fairy Ring" on tape, and quite recently I decided to buy it on CD too, to enjoy it on my just bought, multi $$$ thousand stereo system. The man who remastered the recording however (if anyone did at all), must have been deaf. The CD sounds as bad as(if not worse than) my worn-out tape cassete. I was thinking of buying "Titania" too on CD, but I probably won't after that. That's too bad for the music cause I honestly think it's worth it. I hope the "Fairy Ring Suite" sounds better.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Patterson simply stinks these days. I don't know why I bought this book; I've been less and less happy with Patterson's work.

Interresting. Like I'm 51 and not much into gothic/death metal. I recently met Christopher and because of that I bought the CD. These guys can play music! The female vocalist is very nice and the ballad, "Harlot" is very good. Chris does a nice job on the keyboards. My only complaint is the 'demon' voice that pops up in every song. I do think they could do an interresting cover of "Eleanor Rigby" though. I mentioned this to him and he said, "Wow! We have a list and that is one of the songs on it." So, maybe the next album will feature that famous Beatle tune. So, give this one a try. Curl up in front of the fire, but don't get scared when the demon sings.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Kindle edition is simply unusable. The ebook has no formatting at all. There are so many chapters packed with potentially good information and no way to get to them easily. A table of contents is included but doesn't include any links to jump to the relevant chapters. You just have to guess the location repeatedly to try and get to the point you want. There are no page numbers either which isn't unusual for an ebook but would help since the TOC is not linked.The book has too much potential information in it and it's simply not accessable in an ebook format unless you just love location guessing or endlessly flipping pages forward/backward. I don't know how good the content of the whole book is but the book is impossible to navigate. If the TOC became linked it would probably be great as an ebook but sadly it's not the case. Whoever put this out clearly just dumped a text file into the Amazon system without any thoughts to making it a reader friendly experience. I returned it for a refund.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not his best. I don't understand how the same author can write really good books (likeThe Shawshanke Redemption and The Green Mile) and then some really awful ones like Dreamcatchers and Kingdom Hospital, to name a couple. This book isn't one of the absolute worst he has written but it is a far cry from being good. I was able to listen to the unabridged CD version which I got at the library. I hadn't read a good book in a long time, so it was passable to listen to this one. If I had just read a good book, I am sure I would not have been able to get past disc one. My advice is to get this at the library if you think you want to read it. it isn't worth buying.$LABEL$0,0,-100

More like Prince of Sadness.... Ok, the first 2 CD's are good. Demos, live songs, etc... What else can you ask for? then you start listening to CD #3. Ummm, duets with rappers??? what the $#$@% was that??? come on, is true Ozzy is not out to please loyal fans but to make new ones. I agree with most reviewers, the price of the boxset is a bargain, but if I want to pay money to listen to Ozzy stuff, it BETTER be Ozzy stuff, not collaboration with others that is just crap. What's next? Maiden doing duets with Gwen Stefani? Oh please no...I'm a huge METAL fan...lets keep it that way...Bottom line, buy at your own risk. If you are an loyal Ozzy fan, you may not like it.

Effects, effects, effects. Jimi Hendrix! The guitar god! What a sham. Yes,Jimi Hendrix was one of the greatest guitarest that ever lived, but he wasn't a guitar revolutionary he was an effects revolutionary. He made the guitar sound weird with a wah-wah and fuzz, what's the big deal. To me this whole album is a jam using new "techniques" to ad an edge and that's it an edge. I'll admit many numbers get me going, but this album is no different from any other Moby Grape or Stepenwolf (not to say these bands are bad). By far though, the worst thing on this album are the lyrics, they're senseless readings of psychelic words and discriptions of drug trips. In fact I think the most revolutionary thing about this album is Mitch Mitchel's druming. I'm not saying the album is bad it's actually very good it's just one of the most over-rated albums ever.$LABEL$0,0,-100

But this was only in one little world, and hardly any levels or challenges. I would suggest you not get this game. It was really bad. The only thing that was good was the change in the quality of the graphics compared to the other games, and the extra special powers that Spyro gets. But to be honost, it's not worth having.

A Good Fit for My Purpose. One of the frustrating things with a study bible is the lack of margin space. This bible was specifically referred to me by a friend because they knew my frustration. You see, I "mark" my study bibles such that when I refer to my index that I place in the front of the bible listing subjects, and linking an initial text, the wide margins make it very easy to mark the next text to which I should refer on the same subject. With the additional space I can still make notes in the margin. This enables me to use my study bible for giving bible studies even when I don't have a "lesson" with me.$LABEL$1,0,-100

a gift for my inner nerd.. This was definiately an Impulse buy. I could have got the movies seperately for cheaper, but i have always wanted a puzzle box in one form or another and then I seen this.It came well protected in its retail packaging, but the box leaves something to be desired. Made of a cheap lightweight plastic it is noticably lighter than it looks. It gives off the impression that you can rotate the halves of the boxes and in essence "play" with the box, but that is not the case, as the halves only fit together in one way. When put together, the fingers of the box halves have nothing to be supported against at the tip and will flex inward.The movie quality is as others described it, and makes for an enjoyable experience.In all i'm still happy with the purchase, although I'll probably put the discs into a binder and add some weights to the box and glue it shut, to use as a paperweight of sorts.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Entertaining, but completely shallow. Hot chicks with bio-mod razor nails? Shallow characters, shallow world. None of the humor, quirkiness, and philosophical insights as authors like Philip K. Dick, Lem, or Alfred Bester. Mostly style, very little substance. If Cyberpunk were a type of Rock & Roll it'd be 80's glam, lipstick & hair bands. Oodles of D&D; Nerd 'Cool Factor'with hardly the philosophical intrigue of the highly derivative Matrix trilogy. While I'm sure this is blasphemy to the cyberpunk fans everywhere, the chip on my shoulder left by books like Neuromancer and Snow Crash is taking Geek Chic at face value, and realizing there's nothing behind the curtain--nothing beneath the sunken eyes of drug addicts and biotech junkies.More deserving of a comic book than a novel!

It gives a good description of the breed as a pet, what to expect and what would be expected of you - the prospective owner. I've read through other Shiba books and most of them are geared more for those who are interested in competition/dog-show/breed history. This book will save you 'surfing' on the net. I'm sure all those Shiba puppies will be grateful to this author for prepping their new owners!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Ok, but.... I spent some time with Dan Rios (aka Alom Ahau Tze'ec Ba'lam) and he is a sly and wily teacher of the "Mayan secrets." Over all the CD is ok. Dik Darnell is a talented musician and like any other CD there are tracks that are much better than others.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Ghost Story. This film is in my opinion, one of the best horror films I have seen. It is an old film based on the early 1900's, about some men who grow up suffering from guilt, over the death of a young girl. The story is entirely believable. I think that Alice Krige looks very beautiful, & the makeup is great also.$LABEL$1,0,-100
good insight into the cert. process. Perry uses extensive interviews with former clerks and Justices to gather his data on the cert. process in the United States Supreme Court. He presents the information in a very readable format that provides brings to light why some cases get heard and others don't. Ultimately he presents a decision making model that takes into consideration both the individual justices, the factors influencing cert., and the purpose of the Court. This book gives the reader a good look at the cert. process from the inside and from a non-legal perspective. It is a must read for any attorney thinking of writing a cert. petition. This book would be interesting for anyone interested in how the Supreme Court functions in our system of government.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Exceptional. Even though I am an long-time Kirk Whalum fan, in this CD, he has out done even himself. This is undoubtly one of the best CDs out today, and one of his best. The smooth style of the way he handles Babyface's music makes you want to listen to it over and over. We all know how rare it is that every cut on a CD is good, well, this is one of those rare ones. I liked it so much, that I went back and bought three of his old ones.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The Bible of Baseball Cards. If you collect baseball cards you absolutely must have this book. It catalogs virtually every baseball card ever made, including variations and errors.Why only four stars and not five? Subtle reasons, mostly. The main reason is that this book, despite being released recently, does not do a very good job of covering the professionally graded baseball card market. This is even more surprising as Beckett does have a grading service of their own. As such, the sections covering the history of baseball cards and how to grade cards is lacking and is pretty much a reprint of what's been appearing in Beckett books like this one for over fifteen years. They really could have done a better job of modernizing those sections.However, as a reference book to help identity cards and give approximate values, this book cannot be beat. Buy it now!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Good value for the price. I bought this tassel when some of my sword tassels started fray and to fall apart from age. It would be nice if more colors than just yellow were offered.This tassel is long enough and well enough made. It's far from the worst I've seen, but not as good as the best (Kung Fu Instruments). On the other hand, it's very convenient to get without having to do wire transfers to China.The only complaint I have, a minor one, is that the tassel is slightly on the heavy side. That means that it is less likely to wrap around your wrist if your hand gets too busy. That may be good for form competitions, but form competition isn't the reason I study.One piece of advice, the shipping cost for single pieces is outrageous. It just about doubles the price. The solution is to get together with your Jian class or practice partners and do a group buy. My study group just bought 15.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A useful book for the historian (military or pilot).. This book is more than just a manual in that it starts with a brief history of the P-61, then goes to the actual manual which emcompasses an introduction to aircraft systems, then basic operations from walk around check to flight characteristics to release of external stores. In this age of poorly written manuals I was surprised at how clear this manual is. It will add a dimension to your understanding of the P-61 unavailable in (but complimentary to) other sources. It will be appreciated by military historians and pilots (who could compare aircraft operations with their modern "twins"). Very "large scale" modelers might also find the detailed cockpit photos useful. If you are very interested in the Black Widow you should own this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

PATHETIC. I never knew it was possible to despise a kitchen appliance as much as I do this toaster. Take for example the frozen waffles I just pulled out of this thing and am now eating ~ one is nearly black on one side, nice and golden brown on the other. The second waffle is crisp but not brown at all on one side, and the other side is soggy...it's no longer frozen, just wet.Now maybe if this were a trend in how this thing "toasts", and if I really thought it was worth it, I could rotate the items being toasted when the cycle was half way done. BUT, it's never the same from day-to-day...except that this thing consistently fails at the one simple task it is designed to do: toast. Give me a break.This toaster in combination with the problems I've had with my matching blender (bought at the same time) leads me to one simple conclusion: "KitchenAid" simply does not mean what it used to. 0 stars.$LABEL$0,0,-100
wrong age group. I think this video is aimed more for 3 - 4 year olds. My youngest is a little over 2 1/2 and loves Elmo. He's showing signs for potty learning (and has used his little potty a few times) so I thought this video and a bright new RED potty would be fun this Christmas, but we didn't even get through this video. It *talks* about using the potty but doesn't really show anything... unless it's all near the end (don't know cuz we put on Curious George).I guess we'll try it again in a few days or weeks but it's pretty lame for Elmo. Nothing like how informative Elmo's World episodes are. Just a lot of talking and some silly songs. I recommend making this video like Elmo's World. It would be a lot more entertaining and helpful for younger "potty-ing" children. A lot more FUN.$LABEL$0,0,-100

What kind of Mother will I be?. I received this book from my Grandmother when I found out I was pregnant with my son. Reading through the pages was such a comfort for me; for you see, I am married to a sailor, and the birth of our son was very close to my husband going to sea and being gone 6 months. I had all the questions, concerning "can I do it alone?" and "do I really want a baby right now?" This book and a whole lot of prayer got us through. My son is now 20 years old.

This audio book is NOT unabridged. Not only is this audio book abridged, it's an ADAPTATION. It opens with dialogue between Gollum and his torturer in Mordor (did I miss a chapter?), where it sounds to me like they are torturing him with a stapler. Ian Holm and the rest of the cast give good performances but if you've read the books, even they won't be able to save this "adaptation" for you.

A mouse for a Superman. The mouse works well. A mere click turns it on, without a complex and confusing setup process. In that respect I cannot complain. You start working with it and get excited that it works so well, without any problems, that you cannot believe. But you quickly notice that it is heavy, and in less than five minutes your hand drops dead. Oh boy! It feels like you are moving a ton of bricks.

For shame... all a marketing ploy. I still have a visceral negative feeling about this manipulative piece of tripe. I'm sure I'm not the only person who went into the theater under the impression that this was real footage of a real event; shame on me for falling for the marketing of this complete sham! Not only that, within three minutes of sitting there watching it, I began to get motion sickness because of the completely unnecessary jiggling of the camera. They couldn't even hold the camera still when they were interviewing the supposed "townfolk" on the streets of Burkittsville. And then there's the language. I don't know if they thought it would be "cool" to say the "F" word in every sentence, but I just found it thoroughly disgusting; I started to hope for the characters to meet their end.

expensive. This was designed to fit the nail head but often slips and damages the floor. I ended up using my finishing nail setting tool instead and surprisingly that worked better. The finishing nail setting tool has tiny round tip with groove instead of this flat screw driver looking tip. That groove helped to prevent slipping when I apply with a hammer.

Not the greatest program. I am a native German, but don't speak a lot of it at with my kids. I was looking for something that is a fun and easy way for my son to learn German, so I liked the concept of this "fun" DVD. He was 7 at the time. This DVD was very boring to him. The dialogue leaves a bit to be desired and is not very realistic - I don't know many young kids that would be excited to receive a pair of pants as their(apparently only) birthday present from his parents as the boy in the video. It's been a while since we watched this, but I seem to remember that most of the people on the DVD did not sound like native Germans. At least one of them was clearly an American with a strong American accent, and another one (I think the grandfather) sounded like he was from Switzerland and hard to understand.

Passionate and insightful work. Rennie's work is technical and hard-going in places, but he is passionate and insightful not just on bringing out the ideas of Prof. Eliade, but also on describing the character and role of religion in the modern world. The book deserves careful and thoughtful reading and study. His defense of Eliade's early political involvements seems reasonable and fair. His defense and explanation of an inclusive definition of religion are compelling and helpful. We still have much to learn from Eliade.$LABEL$1,0,-100
We love this book!. A beautifully written book that captures my children's attention, yet doesn't underestimate their capacity to grasp new words like "weathervane" or "clutch (of eggs)." I read this to my daughter at 18 months and she wanted me to read it again and again. Within a month she was reciting it. After reading it so much I memorized it and started using the story to lull my newborn son to sleep. He is now nearly a year old, my daughter is 2-1/2 and they both still love the book.

So he raps his songs over the prison telephone and records them and yep you guessed it folks this whole album was recorded over the telephone and you get poor telephone sounding quality music for the whole album. Don't waste your money on this one folks! But don't get me wrong I think X-raided is the the only true real life original gangster rapper out there and he does deserve much respect and he does have a excellent album called Psyco Active (wich is NOT recorded on the phone either).

Fun, but small and easily scraped (And now broken). I saw all these reviews about how this isn't for kids that are young. My son is 6 and rides this thing with no problem, its actually a little small for him. His legs are all cramped up. Makes me wonder if the other people here have very small children, or possibly I'm raising a giant. The brake is getting scraped up and bent all the time since it sits close to the ground, its a pain to bend back and fix. The entire bottom of the cart is scraped up, but it doesn't seem to affect the drivability.The battery life on this thing is amazing. My son drove this almost two miles on a single charge.

Luckily the threat was averted and it was not needed, but this is not what you want to worry about when your life is on the line.I would not purchase this item. Hopefully they read this review and make it with a strong ABS plastic and stronger fastening, because they sure didn't respond to my emails.Shame really, I truly wanted to believe in this product.

Mara Rocks!. I absolutely love this book. I love Egypt and the ancient culture is especially intruiging. The story of slave girl Mara who has to play double spy captured me in the delicate web of this story line. This brave girl who falls in love with one of her masters is wonderful and excellently written. I got it just because it had Egypt on it, but I instantly and unexpectedly fell in love with the characters and the tangled web of a story Mara gets herself caught in. This is a book I believe everyoneshould read. An excellent book!$LABEL$1,0,-100
yawn.... when this type of mindless ultra-violence is repeated over and over and over again it just gets boring. Oh boy, he punched a guy in the head, I wonder if his head will explode like the other thirteen opponents... guess so. Imagine this, over and over again and you have "Fist of the North Star" in a nutshell. The plot is nothing special. The animation is not top-notch.

Think twice about buying this DVD. Nothing wrong with the film, it's the UltraViolet Digital copy you need to avoid.

ouch!. This book hurt. I usually can tolerate some silliness in pulp horror, but this book was awful. Moore makes Bentley Little look like James Joyce. A series of drawn out fight scenes makes up the plot. The main character took so many beatings and stayed alive that I thought we were heading towards an Unbreakable finale where he ends up being a superhero. Oh, and they also hit the lottery. This is not early Stephen King, this is more like early Don King.Skip this one.$LABEL$0,0,-100

My SONY Camcorder quit for no reason. I had the same thing happen with my SONY DCR-TRV19 after exactly one year. So I called the Sony support number. After holding for 45 minutes they told me my warrenty was 12 months parts, 90 days labor. They were nice enought to wave the parts seeing it is a few days past a year but they want $219 for labor!!!!!If you search the web this is a common problem with the SONY DCR-TVR19 / DCR-TRV22 / DCR-TRV33.I realy wish I'd bought a JVC. They are rated beter and less expensive.

Very good techniques, but not the flavor I expected. The book is very well written and it teaches very good techniques for cooking wich gives more flavor to the food. I have tried several of the recipes following the instructions as exactly as I could, but I am a bit dissapointed because they did not seem to me very tasty. I expected to obtain results similar or equal to the dishes you have at Italian restaurants, but there are only, perhaps,a few of them. However, the flavor is not bad either, and I love the techniques given, is just that I expected more.$LABEL$1,0,-100
List of reasons I love this book: Fun,Creative,Analytical.... This is a book which you fill in pages that have a title for each page/list. The Titles are for things you list. Example: List all of the people who love you for who you really are. Another example: List the things you would change if you could change history. Or: List the things you hide when friends come to visit.Some of the List headings are serious and some are silly, some delve into the past, others look to the future. They explore home, family, work , the world , your inner thoughts and so much more.This is a delightful book for anyone who loves to make lists, who loves psychology, or who wants to understand themselves a little better. It is a whole lot of FUN!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Very Poor, and Confusing. Even though this book gives decent information about French pronunciation, which is a very useful way to not only learn how to speak the language, but have a grasp on how to say new vocabulary as well, it starts getting confusing once it just randomly jumps into passages, expecting the reader to all of a sudden know how to comprehend the written language without grasping grammar first. Maybe it would have been useful with the aid of an audio CD, but unfortunately it doesnt have it. And another problem with this book is the way it randomly presents new vocab when it has nothing to do with the context of the passages. Possibly a beginner can get through this book, but it would unfortunately be a long and tedious chore that will eventually bore one out of their mind! There are so many great french learning books out there, and this is NOT one of them!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Main theme : Economics?. My wife and I first saw the series online, the title images we had seen (not this one) made this look a bit... risque to say the least.We were pleasantly surprised to find no real focus on nudity beyond 'doll-esque' levels.Really the main focus is the economies of medieval times, how travelling merchants made money etc. Its fascinating in a weird way; interspersed with supernatural mythos like harvest gods and the like. Its very interesting. Hopefully a third season is on the way somewhere...As for this particular box set, the bluray titlescreen seemed a bit off, but the video itself was great. Nothing to complain about really and it played perfectly on the PS3 as well.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Manfrotto Monopod. Product was shipped promptly and the quality, as well as the usability is super. It is lightweight, study and easy to use.

Cobraaaa!. As a G.I. Joe fan and collector since 1986 I even enjoy watching the original series today. As a native German I liked both Joe and Cobras alike. Both factions owned a number of great characters! Some good guys some bad guys but all of them were unique!Though I generally like Manga-Style movies and especilly the female characters look cuter than ever, I don't consider G.I. Joe Sigma 6 a worthy heir to the classic series. Sure, it contains action from the start to the end, but the character of the figures was all but neglected...Afterall I don't think Sigma 6 has much in common with the originals since only the names and the history... so it could well be name in a completly different way and is just an other Anime among others!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Shocking and Disturbing. Until this book I was a fan of romace novels and Connie Mason in particular. The blatant abuse and racism in this book was shocking!

Himmler is a subject worthy of a biography for his infamous career but Padfield's work is so full of inaccuracies on so many levels I tossed the book in the trash after the first few chapters it was so bad.A better but not nearly as lengthy biography can be found in Heinz Hoehne's "The Order of the Deaths Head."

GREAT SOUND. Johnny Smith was first known for his gorgeous guitar sound when he made one of his first albums called "Moonlight in Vermont" which I heard on mono Lp 50 years ago. His gorgeous technique was the envy of all jazz guitarists. We studied his books, but couldn't make head or tail of them.There are 20 tunes on this CD, & you'll probably recognize most of them. He is a jazz guitarist, but one who is very easy to listen to....I loved his ballad style as well as the tunes he does at breakneck speed.I particularly liked his rendition of the Duke Ellington compositions, namely "I got it bad;" "Prelude to a kiss;" & Monk's "Round Midnight."Get this album, & you won't regret it. If you're new to jazz, this is a great place to start.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Ambient Dub at its Finest. Damn this is a good CD! This is one of the first and best of the "ambient dub" sub-genre of electronic music -- a beautiful, bass-heavy, laid-back set of electronic soundscapes that sound great when you're chilling at home or too stoned to move.Ambient dub is an offshoot of electronic music that never really dominated the charts anywhere as far as I can tell, but it's a tasty, organic-sounding, and highly agreeable approach to digital music nonetheless.

Very poor quality pumpkin seeds. Prior to purchasing this brand of seeds, I had always used the NOW Foods brand (which has generally been a very consistently good quality seed from my own exprience). This being my first try at using a different brand turned out to be a very big mistake. I usually purchase seeds in bulk, so I purchased 4 bags of these seeds. To my surprise, every one of the bags contained small, brown or discolored seeds, all of which are not the healthful green full flavored seeds that I was used to with the NOW Foods brand. Hey, I'm not a spokesperson for one brand or another which is why I wanted to try a different brand to compare. However, in this case, I blame myself for thinking the proverbial grass was greener on the other side....I couldn't have been more wrong in this case!....

Even Better Than Hybrid Theory. Yes, it is no lie. Meteora is even better than Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was simply incredible. I'm so happy that Linkin Park didn't sell out and make all of their songs sound like "In the End" since they had such a success with that song. Instead, Meteora is much heavier than their first effort, Hybrid Theory. The music is better, the lyrics are more mature, and the vocals by both Chester Benington and Mike Shinoda have improved greatly. I definently recommend this album.

His Best Salsa Album. Great songs, great voice. I don't think I'll will ever hear Marc make a full salsa album, without any of the pop or ballads. The style of music that in his albums are ideally not danceable, basically because the louder and more aggressive arrangements will take away from his voice. That is one major difference between him and other salseros like Victor Manuelle, Tito Rojas, etc.; they don't necessarily have the same range as Marc, but the orchestra doesn't become as a distant background. His records are to be listened to relax.$LABEL$1,0,-100

He and the late Shirley Povich were the best sports columnists The Washington Post ever had (present sports columnists included). The stories in Kindred's book are a joy to read. He's got a Ring Lardner touch. At his best, no one is funnier than Kindred. A few of his tales feel like a Frank Capra movie, sentimental and heart-warming. Baseball captures the essence of America with love of family, country and seventh inning rallies. Kindred makes it come all come alive.

The bottle seems to last forever even though I use it all of the time. I just bought a second bottle even though I am only about half way through the first because I dont want to run out. Rub a little on with the aplicator tip, let it set for a few momments, wipe clean with a lint free rag. Dont play dirty. BUY and USE this prodoct.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Excellent Product. Excellent product within affordable price. I had used before various types of rice cooker such as Sanyo, Krups and Moulinex but I have find Zojirushi is the best because of light weight and super non-stick cooking pot. I am using it almost three times a day but found no dusturbance while I am new user but in my experience and Asian ethnicity I think it is one of the best product available in the USA market.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A major let down. This game is a serious let down for all Rainbow Six fans, it's main highlights include poor storylines and plots, edgy cinematics and re-inforced by terrible graphics.

A great book about maya art and culture. This book is well worth the price and a must for anyone interested in maya art and culture. Aside from the full color photographs of maya figurines from museums in both Mexico and the US, I also like the layout of the text which is divided into 10 chapters categorizing the figurines pictured and describing each one with extra explanations when needed. Definetely one of of the best books on the subject, highly recommendable.$LABEL$1,0,-100
It was so bad, it's sad that it will be taking up space in landfill. Got it and immediately checked it out using the regular plug. No problems in the 5 minute trial. Got in the car and it did not work with the plug for the lighter. We bought a new plug. It took 4-5 tries loading a disk before it would stop telling us that there was "no disk". This included two brand new, out of the box DVD's. The "ok" button didn't work on the unit so we had to use the remote. The cables weren't really tight, so sometimes they would unplug. Not a huge deal, but the unit had to be turned on again every time and our kids aren't old enough to do this themselves.At this point, we were almost ready to try to trade it. An hour later my son kept saying his screen was turning off. Then, it turned off completely and it never went back on.Not a good deal for all the aggravation. If you've got kids, you have better ways to spend your time.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Illegal Drugs Save The Earth!.... One of the better SCREAM offshoots, THE FACULTY succeeds at being an excellent 90s high school version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS w/ enough paranoia, terror, and humour to keep things interesting. The cast is unbelievable, including Clea Duvall (HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER, THE KILLING ROOM), Josh Hartnett (HALLOWEEN H2O, 30 DAYS OF NIGHT), Framke Janssen (LORD OF ILLUSION), Elijah Wood (THE ICE STORM, LOTR, SIN CITY), Robert Patrick (TERMINATOR 2, EYE SEE YOU), Piper Laurie (RUBY, CARRIE), and Salma Hayek (FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) as the school nurse! This movie proves what we've always suspected, that our teachers are human hosts for alien parasites! This explains a lot! We also learn that illegal drugs are the salvation of mankind. The alien invaders just can't handle them! Whew! THE FACULTY is fun-tastic! Cheers...$LABEL$1,0,-100
Call it what it is - their big breakthrough.. If "selling out" and "abandoning the grassroots" is how highly talented, immensely listenable bands like Vertical Horzion hit the big time, well, I just wish it'd happen more often. This is, quite simply, beautiful music. There's been so much baggage hung on the whole alternative music, it's refreshing to see a return to the basics of harmonious composition and great singing. There isn't a bad moment anywhere, not one bit of sappiness, annoyance, boredom, insufferability, or any other of the failings that have doomed countless promising albums. In a nutshell, if you love music, this album quite literally has everything you want.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not a fan of Oates. I have tried to read the work of this amazing writer and more often than not find myself closing the book completely uninterested in the characters and/or the story. Technically, I can appreciate and even admit to the awe she inspires. But for some reason her writing leaves me cold.This was only the second of her books which I managed to finish and I genuinely enjoyed this novel very much. The narrator is flawed and vulnerable, tough and offensive, and I wanted to know what would happen to her and to her gang.I like this book. I will continue to try to read Oates whenever the impulse presents itself. But I will also forgive myself if I am unwilling to finish what I start.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The Last Hurah. These episodes are original, thought provoking, and well told. They both would have made exelent live-action shows, though Koo-Koo-Khan would have been quite expensive to produce. It is truly a shame that NBC decided to cancel the series after these two episodes aired. Since it was shown early on Saturday mornings, young children were the prominant viewer, and they just didn't "get" the show. If they had simply moved the show to prime-time, it may have thrived and lasted for five more seasons. Of course, if that had happened, Star Trek history would have been changed forever.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A fun introduction for kids. This set rocks! The child (over 6 years old), with parent's guidance, can immediately follow a starter project to do a simple hookup and get immediate results (lighting, sound, etc).

The AM radio is the absolute favorite. The tuner, however, can't really get few stations.But it's a great introduction to basic electronic components nonetheless. They learned the wiring, flow of current, switches, resisters, capacitors, speakers, etc.$LABEL$1,0,-100
I thought this book was O.K. but nothing special.... To be honest this book really didn't do much for me. It was a bit boring. Nothing was really going on in the book & the couple didn't even start a relationship until the last 10 pages of the book & then all of a sudden they were wed. Rachel came to Springwater to be the first teacher & upon her arrival she meets Trey & soon finds out that he is part-owner of the Saloon across the street from her school. She despises the Saloon but they soon find that they care for one another. Not much more then that. The book was just lacking something. It needed some adventure or something. I sure hope the rest of this series gets better. This is book #2 in the Springwater series.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Amazing. This is not your typical John Grisham book. When I started reading it, I didn't know anything about it. By the end, I was crying because it so moved me. I truly enjoyed this book. It's written from the perspective of a young boy who doesn't completely understand everything that's going on around him. I really enjoyed that aspect of the story because it's so different from so many other books out there, expecially other John Grisham books. If you just read Grisham for the lawyers and courtroom antics, you won't want to read this book, but if you want to read an excellent book, I truly recommend this one.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Awful. This is just an awful edition, full of errors. There are clef signs missing, misplaced accidentals galore. Some of the errors I can correct, because there are two choices and one doesn't sound right. But this is extremely complex music -- all of Iberia is -- and in some cases, it's difficult to know what Albeniz actually wrote. I bought this because I was frustrated by the difficulty these days of obtaining piano scores (Patelson's in New York and Yesterday Service in Cambridge, MA, two of my favorites, are now closed). A mistake. Now I will try a little harder and get myself a real edition. It makes no sense to devote the time and effort to learning music as difficult as this from a (very) substandard edition.$LABEL$0,0,-100

why do they all have to go "commercial". Unfortunately with this album Beenie Man shows us that his work is evolving in the wrong direction.

An Important First Step. This is an important study of the responses of Assyrian immigrants and their children to their newfound land of freedom and its lure for assimilation. The vibrant Assyrian community of Chicago has maintained its strong cultural identity, as the author asserts through a superb pictorial essay, by slowly shedding the social distinctions brought from homeland.While the author ignores the tumulus years following the great exodus of 1980's due to the Iran-Iraq War & the Islamic Revolution in Iran, his study of the cultural activities between 1930's and 1960's would be interesting to most readers - particularly those with ties to Chicago.Since the politics of the "Chicagoland" continue to affect Assyrian-American politics in general, Mr. Shoumanov's book is an important first step in the contextualization of the Assyrian experience in America.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Doesn't quite cut it. "Coyote" was an impulse buy, and the "steal a starship" set-up was so contrived and preposterous that I almost gave up on the book - Amazon reviewers suggested I hold on for the Coyote part, which WAS a lot better, and I finally enjoyed the book enough to try this sequel.Although these stories are well crafted and generally connected to the rebellion plot in a "life on the hard frontier" context, they often felt more like writing exercises to me, especially the one about a bio-engineered bat/man vampire dude who arrives on Coyote leading his religious cult (as if someone said "I challenge you to write a Coyote story involving a vampire" - this is hard SF?!?). This book seems more like a Wild West story set on another planet, with rugged freedom-loving rebels fighting the oppressive, power-hungry socialist overlords. But there are weird animals and plants, and some strangely selective advanced technology thrown in for good measure. And a vampire. Oy.$LABEL$0,0,-100
NOTHING LIKE THIS BOOK OUT THERE. A brilliant collection of prose and poetry on the mystery of art and art-making, this book is not only moving but also powerful and engaging. The selections are beautifully varied from what were originally reviews in art magazines to poetic musings by acclaimed poets, diary-like entrees and studio interviews with artists wrestling with pictorial problems. Sitting down with this book is like an aesthetic journey, and rising up again one feels strangely refreshed and revitalized. It is a wonderful book and a treasure trove of insights and revelations on art and creative living. William J. Havlicelk PhD$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great printer. Great buy.. Did a lot of research before I bought this printer. Even called Canon for a definition of some of the features I didn't understand and received quick, friendly help.

Hypnotic. I began reading with WWI and continued to the end, and now I look forward to starting again with the Greeks. The most astonishing conjunction is the torture of Eric Lomax and his mates, followed immediately by Bill Laurence's account of the Nagasaki bombing.

Ditto. Sadly, I must support the opinions of the reviewer who preceded me here. If you want to get into this material, you need to go with the recordings by the original ensemble prior to their break-up in the mid-30s.

Just a pretty face. I bought this stroller because I couldn't afford a Bugaboo and because it looks really cool. The fabrics are really hip and the overall look is stylish. But it was not worth it! I have been disappointed by this stroller again and again. It is bulky, not travel-friendly. I was excited about the flipping handle, but it doesn't push well at all in that position because the wheels rub against the basket. It's really cumbersome to lift over curbs and is rather difficult to maneuver in general.Even with those drawbacks I figured I would keep it and just get a cheap umbrella stroller for travel, but today i was out with it and a bolt fell out of the frame, making it impossible to push up over curbs!

Period piece from a bad period. This film was silly and dumb the day it came out, and it remains so today, even given the nostalgic smirk that it will conjure up from most of its viewers. The eighties was a time of teen dance movies, and this one cashes in as best it can. A reviewer below is right to point out that the premise of a town that outlaws dancing is utterly ridiculous. (Perhaps had the film been set in the late 1600s it would have been believable, but then they wouldn't have been able to sell the cheesy pop soundtrack.) Along comes the inevitable good-looking rebel to shake things up with his slinky moves. As a period piece, this formulaic eighties film might be good for a few warm guffaws. Otherwise it's pretty insipid, and holds up even less well than many Elvis movies from the sixties.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Big Disappointment. I have been a HUGE fan of Godsmack since the very beginning. They are a truly talented band, and one of my top 5 favorite bands. However, I sure am glad that I only paid the special Amazon price of $8.96, instead of a normal CD price. 'IV' is a classic example of a popular band that has a magical musical formula for success, and that formula has worked for them on all of their past CD's, and then they decide, "Hey, let's experiment and try something different since we are famous and everyone will buy it, even if they don't care for it, we'll still make millions." Of course, Sully's voice is awesome as always, and the musicianship is top notch. 'Speak' is classic killer Godsmack, and 'Temptation' runs a close second. However, they need 9 new tracks to complete the CD. I'll save 'Speak' and 'Temptation' to my computer and MP3 player, but the CD will get buried in some cabinet, and I will anxiously await their next release, which hopefully will revert back to the magic formula!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Profiling and Finding a Wife. The author in this second book of the Millionaire series offers up some new interesting insights about wealthy people and thier ways. Unfortunately he maintains his bias against working folks read "economic dropouts" and this time there is a lamentable self-congratulatory tone. I would like to see a book that looks at wealthy people from every segment of society and every economic background. This book is written for middle to upper middle class white college educated people who perhaps have money problems. I strongly suspect the author has little use for any other kind of people hence the pejorative "economic dropout". If the potential reader fits the above described profile and wants to get married then this book might be a good read. This time I was smart and checked it out from the library.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great First Safety Razor. Compared to my old Mach 3, this is easily a five star product.Cons:- However, compared to other safety razors, it lacks an adjustable angle. This wasn't a problem for me just starting out, but I'm now considering branching out into more adaptable razors.Pros:- It delivers on the longer handle, though it turns out I grip it pretty close to the blade anyway.- I've had mine for 2 years without the breaks described in other reviews. *fingers crossed*All in all, it's been a transformative shaving experience. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to switch to safety razors that has large hands.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Cliche's Made Palatable for Middle America. I have an idea. Let's take as many gay cliche's as we can possibly put together in 3 amazingly short segments. Oh wait, we don't have to, it's all here in "Common Ground". In the 3rd, 30 minute sement alone we have veterens protesting a gay wedding ceremony, the military dad who doesn't approve, one of the groom-to-be about to run away cause he's unsure, two lesbian caterers, the straight supportive female friend, the gay florist, a third lesbian who is getting sperm from the other groom-to-be to inseminate her on his wedding day and a priest who is rethinking the church's stance on homosexuality. I haven't met all of these citizens of the gay world in my 26 years as an out gay male much less in 30 minutes.I'm all for gay representation in any form, but this is not a flick for the gay community. It is clearly intended for middle american to gain an (unrealistic) glimpse into "those crazy gays and their antics".$LABEL$0,0,-100
The Epic Poem of the English Language. John Milton's "Paradise Lost" is one of the all-time classics of English literature. The epic poem begins with Satan just having been expelled from Heaven. Adam and Eve are tempted in the Garden of Eden, and fall. Before the two are expelled from Eden, Adam has revealed to him some of the major events of the Old and New Testaments, culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. The epic has enthralled readers for well over three centuries.One thing that must be borne in mind when reading this work is that Milton's theology was not orthodox Christian theology, but Arianism, as he denied the Trinity and believed that Christ was not eternal, but created by God the Father. Also, the seventeenth century English is difficult to plow through. However, by forcing the reader to reflect on the origin of evil and to consider what they believe about the concept of original sin, "Paradise Lost" proves to be worth the effort one must make in reading it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Title is the only thing interesting about this book. Regionalism across the North South Divide is not for the novice reader. This book is a compilation of case studies from several authors and is very difficult to read. This book is nothing but fact after fact on several different countries. The writers present an entire idea in one sentence and move to the next idea, without allowing the reader to digest the information already presented. It is a shame this book is so poor because I am interested in the subject but don't feel I gained anything from this book. I would have given it one star but made it two because it does contain a lot of facts in relation to globalization in lesser-developed countries. The editors condensed way too much information into this book and lost the free-flow of thoughts and ease of comprehension. I would not recommend this book to anyone.$LABEL$0,0,-100

sorry to disagree. I'm sorry to disagree with all the positive reviews, but even though I usually like wild juxtapositions like this, I don't find this pairing at all successful. The whole CD reeks of the editing room, with the music of Bach being performed throughout in a stiff, stilted manner in order to synchronize with the African rhythms. All I could think about was the singers with headphones on in a recording studio trying to cram Bach's fluid phrases into the rhythmic straitjacket of the drum tracks. The 3-part invention is played on (or rather programmed into) an electronic keyboard with an ugly fake organ sound - why not have a real organist play it on a real organ? And the clapping overlaid on Bach's sublime "Ruht wohl" is just lame! I can't speak to the authenticity of the African element of this CD, but as a classical musician I can tell you that the classical element is severely compromised - even rendered lifeless - by the pairing.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great Double Duty Product. My nail technician trains others in OPI products and uses them exclusively on my nails. I normally get a french manicure (gel) on my nails with OPI products once every 4 or 5 weeks. Just recently I started painting my own nails in between my manicures and have been getting amazing results with the Start-to-Finish.Using it as a base coat assures that the color doesn't bleed into the edges of my manicure (for when I want to go back to just the white tips) and also helps the color adhere well. My technician did tell me that this base coat does adhere better to gel nails than bare ones, if that helps. She also highly recommended that I do just three swipes (center, and each edge) with each coat. Over-painting with each coat can cause some of the problems people have with chipping.Once I have my nails painted, top coated, and completely dry, I can get at least a week without chipping. I even went on a camping/backpacking adventure and did not end up with a single chip.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Beginning, middle and end - the entire novel was just unbelievable. I will be recommending this to everyone!! Definitely a permenant bookshelf book! For those unsure of the idea of reading a time traveling book - do not hesitate on this one!

Good for people who don't have internet access. This is a good strategy book for someone with no internet access. Oh wait, Dark Age of Camelot can only be played by people that have net access! D'oh!There are numerous web sites with more accurate, up-to-date information. Particularly in a game such as this which is being patched and changed constantly, a paper guide has limited value.

Effective of Methioform for managing UTI in cats. My cat since when she was very young has had a recurring tendency to develop Urinary Tract Infection. On our Vet's recommendation, I put her on half a tab of methioform daily to change the PH of her urine. This has been very effective in keeping the UTI at bay. Methioform also has the advantage of being very palatable for cats; my cat, who is very bad with medication usually just happily munches it up with her dry biscuits. I would recommend this as a good way of preventing a nasty and troublesome problem. I am writing from outside of the US; I had trouble purchasing methioform from a few websites, particularly Animal Meds sites because they require prescriptions.

This guy makes Deion Sanders look like a chump!. This is truly a player for all ages, and why football "back then" is soooo much better than football today. He did it all. Play the run, play the pass, hit . .you name it. Jack Tatum let his actions on the field speak for itself. And he didnt get caught up in "marketing himself" on the field after a good play either (ala "Deion"). Knowing how brutal the old Raiders clubs were in the 60's & 70's, and to a man, having all of them agree that Jack Tatum was the toughest of all of them (Ken Stabler in "Snake" and John Madden's books for just a couple of examples), this tells you just how good of a football player this guy was. The fact that he loved and respected Woody Hayes at Ohio State for just being always "honest and upfront with him," when all other college recruiters were trying to buy him out of high school, showed me just what kind of character this guy was made of. A good read.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The characters come together in an incredible situation, all at odds, but by the dramatic ending, they are dancing together in a fine and beautiful waltz. But the ball must end, and when it does, I was left stunned. It is not overly graphic in its sexuality or violence, and yet it manages to evoke strong emotions from the reader.

Great for a basic intro or advanced practicioners. If you don't know who Kelly Worden is then it's about time you find out. I just attended his 2009 Water & Steel seminar near Tacoma, Washington.

Training in his garage converted dojo, he shows you how to completely dismantle your opponent. He employs a no-nonsense, down and dirty, in your face approach.

It also came with a cord to plug into the headphone jack of other mp3 players that aren't compatible with the iPod dock.The sound is great and the volume is loud enough.The only problem is that when the music is not playing and the device is left on, we can hear a little "hum" that is annoying enough to catch our attention and go over and unplug the speakers from the power source.Other than that, it's been a great product.$LABEL$1,0,-100

No complaints about the content…. I've got no quarrel with the content. But the format of this single volume edition is difficult to use. The pages are onion-skin so there is some bleed through of the opposite page. Worse, the book doesn't lay flat and the contents curve towards the spine where it is very difficult to read. This is a case where a larger page width would have helped by allowing a more generous inner margin.If you struggle with this and twist and bend the book, you'll find excellent introductions and explanatory material. I'd like to see these plays released in individual titles with a better margin and thicker paper.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Algebra 2 Work Sheet Companion. Has to be purchased and used with Mathtutor Alg. 2 dvd which is very good. The Algebra 2 Worksheet Companion is perfect for summer preview or review. The number of problems per section does not exceed 14-15 so don't be daunted. And the problems are easy, focusing on basic principles not gotcha questions.I've used Mathtutor dvd's on my son for Algebra, Precalc & Trig, Chemistry and Physics. They calm him down and reassure him that his class is doable. Maybe your son or daughter doesn't have a five star lecturer for a teacher like Jason Gibson, in that case these dvd's are really golden.My son scored well using the Mathtutor dvd's and, by doing every single problem he could get his hands on from whatever source.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Pretty much all you could ask. This is really an excellent book for a woodworker seeking guidance with the particular challenges of chairbuilding.Most chapters cover some particular chair of the author's creation. Don't worry about whether Miller's designs will appeal or not. Plans are included, but copying them really isn't the point. They're presented here as case studies in conceptualization and construction, with lessons that are widely applicable. For example, how to accurately lay out and cut angled tenons, how to obtain a flat surface on an otherwise curved leg, how to fashion a slip seat, etc. And throughout, Miller details a bunch of clever jigs and methods of work.A caution: familiarity with the ABCs of furnituremaking and access to some modicum of shop stuff is assumed here. This isn't a beginning woodworking text, which only makes sense, given the subject.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great way to increase your fruits and vegetables. I have been using this product for about three weeks now in my smoothies. I don't use it often enough to have noticed any substantial change in my health as other people have stated, but it is definitely a quick and easy way to increase my daily intake of "fruits and vegetables." I put it in all of my smoothies, from banana to berry and everything in between, and can't even taste it. It does affect the color of the smoothie, as it is green, but as long as that doesn't bother you (and I don't know why it would) it's a great nutritional addition.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Weakest battery I have ever seen. Not a bad razor as far as the shaving goes, but the battery is just awful.

hatred, not history. How, in these PC days, did this book ever get published? The constant bashing of Christians isn't just offensive, it's factually incorrect in so many ways. The author belittles the great of accomplishes of many who were motivated by faith, and in general is utterly scornful of her subjects.It's one thing to present the negative truths of history, slavery really did happen, but quite another to present it in its most brutal and ugly forms IN A CHILDREN'S BOOK.The writer clearly has personal problems dealing with those of the Christian faith, be they living or dead, and treats her reads with a patronizing scorn as well as her subjects. I'm glad I read this before my son saw it - I try to teach him to look at BOTH sides of a story, something the author fails to do in her rush to condemn the great explorers of history. I call them great not for their treatment of human beings, but for the way they pushed human knowledge far beyond its previous boundaries.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A Wonderful Book -- highly recommend!!!. I think this is a wonderful book. While it might be a cliche, I "felt like I was there" much of the time while I was reading. It is obvious that a lot of research went into this book, and the book is written in a very engaging style. The author is a fantastic story teller, and that is definitely part of the book's charm. I felt like I actually got to know the men in theregiment as I read about what happened to them during the four year struggle. To make a long story short, I love reading about the Civil War and I loved reading this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The most AMAZING soap for sensitive skin. Length:: 3:04 MinsThis is my video review about Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap, which I absolutely love!-It is great for my sensitive skin(I bought a whole SLEW of products from Sephora especially for sensitive skin (DermaDoctor, I think and others), but none of them worked for me.)-I can use this on my face and my body with glowing results-I always have to wear make up, but when I started using this, I went without make up for a while bc my skin looked so good!-It is tingly and it feels SO refreshing-You can take a "quick" shower with this by putting water in a bowl, adding a little Dr. B's soap, dipping in a washcloth and wiping yourself off - save water, save time :-) - then wipe the soap off with the wash cloth and some water ;]- I believe they support efforts to INFORM consumers and encourage honest labeling on food, based on my research -- another reason to buy and support Dr. Bronner's!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Keep coming back to this Tosca. This was the first Tosca I every bought (about 15 years ago), probably because I could afford any of the other lavishly-packaged recordings. Since then, I have collected many of the others, including the Caballe set, which is wonderful, Freni's two recordings, Gheorghiu, Vaness, Price and even a rare recording by Anna Moffo. However, I keep coming back to this Nelly Miricioiu Tosca on Naxos. Miricioiu gives us a solid performance with her glorious vocal tone, and the rest of the cast is of a really good standard. It's such a pity that Miricioiu didn't record more in her career. Don't let the fact that it's a Naxos recording put you off buying this set. They have produced some of the most outstanding operas (Tancredi, Zauberflote, Sonnambula are all worth it).$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good Read. I like King, and this is one of his better ones. Not quite as good as The Stand or Hearts in Atlantis, but close. When it boils right down to it, it's a love story, and one that has a smidge of Nicholas Sparks. There was only one part I had some trouble with and that was believing the whole world of Boo ya Moon, an imaginary world that author Scott Landon often visits. If you can buy into this supernatural world, the story is perfect. Once I forced myself to care about it, I enjoyed it. Even if you don't, the story of Scott and Lisey's marriage makes it all worth it. By the time you finish with the book, you'll feel as if you know these two people, and you'll care very much about them.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Horrible Quality, Misleading Picture on Box. This toy was a huge disapointment. My father bought it for my daughter, who loves Strawberry Shortcake. We took it out of the box and set it up, but it kept falling apart. It comes in tons of tiny little pieces that you have to snap together, but the pieces fall apart at the slightest amount of pressure. My daughter ended up screaming with frustration. And it didn't come with all of the furniture shown on the box. Only the fireplace, armoire, and piano.

Perhaps my only objection is you must grab the base of the opening through the fabric with one hand while tightening the lid with the other.

This was a perfect, and attractive replacement for a 20 year old range hood. My local Home Depot didn't even carry 36" wide, much less offer a range of options. You will need to buy and wire in a plug, and provide some duct tape to seal to your existing duct, but this thing was a slam dunk.

Awesome debut.. Even though "Bloodletting" is often considered to be their best album, sometimes I think this is my favorite. Some of it's almost punk, but the rest is the melodic alt-rock that they're known for. "True" is an excellent song, and great opener, and "Beware Of Darkness" and "Still In Hollywood" are sweet also. But my two favorites by far are "Make Me Cry" and "Song For Kim (she said)". Both are really moving, to me anyway.

This Nothing Is Everything. The Hole in the Universe is everything promised by those raves from Oliver Sacks and Brian Greene and Dava Sobel -- and much more! It is a deep look at an elusive, yet centrally important subject, presented with eloquence, originality and charm. It amazes me that Cole has been able to take us to the frontiers of physics, exploring questions that physicists sstill puzzle over, and yet still make it entirely accessible (and, yes, even fun) to a complete novice like myself. I have read about ideas like string theory and the strange "repulsive force" that seems to be expanding the universe, but never before were these ideas so clear and appealing to me. Her writing is so fresh and lovely, it takes your breath away. And I love the connections between the notion of "nothing" in perception -- the holes in our heads, as Cole calls them -- and the nothings of mathematics and physics. Buy this book and give it to all your friends. They will thank you.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Jeepers, this movie is the pits. Every once in a while a movie comes along that, despite the fact that it has kept me at the edge of my seat throughout, is totally ruined by the ending. I'm sorry, but I hate endings where the villain wins. This movie was terrifying . . . sure. But the thrill, at least to me, is to see how the heroes will finally overcome the villain. And that doesn't happen in this movie. If it had a better ending, it might have gotten four stars. One is as far as I'd go now, and this is only because I can't give it zero.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Disappointing. This "book" with large type and few pages can be read in one sitting and does not live up to its billing as a look behind the scenes of an NBA season. All this book actually amounts to is a short synopsis of an NBA season with little interaction between the players the author is supposed to be introducing us to and himself. At points it comes across as ego stroking on Palmer's part dropping names of all the people who know him and how he gets into all the parties at All-Star weekend. The premise of this book has potential, unfortunately Palmer does not deliver what it is billed as.$LABEL$0,0,-100
find a better trimmer.... Ergonomically, the trimmer is OK. It's kinda heavy, but that's to be expected with a 4-cycle engine. The severe vibration limits my trimming sessions to only 5-10 min tops. The biggest problem, however, has only revealed itself after a season (maybe 10 hours) of use: the engine is smoking and stalling out after a few minutes running. After ensuring it had oil and fresh gas (4-cycle, so no gas/oil mix) and the problem still occurred, I went online to find a service center. None within 50 miles of my zip code. The company (called MTD, but still uses the Troy-Bilt name) was no help at all. I've looked into other repair facilities, but I can't identify who actually manufactures the engine, so nobody will take it apart. I'm either left to fiddle with it myself, or to get another trimmer.$LABEL$0,0,-100
not a good 3D experience. I bought this dvd thinking it would be great to watch because Miley Cyrus is a great singer and performer, but when I opened it to watch the 3D version there was nothing 3D about it. It came with four red and blue 3D glasses . It made me feel nauseated (well, not really) but I could not watch anymore of the 3D version. You can even watch it without the glasses because it looks like the 2D version except with a little blur. It is horrible like watching VHS version. It was a disappointment. I might return it if i can. I wonder if other 3D glasses will work. For me, I don't like concert versions of songs.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not practical or academic enough. The finance market is flooded with paper, but much is redundant and some isn't even very useful. This book manages to be both.

Obscure film deserves much wider recognition.. "When Time Expires" is a masterful sci-fi/fantasy which is not only well-acted but also has an interesting story line.

Coulda been even better as a two-disc set. As a single-disc collection goes, this one can't get much better. One can argue that the failed "Congo" should've been left off (and possibly even "In Your Wardrobe") in favor of still more heavily-played tracks from the Phil Collins era, but as it stands this is an adequate career retrospective. I personally would love to see a second compilation, which would have to include: "Illegal Alien", "Home By The Sea", "Taking It All Too Hard", "No Reply At All", "Man On The Corner", "Paperlate", "Just A Job To Do", "Duchess", "Keep It Dark", "Never A Time" and "Driving The Last Spike".$LABEL$1,0,-100

Choose another reel. I have two Mitchell 300x & one 300xe reels and love them. Great reels with 100% solid preformance. On the other hand I bought a 310ex expecting the same. Well, I spend more time waisting line 4lbs Mono, Floro, & Fireline. The line type I used did not make a differance on this reels proformance. I would get birds nest constantly. It will simply drive you nuts and take the pleasure out of your day on the water. I found it did not matter if I closed the bail with my hand or by turning the handle. (very stiff bail by the way) This is the worst Mitchell I ever owned. I purchased it for my new Ultra Lite last summer. I will never use this reel again. I exchanged it for a Shimano Sedona 1000.

Uninspired attempt to match bandmates' solo fame. This was one more unsuccessful attempt by Tony Banks to match the solo success that Genesis bandmates Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford were achieving. This time around, Banks added a couple of singers and tried to call it a band. One of the singers is Jayney Klimek, formerly of the Other Ones (not the Grateful Dead Other Ones, the OTHER Other Ones, the ones who did "We Are What We Are" and "Holiday").

Hair on fire. I managed to get through 45% of this book before I realized I would rather set my hair on fire (if I had any) than go back and read any more.So far, at 45%, there was no story. There were characters by the dozens, each with a contrived space type name like:Yelena Bugolubovo,Nierbog,Veblen, etc etc.Some of them were described with square heads, and some were huge, from other planets all settling on this space city.I was so frustrated by ill-defined characters, and the number of them without giving me a picture for my mind to grasp, that I had had enough/Maybe there's a story line, you know; good guys vs bad guys somewhere later on, but a book, a play, a movie, should entertain.This book missed the mark for me.You can obtain it at no cost, but that's about what it's worth in my humble opinion.Sorry to be so strong about it, but honesty is better than false diplomacy.Fred Auerbach$LABEL$0,0,-100

Constantly in my CD player. Great songs, wonderful pop song production, beautiful harmonies. I just bought this CD, and at 52 years old, I'm embarassed to say that I didn't know just how good The Hollies were. Certainly very near the equal of the Beatles, before they got all "important". This collection has all the classic "first Hollies" songs, before G. Nash left and they went all MOR in the very late sixties/early seventies - which is exactly what I wanted. That means no "Long Cool Woman" or "He Ain't Heavy". If you favor those songs, you need another collection. My one regret is that "King Midas in Reverse" is not on this CD.

Good but a bit harsh. The book has excellent info on baby's sleep needs and cycles.

Not their best work. I'm a huge Blood Brothers fan. HOWEVER-- Crimes is a terribly commercialistic release lacking creativity and the Blood Brothers usual spark. I'll admit Burn Piano Island, Burn was also a rather commercialistic, mainstream (as mainstream as someone like the Blood Brothers can get) release, however, It did have at least 3 songs I liked a lot-- Though it also contained the WORST song to ever be produced: Denver Max. Aside from these two releases the Blood Brothers have always been an amazing trio-- with excellent works such as This Adultry is Ripe and my personal favorite release of theirs-- March On Electric Children.

I called their "customer service" line in the hopes that I had not set the margins properly but was told that although they receive complaints EVERY day about this problem, it's not a design problem, it's my problem.

Great! If you already know the material.... According to an instructor of mine (not the one teaching the course), this book was written by mathematicians for mathematicians. If you are not already well-versed in proofs and logic, this book is excruciatingly difficult to follow. The instructor teaching the course was a Ph.D. from MIT. Obviously he understands it, but both he and the book utterly failed to explain the concepts in terms that a normal computer engineer/scientist undergraduate could understand. If this is required reading for you Discrete Structures (or equivalent course) I highly recommend getting a second book that explains the terms in plain English (as opposed to in the language of Math, which I am not fluent in).

I also find it very uncomfortable, even after I cut off back ends (as suggested by the instructions to provide a proper fit). Unless you are 8 or 9 feet tall and have a gigantic mouth, I highly doubt it will fit without cutting off the back ends. So you're stuck cutting off the back ends to try and get a proper fit, but of course even if you're not satisfied after that, you can't really return it in that state. Also the case it comes with doesn't stay shut.$LABEL$0,0,-100
It's been worth the wait!. It is about time that NSYNC got their CD out. But trust me, it is well worth the wait! This CD is packed with excellent songs. I also like the way that NSYNC is trying songs and styles of singing that other boy bands haven't yet. They are definatly talented. If you had any doubts about this then go out and buy the CD. It is definatly worth the money, and I promise you that you will be happy with this CD! Happy listening!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Cannot recommend this at all. WARNING: I received this thru the USPS today. It is much smaller than stated on site. It is very light, crystal is typically heavier than glass and this is glass. Also every edge is razor blade sharp and is way too dangerous to have around small children. More of a weapon than an ornament. I contacted seller immediately and have heard nothing from them. Very disappointed. I feel like they should have paid me to take it off their hands. You will regret it if you buy it.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A great True crime book. I really enjoyed reading this book it was very interesting and thought that the authors did an amazing job interviewing the key people. It did get a little slow at times but it was just because of all the details. It did have a little too much detail as to what was done to the children and the effects that occurred but it helps us understand and realize what the parents and medical staff had to see these helpless children go through. I do recommend this book to all who like to read true crime. Enjoy! :o)$LABEL$1,0,-100
good while it lasts, but doesn't last long. As others have reported, quality is disappointing. Thought it was a good router at a decent price, until it started breaking down, regularly (shows red diagnostic light).Linksys website indicates that company knows about the problem, and will replace (only) if within warranty period. Technically within their rights, but seems unethical to me -- they sold a defective product and aren't taking the responsibility for it.Recommend you avoid this, and be careful about other Linksys products.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Woah!!. This book sums up the trilogy perfectly. Captivating from the beginning to the end, I have to blame this book for 2 - 3 late projects, but at the same time thank it for one of the most captivating reads i have had yet. The story was well paced and delivered with immaculate style. The constant swapping between caricatures was a stroke of genius, I was never left waiting and wondering what was happening with the many other caricatures.11/10, one of the best reads i have had for a long time$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great CD.. If you're looking for a great album with REAL music, this CD is for you. Sugarcult's music is very enjoyable & the lyrics are honest.

Disappointing read, wonderful appendices. I found this book difficult to get through. The first part (of what was to be a 5-part book) is choppy with superficial character treatments. What makes the work remarkable is the harrowing circumstances in which the author was writing. It's deeply tragic that this wonderful writer suffered and was murdered during WWII. The writing and storyline vastly improve in the 2nd book, and I believe if Nemirovsky had been able to revise and complete the novel, it would have been wonderful. As it stands, the book is rough and hard to digest. I do recommend this edition, however, because of the moving letters in the appendices written by Nemirovsky and her comtemporaries during the period leading up to and following her deportation. Those (not the fiction!) brought me to tears.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Rediscover Good Bread. I've been an amateur breadmaker for years, but tend to bake irregularly because of the effort involved. No more! Mark Miller's recipes for bread both plain and exotic, healthful and richly delicious, have rekindled my enthusiasm for bread. I'm baking almost all my own bread now and making breakfast and lunch special occasions. From genuine sourdough, comforting cornbreads, spicy cheesey flatbreads and foccacia, to tempting quickbreads and breakfast treats (try Cream Cheese and Blueberry Bread, or Scottish Scones with honey, cream and Drambuie) No tedious copying of recipes from a library book this time: there are so many delicious recipes (and I've tried a lot of them) that I need to buy this book!$LABEL$1,0,-100
I join the consensus. What's the point? This has been asked many times: Why was Psycho redone, scene by scene? I guess someone who did not see the original would find it intriguing and fascinating. And there are some more explicit skin scenes, a la post 1965, which do make it look more real. So it's not a total loss and maybe worth seeing, but probably not owning.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Works great BUT..... This works great. The size was such that I was able to cover my blueberry bushes and miniature apple trees completely. I used lawn staples to secure the netting around the perimeter of beds where they are planted. BUT, the squirrels still try to get underneath. My wife found one caught up in the netting that was bunched up.

"Arms" embraces the human heart. Upon finishing Ms. Boss's recent book of poems, I found myself identifying with the lengths to which a woman will go to please the men in her life. Instead of bemoaning this situation, she seems to infuse her words with an an ironic twist which brings a smile rather than a frown to one's face. It is hope instead of despair that survives; Laughter instead of tears; reason rather than insanity. It is perspective, which is comforting in these most uncomfortable of times between men and women. There are no villains in her stories, only flawed human beings who don't always make the right decisions at the right time. They try and that's what counts. Her poetry will make you think and feel and find solace in how far we've come and yet, how much farther we need to go in the area of man/woman relationships. It is a challenge any reader will be prepared to do after reading her work.$LABEL$1,0,-100

It was great...until it broke. Overall this is a great value mask, considering it is easy to adjust, has a tight seal and does not fog readily. But there's one problem...you can't use the mask when the straps break. After about 3 hours of use one of the straps broke. It still works, but the seal is not as tight, and is not quite as comfortable. It is probably only a matter of time before the other strap breaks too.

Most Helpful Book on the Subject. I have read many books on the power of creating your own reality, but I like this one the best. I do the meditations every day, and they make such a tangible difference in my life. I had lesions on my legs that wouldn't heal for months. I'd meditate every morning on healing them, and at night they would be noticably improved until they were healed. I have used the meditation to heal myself emotionally of extreme sadness and other strong emotions, I have used it to bring more financial opportunities into my life. After meditating, everything seems right, my problems seem to resolve themselves. This book is pleasing to read, as is all Dr. Dyer's material. I think of him as the father I never had.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Lame, Artsy Excuse for a Book.... The title does indeed say it all: Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales. The book stinks and the tales are stupid. I honestly feel like I have wasted my time for having read it. The only reason that I gave it two stars is that some of the art has creative redeeming value with the picture of the table of contents crashed, having some pages that are blank, and blanks spots where reluctant characters have run away. The art work and the text layout are worth studying. The text reads like a series of poorly executed campfire stories with the ugly duckng simply growing up to be an ugly duck and instead of having the sky not fall... the table of contents falls and crushes all of the characters in Chicken Licken...Crazy James$LABEL$0,0,-100

very interesting, insights both good and bad on polygamy. Annie Clark Tanner was an admirable person.

I appreciated the support and understanding she received from her children as they became adults. They had a wonderful mother. I am amazed at all she went through for her husband, without bitterness. However, she was open about her feelings, which let me know that she was "real". Thank you Annie, for writing about your life and sharing your experiences.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The Writing Process as a Fundamental Method of Learning. Although Zinsser's book may not have been exactly what I had expected, I found the concept of "writing across the curriculum" to be a fascinating and practical concept. I was reminded again of the importance of organizing, writing and rewriting if I want to produce good, clear writing.Advantages to the "W" concept include:* Motivation* Learning how to read to extract meaning out of the text* Learning to write using a personal writing style* Learning to use the process of asking questionsZinsser tells of his own journey as he explored the principles detailed in the writing of this book. I enjoyed his illustrations, analysis, and conclusions. Zinsser credits the many that provided information and inspiration into the writing formation of "Writing to Learn." This has been a true learning experience.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Watch for fit problems. If your vehicle's mirrors are a stationary fairing or housing with a pivoting mirror inside, you need to make sure that the mirror is well recessed in the housing on both top and bottom. The clips in the arms of this mirror need to extend into the housing about 1/4 inch, and they are fairly thick.When attached to the mirror on my 2008 Pathfinder it restricts the adjustment of the Pathfinder's mirror, forcing it to point down as the mirror is nearly flush with the housing on the bottom edge. I also found vibration to be a problem, perhaps partially due to the problems with the fit.On the plus side, it appears to be well constructed with plenty of adjustment in the straps, and my fit issues may affect other brands as well.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Snow White Rocks!!!. This version of the Grimms Brothers Fairy Tale is excellent. The digital transfer to DVD is so good that I felt like I could have walked right into my television set. Once again Signourey Weaver nails her performance as the wicked step-mom Claudia. All starts out fine but then things quickly pick up as step-mom and step-daughter battle it out to the final blow. This version is top knotch all the way, I was very pleased with everyone's performance, the movie's photography and storyline. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good suspenseful movie while reliving a childhood story at the same time. Also the chills are more from the suspense side and little to no emphasis on blood and gore. My only recommendation is that younger kids don't need to see this version unless you want them sleeping with you for a week. I give it my thumbs up rating as well.$LABEL$1,0,-100
I love this watch, but.... I really love this watch, but I hate the fact this baby retails for $4.450 and can be had for $4.075. A preowned one may cost you around $3.000. Some jewelers tell you that if you invest in this watch, you may get your money back withing 10 years. That never happened to me. If you think about it, it's like buying bonds from corporations and not receiving interest in return, just your money back! Are watch aficionados subsidizing Rolex? Is the cost of wearing a brand, tradition, and history on your wrist really worth that much? I can get an Omega Seamaster 300M GMT with automatic movement Cal. 1128 and COSC Chronometer Certification for $1.630. I would be buying into prestige, tradition, and history for 1/3 of the price. Is the Explorer II water resistant to 300M? I think not. So what's all the fuss? Yes, the Explorer II is a beater and a dressy watch at the same time with an outstanding craftsmanship.

A very long read that leads to an unintelligible ending.. This is a very long, static and redundant tale that comes to an abrupt conclusion that could cause mental whiplash. I am curious that the other reader/reviewers who have made entires here find the story and its sudden, odd and unlikely ending so fascinating. I re-read the last four pages several times with the hope that the meaning would dawn on me. I get the facts of the finale, just not the context in which they fit into this story. I consider myself an avid reader (and one who grasps the plots and nuances of writing) but this one makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever.

Dr Anne Andersen.

What a dog!. The working title for this film (shot in Nebraska in dead of winter) was, listen to this: Born to Loose! I know, I was there. The director (Eleanor Gaver) paid a producer (Jonathan Krane) to direct the film she had written--her first and last film. Michelle Johnson, hot off the "Blame it on Rio" movie was paid a lot to be in it, but she was a whining "bitch" who didn't care to be on this production. Can't blame her, no one did.

Does a good job softening new leather. But be careful if you are using it on newly dyed leather. I used it on a fresh dyed, but completely dry, piece of veg-tanned leather with contrasting stitching, and it caused the dye to bleed out and discolor the stitching a little.

Perfection. WOW, what a nice product. Within the first hour of it's arrival, I had to see if I could screw it up somehow as I would either under cook or over cook my rice. The very first use of this cooker boasted a very nice texture of rice. I cannot wait to continue making rice in the future. For those of you that are as inept as I was at cooking rice, I would highly recommend this cooker if you enjoy rice as much as I do.FYI, the rice I am using is Mahatma Jasmine$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great Business Lessons. Sacchi's book worked for me. I've been in my own business for 20years and never done a business plan,mainly because no one has make the case of why I really need one. Sacchi, not only makes a compelling case but makes it easy to develope. His real world examples and experience also lend to the simple yet important formula for building and redesigning a business in a purposeful way. My business will be more successful because of this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Disappointed - Again. The phone was very annoying. Everytime I tried to call on the phone, it would not connect. I would have to either change the channel or just not call. I was only able to connect to the number I was calling once in the 30+ times I attempted to call. I returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone.

Poor Product. This product is awful. It broke on the second use. I went out of my way not to over tighten anything. There is a long partiality threaded rod (piece with the hook on it) that ends in a plastic spreader. As you tighten down rod the friction applied to the spreader causes it break lose internally and push the rod all the way through the spreader. Causing a failure. (very poor design). Something like a BB on the end of the rod would have worked. The BB would have kept the drill through effect of the rod from happening (The end of the rod is so ragged I cut my finger just trying to get the spreader back on)$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great but not as great as it could be. If this game was not hyped as much as it was it would be wonderful. It is kind of like combining Morrowind and The Sims, but it's not as in-depth as either one. My major beef with this game is its legnth. If it was on the PC it would definitely have an expansion pack coming out in a few months. The other beef that everyone has is that it doesn't live up to its hype, what videogame ever does?$LABEL$1,0,-100
Wow. I received this album from a fellow jazz musician now playing in Shanghai, & while my expectations were not that great, boy was I in for a surprise! Francesco Cafiso, now 23, was, in my opinion, another Paul Desmond. I'm not impressed by the fact that he was an accomplished alto man at an early age. Most great jazz musicians usually are.I'm going to keep this short, & just tell you that what impressed me most was the maturity he showed in his handling of a ballad. In the business of jazz we say that "anyone can learn to play fast, but it's the ballads that separate the men from the boys." I was most taken by his work on "Polka Dots and Moonbeams." His handling of "My Old Flame" was absolutely gorgeous as well.If you are a sax lover, you'll find that there is MUCH on this album to love. I recommend it very highly.$LABEL$1,0,-100

This is a great game if you know how to understand read words to you and know how to use the mouse you would be able to play.. This is a game where you are Erika and you have to complete many deeds in order to become the queen in three days. So, you have to complete all these tasks which requires you to go all over the town.You get to bake cakes, take care of a kitten, grow flowers, and much,much more.This is probably a great game for a kid ( probably a girl) who is at the age where she knows how to basicaly can understand words ( read to her) and knows how to use a mouse.This is a really fun game but, as you get older you might still like it at the age of nine you don't have to like the Princess and the Pauper to play this game.[...]$LABEL$1,0,-100
mccartney is poorly represented!. Please buy this if you are likely to enjoy a completely sycophantic deluded lesson on the greatness of john lennon as a solo artist then this is the dvd for you.any mention of mccartney's work is not only severly biased but far too slightly covered.the truth is lennon missed mccartney as much as the other way around,indeed possibly much more.john lennons early 1970s work is totally overated here whilst paul mccartney's is totally underated.this is not a balanced view and a a pretty miserable beatles docu.i do believe the next in the series covering their work from 1973-1980 is actually being released this week [nov2011].it will be interesting to see the 'lennon spin' his hero worshipers put on his miserable output during this period whilst mccartney went on to become the biggest selling artist in the world all over again.!$LABEL$0,0,-100

WARNING: Not creme-de-la-creme Paris chillout.. I first became addicted to chillout music when I heard Cafe del Mar 8 playing at a record store in NYC. Since then, I've become an avid collector and somewhat of an afficianado.I bought "Paris Lounge" based on its very positive reviews. But compared to Cafe del Mar, Hotel Costes, and the magnificent Buddha Bar series, this collection does not make the grade. There are some good samplings here, but all in all, it is uneven, badly mixed, and often way too weird to be even listenable, let alone enjoyable.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Don't let the title fool you.... This book is superb, and covers so much more than the two style trends mentioned in the title. Many people relegate Biedermeier style to the 19th century, yet this book covers design trends from the Renaissance onward, as it evolved in Germanic lands. The breadth of interiors covered, the quality of the photos, the writing, this book has it all. I see that it went through two different permutations of the dust jacket, possibly in an effort to attract buyers. I think it is the title that throws potential buyers off. This book is essential for those wishing to know more about German interiors as they evolved over time, as well as a great sourcebook of ideas to be adapted to modern-day interiors. Buy this book, you will not be sorry.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Do not buy!. I bought this griddle for the obvious benefits of requiring less storage and the ability to run two temperatures at the same time. The drawback to the griddle is that any time it is used the grease does not make it to the grease catching cup, intead it leaks right out onto the counter surface. This is a huge mess!

Not What I Expected. I bought this CD after being seeing them on TV (60 minutes), and being a bluegrass / trad. country fan I bought it. However, they sound very little like they were made out to be in both online reviews and on TV (i.e. bluegrass or old school country). While great musisians, most of the songs sound very similar and "popish" - you can't hear any of their great banjo or Dobro in all but one or two of the songs on the CD.

No Respect in Those Days. Very well known film shown a zillion times in the nuclear navy. This is a good example of the scientific lack of respect for the power and diversity of the types of problems that could occur during the testing and experimentation of reactor plants. It always stuck in my mind during the 70's and 80's when I operated and managed commercial nuclear plants.

What a Disappointment!. I recently picked up a VHS copy of this at a local thrift store for almost nothing. Having never seen it, I was looking forward to an exciting 3-hour musical. What a disappointment! Virtually the entire film lacked consistency and cohesiveness. Though some of the musical numbers were quite good, the acting on the part of Richard Harris and Vanessa Redgrave was unimpressive. Overall, the film was very labored and there was little to connect one scene to another. If you want a truly excellent rendition of King Arthur and the knights of the round table, get a copy of the 1997 film, First Knight starring Sean Connery, Richard Gere and Julia Ormond. The acting is first rate and the film is filled with action and does not drag along like Camelot does.

The plates are worth the price of the book. The primary reason I buy the Osprey books are for the color plates. More often than not, the author, Rene Chartrande goes into obscure detail that adds little to the text. Like many of his other works, Chartrande does not reveal enough useful sources. Photographs of exhisting uniforms and equipment are helpful, but if these were in color v.s. black and white, it would enhance these books. Chartrande cranks out numerous books for Osprey, but it's looking more like he's going for quantity over quality. Chartrande should go back to the style and depth of his older works.$LABEL$0,0,-100
The worst book about the adult experience I've ever read!. I began this book with much anticipation. After the first chapter, I was offended and disappointed. But I kept reading hoping it would get better. It didn't. The author interviews only 45 women and bases his theories on loosely held evidence. I don't know how I am going to finish this book, but I have to becausee it's a required text for a college course.

A contemporary story that teaches children values!. Finally, a story about teaching our children values, manners and self respect. I have been looking for a entertaining story to read to my toddlers that instill some of the values that my husband and I want our children to grow up with. Magical Chango was given to me by my mother, who knew that in today's society values were not being taught to children. We are so involved with our fast-paced lives that we tend to forget to stop and teach our children the very basics of civility. (P) Magical Chango is my gift to our children. Through a wonderful magical tale, my children are able to envision our teachings to them. The great part is, they just think its fun. Chango gives my children, through their imagination, the enpowerment to respect themselves and eventually as they grow older all others around them. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to instill values, insight, and manners into our precious gift, the children.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Classic. Before the DVD, I watched this movie a long time ago. I enjoyed it more this time. To label this a horror movie may not be correct.

She is NOT that kind!. She's not... this blond & amazing woman is the hottest thing in the music industry these days. If you expected another good looking blond woman who can't sing- you are SO wrong. Anastacia is different. Not only she is pretty; she has an amazing voice & amazing vocal qualities. This mix-up of good looks instead talent reminds Christina Aguilera- beautiful & vocal talented. Like Christina, Anastacia has a great R&B album, & she even wrote some of the songs. Her voice is so strong & unique & that is something you just can't ignore. The pearl of this album is definitely the beautiful & so-very-special balled, Who's Gonna Stop The Rain. Not only that the music & Anastacia's voice are both amazing, the words are very deep, special & makes you think of this world. Other great tracks are Black Roses, I'm Outta Love, Not That Kind & lots more. Conclusion, buy this album. I guaranty that it will be one of the best buys you'd make.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Excessively Mundane and Bizzare. This was a most disappointing book. It had an extreme amount of quotes from P&P and I tired of reading what P&P fans already knew. I expected a new story, not re-runs. I was also disappointed because we had so little time with Jane and Bingley. The author's plots were bizarre and unlikely. All of the quicky relationships and weddings were uninteresting and unrealistic. Caroline Bingley staying with the Darcys? Mary at Rosings? Kitty as Godmother? I was hoping to read about Elizabeth as mistress of Pemberly but our time was wrapped up in another "traumatic" (mundane is more like it) episode with the Wickams. Couldn't the author come up with her own ideas? Don't waste your time on this weak attempt.

Wonderfully Ingenious. A must see movie. The movie is both innovative and sexy. Shabana and Nandita (the actresses) are sensational. Shabana Azmi is a feminist, a great actress and a member of the Indian parliament. The struggle depicted in the movie is not just something Indian or south asian women face, women all around the world face opression - only the details are different. While this is an excellent movie you should be aware that India is a diverse culture and you cannot represent the people in that culture with some of the generic statements that other reviewers have made here. There are several flavors of middle class India. Many Indian middle class women have excellent careers both in and outside the home and find partners (men and women) who believe in the equality of sexes. There are excellent women scientists, homemakers, engineers, doctors, teachers, members of parliament, etc. who have a great sense of self respect - self respect is not unique to western women :-)$LABEL$1,0,-100
router reboots and will get the boot soon. My first WBR-2310 kept rebooting until it just stopped working. Dlink connected me to India, I sat on hold for 20 minutes until my call was dropped as it was answered by them. I went through that 3 times and came extremely close to smashing the router. I decided it would be better just to exchange it for a new one. Now I am on my second router and having similar issues (not quite as bad but still rebooting quite often). I would never buy a dlink router again.

Sentimental romantic gay fiction. I first read the Loon series when they came out and I was impressed by 1) the correct English, 2) the sympathy for gay characters, 3) portrayal of Indian gay love, and 4) the erotic fiction. There are classical references which I find laughable but I guess someone else might find them romantic. The poetry is not very good, but I appreciate Richard Amory's attempts. Throughout the books the theme is how a young white man learns to accept his gay orientation through meeting and having sex with Indians and older white males. His 2 other books are also good. The movie was pretty bad.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The Way Of Harmony. Dr. Dreaver's book, "The Way Of Harmony", is appropriately named. It provides useful guidance for living a balanced life in language that is simple, direct and accessible. Drawing on the wisdom of ancient teaching traditions, this book provides practical guidance for meditation and other tools which are needed for living well while maintaining our relationship to spirit.I highly recommend this book both for the novice and experienced seekers alike. For the novice it offers new insights into old problems which have not responded well to traditional western approaches. For those who already have some experience with meditation and the search for balance, this book offers an excellent review and reminder of things already learned.$LABEL$1,0,-100

This helps normalize the complex feelings of the young widow.. It was very cathartic to read this well written book.

A Disappointment. When I bought this cd, I was pretty excited. The movie had been great and I really enjoyed the music. This soundtrack, however, was a disappointment. Most of the songs are cheesy and boring, with ultra pop-styled lyrics. There are a few songs that are good, but only because they're the same as they were in the movie. Most of the others were redone and poorly so.

So needless to say it is no god to me now I dont dare leave it on all night for fear it will short out or something like that. I only use it in my bed room at night and that is it so it is not used 24 7 so it has not been beat on. I bought a new one of a diffrent brand and have not had a problem with it .

I have owned my Delta Sander for several months- bought due to the favorable review in one of my woodworking magazines.Problems:Mechanism to elevate table is flawed. Cog belt constantly slips- I have spent whole days just trying to get table parallel. Table is diffuclt to raise and lower. Called customer service a few times but they were of limited help= suggested I take to service center. At nearly 200 lbs this is somewhat impractical.Motor must be removed to replace cog belt- not a one person job- motor is very heavy.No way to avoid snip.Tool might be good for small jobs- like crafts- but working with even small panel doors leads to disappointing results.I have many delta tools in my shop- love them all except this one.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Like Reading for Fun!. Learning cultural anthropology through this book is a joy ride. When I was reading, it actually felt like I was reading a New York Times Bestseller! This book captures you attention and it is never boring. I had to read this book for my intro to anthropology class and you can only imagine how fun studying for this class was. I've learned so much from it and I would read it again when I have the time!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Strong and Stylish. I used this to mount my 52" Samsung LCD and it isplenty strong enough. Takes a bit of planning to install, but if you are careful it is no big problem. I use ti to swing the TV at it far extent to view from the Kitchen and it works great and seems to have no problems. Looks good too with the arms extended due to the finish.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Good ideas...but that's it. I gave this one 2/5 because it does have some original ideas, otherwise I would have given it lower. The movie has a great idea going...it's just not implemented well...or should I say, in a horror fashion. I know a lot of people in reviews like to say "the ideas weren't implemented well" but that's really the only thing I could think. Bulbous, protruding phallus members belonging to homicidal maniacs? Bring it on, I said. Unfortunately, this one has the vulgarity and nudity typical to most of my favorite horror movies, but not enough gore and too many alterations to make the reader try to feel the effects of whatever drugs these kids were on. So, while the film didn't "bring it on," per se, it'll definitely be one I'll be thinking about in the near future...so I'll know what to avoid.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Best Biography I've ever Read. I knew nothing about Peter the Great going into this book but feel as if I lived alongside him in the Russian Empire. Great book.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Very dissapointed. I bought this title in hopes that the Synergy version of this movie would have fixed the missing sound effects track which was missing on the WB version. Well it wasn't there. So do yourself a favor and don't buy this version of the DVD if you want to get the missing sound effects track.Will somebody ever fix this!!!???$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great score, silly show.. This is a classic example of a bad show with a great score. The rather silly plotline and the quiet intimacy of the show guaranteed its quick demise on Broadway (although it was a success in London), but this CD documents what I would consider one of Webber's finest scores. It is intimate, subtle, almost a chamber musical in a way. Not at all what one would expect from this composer. Michael Ball is stunning in the lead role, and the remaining cast members perform beautifully. Several stand-out songs and an overall feeling of grace and old-world style should assure this score's survival, despite its less-than-stellar Broadway stage history.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Pride and Prejudice. I have the video of one of the older versions of the movie and I also have the cd of the most recent movie. I love both of them so much that I had to get the book since it gives you more of an indebt of the thoughts etc. of the characters.I love the book$LABEL$1,0,-100
