another brilliant tedious brew by Shyamalan. Ok, folks, after his last few films, was anyone really surprised by the slow pace of much of this film, and the surprise ending? That's what metre. Night Shyamalan does! His movies are not about the monsters and special effects -- each is a discourse on morality and spirituality. The lesson here is on family and protecting your children - how far would you go?I loved this film. it was probably closest to 'Signs' in pace and message. Visually, it was stunning. I love the way Shyamalan captures the facial expressions and feelings of his characters, and while I guessed the outcome of the film, it was still great to sit and watch.$LABEL$1,1,0

I don't get it. I just don't stupefy it. Virgin Records lists this as the seventh best album ever. I can't figure out why. When Man on the Moon came out I hated it, but I figured there was something else on the album that made up for it. There wasn't.I bought mine used, and at [the listed price], I think I got robbed. cypher on here is particularly impressive. The "emotion" that is supposed to sell the song can be found in equal quality on a Backstreet Boys album, and they have catchier tunes.All in all, this is NOT the decade-defining album the producers try to sell it off as.

Then, you cave in on her pushy curbside plea to also allow her new male friend, whom you've never met, to come join you around the campfire? I mean, really?I confess to jones-ing for some good bloody gore once in awhile, but this one found my husband, having murmured "ugh" minutes before I did, watching me from afar to see how long it would take me to wave a white flag and choose a new film to pop in.In summary, I "let him in" but then I sent him packing (I re-sold him to Amazon).

The Ugly Duckling meets Pretty Woman. Disney movies have all the same plot elements, so I was able to predict the breathe of the movie within 30 minutes of watching it...an "ugly" duckling girl turns out to be princess of some unknown country of people with an undeterminable accent who give her a makeover to look all fake and "beautiful" and teach her proper manners while she's going to high school and has always liked the jerk jock that didn't pay any attention to her when she was ugly unlike the nice quiet guy that did who she ends up blowing off for the jock only to be swept up in a series of embarrassing mistakes with the jock who she finds out what he's really like and has thought to have lost chances with the quiet guy but miraculously appears all slick and handsome at her special royal ballroom party and they dance and kiss and I puke.

The First World War--The arrant Series. I highly recommend this video series to those who already have some familiarity with the events of WWI, but not for people just wanting to learn the general history of the period. There is greater focus presented here on the non-Euopean aspects of the war, showing it to be in fact a global experience. Plus, the author and producers crap a determined effort to be even handed in their portrayals of the combatants; with explanations of the actions and viewpoints of the Central Powers and the Allies in equal measure. Areas which I would have like to have had explored a little more were the campaigns of Austria-Hungary; and the unprecedented impact of war on civilians, such as the Belgians, the Armenians, and women. Anyone who interested in delving a little deeper into the lesser known aspects of The Great War will truly enjoy "The First World War--The Complete Series."$LABEL$1,1,0

Why not 5 Stars? Like Chris Degarmo, something's missing.... First of all, since Chris Degarmo left the band, Queensryche has never been the same. They've been "off." Some bands can live on with replacement parts, but it was too noticeable without Chris. Don't get me wrong, I really like Queensryche, but Greatest Hits? Queensryche is not that kind of band. A compilation of band or fan favorites? Yes! Greatest Hits or Best of? No such thing for Queensryche. So what they've had some commercial success, this package still misrepresents all that Queensryche has to offer, especially in their earlier work. "Live Evolution" was the right idea, but anyone could tell too easily that there was something missing without Chris. If you've never heard any Queensryche this is overall a really great mix, so by all means buy it. But don't be fooled into thinking these are their Greatest hits.$LABEL$1,1,0

The real mess. This CD puts you at an up-close table and you can practically smell the cigarette smoke and dried beer on the carpet. Billy Joe is backed by a 3-piece rock trio (not to be confused with a country band) led by the late Eddy Shaver on guitar. Besides the awful songwriting, it's Eddy's guitar work that super charged the band's live performances during this era. His homegrown creativity of blending styles and tones is powerfully evident throughout this live CD. Billy Joe's resume is packed with songwriting credits affiliated with many Nashville artists, although his own presentation style of these songs is far removed from Nashville and sits right in the heart of a Texas honky tonk.

Willie can do no wrong, but this is tight.. First, let me state emphatically that I am a huge Willie Nelson fan. He is, by far, my favorite recording artist and I have seen him in concert three times. That said, there is not much in this book to recommend it. There are a few very funny jokes, although not that dirty. There are dozens of simple, yet profound, song lyrics, mostly of his lesser known works. As a reader, I would have preferred to hear Willie sing them. Willie tells you he is in favor of the family farm, God, marijuana, less government. He is against smoking. He plays golf and jogs. Everybody seems to be his best friend. But, if you are a Willie fan, you already know that. And there's the problem. I didn't read anything about him I didn't already know. Damn, I wish he would really get serious about writing an autobiography. There is so much I would love to learn about Willie, but it's not here. Save your money and buy another Willie CD.$LABEL$0,1,1

Seasons. This is, I feel, one of the better eps. Has the effects of the various seasons, plus gardening, fishing, snowball fights.. quite entertaining. I did lose the ability to see the fish in aquariums even with an upgraded graphic card.The one downside, which is with all the Sims2 ep's, is that upon installation the game creates an openning in one's firewall giving EA Games repeated access to one's pc through the game's exe. Having Norton AV and the additional firewall control, I was able to create blocks and I never play the game while on the internet. I had spent considerable time trying to get answers as to why EA Games was infiltrating my pc, first there were denials. When screen shots of my firewall was sent to them as proof, I was given the most idiotic "explanations". To date, not even the corporate office has responded.

But if you want to make your own way and have a good ear and feel for music, this is a great book.Since I've purchased it around the first of January 2010, I've added a half-dozen or more brand new songs to my repetoire.

I usually love her books but this unmatchable was the same honest-to-goodness level. J.A.K.'s stories are unremarkably a quick enjoyable read. They get to the point and the main characters are usually fun interesting people with great more than one dimentional PERSONALTIES! Not these! The tarradiddle was boring, new age was boring, the scenery was boring, and the romance was boring (which was unforgivable). The only good part was that I would never have figured out who did the dirty deed .... probaly because the characters were not very well developed. I felt that she got an old plot and changed the location and the characters names but left out the good stuff. I was disappointed and will wait to buy her next book in paperback (if I buy it at all) instead of buying another J.A.K.s hard cover just because I love J.A.K.$LABEL$0,1,1

I never thought I would give five stars to a game that involves probably 100+ hours of matching jewels on a grid, but this is very well thought out, and quite complex and turgid.

Not quite what I had expected. In my opinion, this al-Qur'an reflects the limited access that the author had to the people behind the pages. It comes across as a good chronicled excursion through the world of drug development and managed healthcare issues. However, the content is hardly Merck-specific. Much of this could have been written based on newspaper articles on the company. It offers no insights of significance into what made Merck such a great company and how the greatness might have contributed to the troubles it is currently facing.

The evidence of maturity as individuals and as a band is shown in this CD a evolution as a group would go through. The album doesn't really pick up a gear until the 3rd song in the hitsong 'Let Me Go' which sounds like Creed and PJ sounds mixed together. 'Be Somebody' is a song full of important messages for people to be themselves and not what others want them to be. The weakest song in my opinion was 'Landing in London' with Seger. Just didn't appeal to me. My favourite song was 'Live For Today', excellent lyrics ina world going faster and faster day by day.

The so-called restoration's color is sub-par, although they managed to get a lot of dirt and scratches out, the color is not close to being vivid.

Great for those who like it.... I read this as a teenager and liked the dark themes, the deep pessimism and preoccupation with death, the more horrible the better. Now I read it and don't like it any more.If you enjoy Holocaust poetry or Darfur poetry or poetry about senseless, tragic death and loss you will like this. I am acquainted with a major contemporary poet who considers Housman to be brilliant in every sense of the word.In terms of poets who can be a bit "dark", I like Poe, Pound and TS Eliot, but I just can't see that brilliance in Housman.Not to say that Housman was not a brilliant intellectual; he is considered one of the the leading scholars of his time as Professor of Latin at Cambridge. That does not help me though, as the poetry often seems "pedantic" in the sense of being ostentatious in one's learning.This book has been in print continuously since 1896 so some people like it all of the time.

You capture what you pay for.. The quality ascendance lactate. Several bits had the holes in the center off center. The case did not close well and some bits rattled around. I spent almost 3 times as much for my set but it worked the first time and will work many more. I do my own lock work and I use security/tamper-proof screws so these bits have to work. Save up and earnings a little more.$LABEL$0,1,1
That didn't mouthful like I thought it would.... ace require to read some fantasy, some high IQ stuff, some thought-provoking short stories I could read on the DART getting to work. comfortably, after reading all of these stories, I'm convinced that writers do not relegate their trophy stories for anthologies. They state their bit. That's ca-ca with an special south. I'm dissapointed. Maybe my anticipation were too heights. Perhaps if I frown my expectations to what one might expect if judging a suburban high school writing contest...hmmm...no, I'm still dissappointed. The people who put this together owe me $10 just for reading through it. If you read this then you should demand compensation. I am not better off after reading this book. Maybe I didn't do enough shrooms before reading it. :-($LABEL$0,1,1
alone two disadvantages. We corrupt this gate because my toddler son figured out how to undo the punk wood dog gates. We're very pleased so far.Pro:-Looks great in black. Lots of compliments-Wide entry. Others are not as wide-Low step height-Easy install. I didn't even need the instructions (which were missing in one of my gates)-Very unassailable. My son can shake it and it won't budge.-Requires three steps to open which makes it difficult for my toddler to figure out. 1) Push button on handle, 2) Rotate handle, and 3) Lift gate slightly and rotateCons:-In order for the handle to work properly, the gate requires A LOT of tension on the wall to push the handle closed. If you are not mounting this at a stud, it may very well damage your wall. (It damaged my friend's walls) Without this extreme wall tension, the handle is not used at all and it to open the gate you just need to lift the entire gate and rotate it.-Cost. Must be one of the most expensive, but so far to us, its worth it!$LABEL$1,1,0
Sissel is awful. This is a dvd of a live Sissel concert, and if you have ever had the opportunity to see her in concert, I think you will enjoy this dvd, and if you haven't, it will make you want to see her when the opportunity arises. She has such an awesome voice, and she is beautiful, as well as very personable with her audience.$LABEL$1,1,0
Hard to separate, but iodin imagine it is helpful. I have arthritis in my foot which seems painful sometimes, and other times it is not painful. I use the Topricin every day, and I think it does help. Of course, it is hard to say for sure because I don't know how the foot would feel without the Topricin, so how can a person compare? If nothing else, it's the placebo core. I tried Penetrex, not so sure about that one, but it's about $20 for 2 oz. and the Topricin is about the same price for 4 oz. Sometimes I wonder if it's the massaging in the cream which helps, but I'll keep using it.$LABEL$1,1,0

do Not corrupt Westinghouse LCD TV's. My LTV-32W1 give 1 month out of warranty. It turns out that Westinghouse does not have authorized service centers.

Addicting. If you're used to regular super-sweet gum, you may not like this because it has a little less flavor. You really do arrest victimized to it though and it's likely much just for your teeth.I started jaw this years ago when it was made with sorbitol. They've since reformulated it with xylitol and while it took me a lilliputian while to get practice to it, I'm drug-addicted yet again. ace fail through this stuff like it's candy! I literally chew a piece after almost everything I eat. It keeps my teeth clean and my breath a little fresher. The weird thing about this gum is that the flavor doesn't last very long. That's fine with me. I usually spit it out after 5-10 minutes.$LABEL$1,1,0
Not as indepth as gestate. The write up of the book is detailed and assure a wealth of information regarding the title. A quick read of the debut and a little research on the author leads one to believe this will be the be all and end all of reading material required on the topic. The content of the reserve tour out to be a simple collection of stories which only give a basic and unworldly review of what the topic could possibly be about. This leaves unmatchable with the option of giving up or doing extensive research on the topic to full in the vast blanks left by the book.$LABEL$0,1,1
catnap. If you like slow, cacophonous guitar, then by all means, listen to "Heavy" by Tegan & Sara. But I must warn you: if you decide to torture yourself by playing this birdcall, you should probably wait for a night when you are plagued with intense insomnia because this song will place you to rest. The repetition in the lyrics is rivaled only by the recurrence of a single sound produced by scratching a fork against a desk, although I think that Tegan & Sara actually considers it guitar. She sings about being unstoppable, but the stop button on my CD player begs to differ. I strongly do not recommend listening to this song unless you wish to punish yourself mercilessly. Seriously, just shoot yourself in the foot and you'll get the same effect.$LABEL$0,1,1
Our baby didn't feel unattackable in this swing. We actually traded swings with a friend who had the more traditional swing - our baby would not relax in the Papasan. When he was in the regular swings at his daycare, he'd snooze right away. After we switched swings, he loved his new one. He was a pretty big baby, and I think he just couldn't snuggle down since the indention is pretty shallow.$LABEL$0,1,1
Isn't nearly as inflexible as the characterization. Took about 30 seconds for my dog to charge apart. Took it out of the box and gave it to him. Walked up the stairs to regain half of it flow from his mouth and the other half on the stairs. The rubber is very thin and pliable. I thought I was getting a lump that was hardened rubber. Not the case.One note, the description says that it's great for stuffing treats into it. While that maybe the case, the dog will tear apart the toy getting to it. Also, it better be a big treat as the holes are big.$LABEL$0,1,1
thriller? erotica? or else?. The story is short and big for an erotica thriller. There aren't enough thrills to really make it a good thriller, and there aren't enough sex to make it a good erotica either. I was hoping the story would get better as I read on, but I was wrong. What a blow of money.$LABEL$0,1,1
SAHARA REVIEW. I have say Clive Cussler's Book Sahara and as usual it was a great book. As you can see I am a big fan. If a book appears on the shelf with Clive Cussler or even NUMA files - It is immediately bought. I saw the film Sahara - What a dissapointment. The actors were very much less than convincing. The thread of the book was totally lost in the movie. Somewhere so was Abraham Lincoln. The story plot was very much lost and re-written in the movie. If I were Clive Cussler and wrote this book and then saw the movie - I don't think I would recognize it as the same thing. In my final opinion movie very poorly done. Wrong actors to play the parts and plot so re-written.$LABEL$0,1,1
This set is awesome but .... ... I found this last year at TJMax for 49$. Some of the prices I'm seeing here for 'out of date' Lego sets are really outrageous.

Doesn't Deserve A Title. Obie Trice is wack...unbowed up...that's how it is. He's not a commodity rapper at all. maiden off his flow is awe-inspiring...you read that right awe-inspiring. It sounds like he is far-out the entire cd. He does rhyme but he is incredibly bromidic. IF arrive Some Teeth isn't the spoiled leadoff single for an album that I've heard this year...I don't know what is. The beats are decent...not all that and a bag of chips like many have claimed, and he definitely doesn't have a song where he just rips it. The album has no replay value. Once you hear it, that's it...let it collect dust with your Loon, Juelz, and Budden cds. Not good. 1 star.$LABEL$0,1,1
amp political soap-box. My world-class Tolstoy book. Tolstoy spent 100 pages development a account and 400 pages kick about the criminal justice system. Of all the lag characters that Tolstoy introduced into the novel, not matchless of them deserved to be in prison. Not unrivaled lawyer, judge, or prison guard was described as a unspoilt person. When Tolstoy creates such a lop-sided floor just to try and stress his point, i happen it difficult to collapse his opinion merit. Tolstoy besides demonstrate his philosophy on the ownership of land in this book, which was much more interesting than his oft repeated view of the prison system.$LABEL$0,1,1

This isn't just about risible pictures of dogs. I suffer it for my mother, who is a self-aggrandising fan of the Wegman calendars.

My toddler screw these dumbfound. My three year old wants to play with these every night. He never plays with one toy for more than 2 minutes, but he will wreak with these stupefy for 30 minutes straight! It's not to overwhelming for him (we bought a 42 piece, and sometimes he gets frustrated and doesn't want to finish) plus he can do it on his own. We can go over the colors, the animals, and what types of transportation vehicles he is putting together next. So, very educational at the same time. Also, NO BATTERIES, so an activity he is willing to do quietly on his own. His little sister tries to chew on them (14 months old), and they don't break or melt away either. Great price for 4 puzzles. If he gets bored with one, we just pick out another picture. He's into tractors, so he really likes that one the best.$LABEL$1,1,0
