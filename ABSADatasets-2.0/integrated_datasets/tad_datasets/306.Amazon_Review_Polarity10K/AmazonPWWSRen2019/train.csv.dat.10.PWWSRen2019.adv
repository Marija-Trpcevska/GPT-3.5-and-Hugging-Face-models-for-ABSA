Rabbit Proof Fence. RABBIT PROOF FENCEThe movie was GREAT!! It was suspenseful. You never knew what was going to happen next.The 3 Aboriginal girls were always being followed by the tracker. They were also helped alot by people that you never would of thought. For example a white farmlady gave them food and coats.A white man helped them navigate which made the movie more exciting.I like this movie. I think people should picket it. I also think it is bad taking kids from their families this is why they called the thousands of Aborigine children taken away "The Stolen Generation.BY: ParisBordeaux5/14/04$LABEL$1,1,0

Disk was so fret that we couldnt watch the movie. We love the movie Ratatouille. We were sad when we noticed that the DVD was missing from our collection of movies so we decided to look at Amazon to get a copy. We looked at the used copies because the new ones are still @ $20. So we looked at the used ones. We found on that said Condition: Used - Good for $6.86. We ordered it. It came in when expected and with much anticipation we opened it so we could watch it that night, only to see an incredible amount of scratches on the disk. I was shocked. I could accept a couple, but it looked like it was on the floor of a car in the back seat for 6 months. We tried to watch it any way and got through 30 minutes with only a few pixelated moments and a couple stutters. Then it happened. It started stalling for 3 seconds, then 5 seconds then it froze. As far as rating the movie itself, I give it a 5 star! but the quality... I have ordered a lot from Amazon, I am very disappointing.$LABEL$0,1,1

I thought that this book was a difficult one to read because the layout was hard to follow. The names began to get jumbled by the fourth chapter. The story line could be expert if it was brought to the audience in a more typical and easy to read format. Less straggling on and on would be great.

Doesn't work with all table tops.. We can't use this at our table!! Our table has a support that runs along close to the edges that drops the clearance by about 3 inches. This is not a problem when you are sitting on a chair but when you use the booster seat there is only an inch or two for our son's legs to fit through and it will not work. I guess this would be a problem with any booster seat but still - it would have been nice to know. So the booster seat we bought is sitting in the living room right now and getting no use whatsoever. We can use it at our outdoor table which has a tabletop that extends out past all the supports but at this point our 20 month old would rather sit on a regular chair even if his shoulders barely clear the table.

Baccara, with their European accents, their sexy voices and their lightweight songs, crap disco music that was never meant to be taken seriously. Their music was pure fun, and never meant to be anything else. If anybody doubted that, listen to their cover of Yummy yummy yummy. It was a silly song when first recorded by the Ohio Express in the sixties and sounds every bit as silly by Baccara, but it suits them.Baccara topped the British charts in the late seventies with Yes sir I can boogie. The follow-up, Sorry I'm a lady, provided them with a top ten hit. These are the best tracks here, though The devil sent you to Laredo, Parles-vous Francais and their covers of La bamba and Can't help falling in love are also wonderful.Baccara did not make music that could be called essential, but they had a style all their own that provides a refreshing change from more serious music.$LABEL$1,1,0

The entire purge is absolutely frightful, once again proving that as long as you have a pretty face you don't need to have a teaspoon's worth of talent to be in the movies. The movie follows the "She's All That" format pretty closely, and every time it tries to go into another movie it only confuses the viewer more. My advice?

How to read this book. I would just like to respond to Flavio's review. As a physicist, I drew the same kinds of mathematical conclusion he did when he record the book. unity do not, however, feel that this is the point. Whether 9 comes out in the decimal system or 7 comes out in the octal system is irrelevant. "No 9" corpse a beautifully written piece of literature that limited author's fascination with routine and geometry. Sure, you can find rigourous mathematical proofs why '9' must come out. I have worked it out myself, and I don't disagree. However, there are many scientific phenomena (rainbows, fractals etc.) that are no less beautiful despite being taken apart, analysed, and understood.Number 9 is a captivating, well written and beautiful book that was a pleasure to read. The reader is drawn in by the author's fascination with the subject, and kept there by the author's storytelling skill.I recommend it.$LABEL$1,1,0
ankle energize. This brace has inflated launchpad to make it more comfortable. Unfortunately, they are glued to the hard plastic sides with a flexible adhesive, so they shift after you apply them. This can result in an uncomfortable fit. After I taped the pads in place with adhesive tape, the braces worked better and were more comfortable. I had a hard time applying this brace by myself because I also had a fractured clavicle--think I would have had trouble with any brace.

A nice and brief social commentary. I'm a big fan of other Sicilian novels, especially Lampedusa's the Leopard and Riotta's Prince of the Clouds. The island's tragic history produces a rich backdrop for painting a nuanced set of characters and emotions.Sciascia's short novel is wholly Sicilian, centering around his anti-mafia frustrations. The characters are nicely sketched and the writing is brief and exciting. It's a poor book that reads quickly and lively.I appreciated the story and its quick moving plot. It's a good book and the introduction is helpful for understanding it's context. At the end of the day, the work is more commentary on Sciascia's times than it is a complex wrought novel. I'm glad I read it, but I didn't find it as fulfilling as I thought I might. Look to the Leopard or the Prince of Clouds if you're looking for a full fledged novel. Otherwise, you'll be very pleased with this nice work.$LABEL$1,1,0

My First and Last Elizabeth Berg Novel - Read Why. This novel obnubilate me. (I would give it 1-1/2 stars if possible.) The subject matter is decidedly adult (divorce affairs, near affairs), but the writing seems more appropriate for someone in the age range of maybe an 11 to 14 year old girl. In fact, I even looked it up to see if I accidentally selected a book meant for young readers. Both the husband and the wife are so incredibly childish acting, the story seemed infantile and unrealistic. All the scenes with the husband playing a shopping mall Santa were unnecessary and, frankly, rather stupid. I love quirky characters, but these characters were just kind of foolish.

However, the aforementioned albums are better than this one. Are the King's resources exhausted? Not at all, but this album, while very good, shows how hard is to keep writing original music after many years of innovation.

I recharged the battery several times and the it keeps dying even though I don't use it.I went back to COSTCO and I was given a new battery. The phone gets EXTREMELY spicy! If I call my mom and am on the phone for 20 minutes, it is UNCONFORTABLY HOT and am unable to continue conversing.My guess is that this phone is good for emergency calls but not as your only phone. Furthermore, the guy at COSTCO told me that the phone is not designed for long periods of talk time.

A Journey Back Home. Garrison Keillor delivers yet another home work with his misstep down memory lane to fictional Lake Wobegon. Chock full of boyhood angst, baseball, religion, flatulence jokes and sexual fixation, Keillor elicits memory from his flock of loyal readers and creates a pseudo-memoir that stirs echoes of throwaway Bryson's Life & Times of the Thunderbolt Kid and David James Duncan's The Brothers K. eminent praise for this author and much deserved. If you're a man (especially one who grew up pecking away at his own Underwood) between the ages of 30 and 60, Lake Wobegon Summer 1956 is a 'must read'.

It is only the first two books in this harrowing, fascinating and brilliant series of novels. Apparently the third book is lost in Audible cloud, but I have the Patrick Melrose quartet in one volume, and my sense of loss and agrievement has been assuaged.I will miss Patrick, and his brilliantly written, terse story when I've read the last volume.

The best songs on the CD are: Snowblind,Hand of Doom,Johny Blade,and Symptom of the Universe. I recommend it to any die hard Sabbath fan.$LABEL$1,1,0

Great approximation, but will better very easily and won't sour well on toilets!. I purchased this product after reading all the reviews and watching Claire's review video, but although it might work well on the bath tub or the sink, it does not work easily on toilets. I tried unclogging my toilet possibly 10+ different times, but no matter how accurately I did it, my toilet is still clogged. Also, after less than 20 attempts, the pump broke and won't air seal broke and won't hold more than 4 pumps. (supposed to hold up to 20-30)So as much as great of an idea this product is, it won't really work on toilets (although it does work OK on tubs/sinks) and might break easily (mine broke in two days).$LABEL$0,1,1

This picture was Oklahoma.... I gave this movie only 4 adept because it was not that belivable to me, and while a movie does not need to be.... this one i was expecting to be almost based off a true life story.Besides that though, this movie was relitivly a mild-paced movie, some parts were a little slow, and in the end there was a gimmick ending. This movie may not be the effective movie to show to younger kids, because they may get afraid of the concpet of someone knowing their whole life and trying to kill people.Robin Williams did a good job, and all the characters in this movie were very well played! There was not much of a plot, but what they did have was pretty well planed.There was no "Thrilling" special/visual effects and no "Stand-Out" music, but that's ok because this type of movie does not require eaither.This might be a movie to rent though, as it is one of those that you can see twice and be done with.~Hope this helps$LABEL$1,1,0

Cammie, Sam, and Dee think Anna is just an A-list wanna be. While Cammie's ex, and major hottie, Ben, and Anna are falling for each other. Plus there's the hot limo driver.

VERY knockout READ. This book is very hard to read. I have successfully made it 3/4 through the book, but it's because I have been forcing myself to continue reading. I do like some of the points the book makes, and think it has a wonderful message, just wish it was easier to read. Uses A LOT of big words that are not everyday words for the average person, which forces you to have to think longer on each sentence you read. Would find myself having to read the page 2-3 times in order to get the point. As said, it does have a great message, but I believe it could have been written as a better flow of words. I would only recommend this book to someone that is an avid Theological reader, not an average Christian looking to deapen their spiritual relationship with the Lord.$LABEL$0,1,1

He would so carfully craft a story and draw you into it so deep that you couldn't wait to finish it but you didn't want it to end. This book was so formulaic that you really didn't have to finish it to know what was going to happen. In his early books, every word he typed seemed important to the story. In this book, you have page after page of almost nothing but adjectives. I want my old Koontz back. This book was not worth the read.$LABEL$0,1,1

Very prissy - Especially for the Price. I got this about two weeks ago, and now I've put it to a fair test: During driving. I think the so called "Shock Protection" saved it most of the time, after all, these aren't the worst roads. But suffice to say, it never skipped. So, it works great! However the car kit that came with it only worked one time when I hit PLAY, and it only made output in the left ear. Good thing I brought batteries! The AC Adapter is included as well and is a nice touch. The headphones included are high quality. Finally, I haven't tried the cassette adapter, for I have no use for it when I could have CD quality =) Why four stars then, and not five? Well, perhaps for the poor car kit, but also for looks.

Good book, stunned layout. This book has a lot of good info and photos. only the layout is the stunned thing I've seen in a book. Most of the photos are spread across two pages and since this book is quite thick, the centers of the pictures are curved and it ruins the photos. The info and the photos in the book should get 5 stars but the layout has finished everything. They have also missed IL 2 which I believe is the most produced aircraft in history if not in the second world war. They have included aircraft models that are much insignificant but missed IL 2. Some would argue that IL 2 was a ground attack aircraft but not a fighter but almost half of this book is dedicated to bombers and other non fighting aircraft.

advantageously deserving the money. I suffered from Panic Disorder for more than 10 years. Every GP i saw told me i would never be cured and offered me medication to keep my anxiety under control. Thankfully I never accepted the drugs. When i was at the end of my tether feeling totally worthless and helpless, i ground The Linden Method. I bought it, thinking i was maybe being conned as i was at my lowest ebb. I have to say i cried when i firstly started to read the manual. And the Panic Attack Eliminator was like an epiphany. The Linden Method is honest, safe and has a real understanding of how panic can control your life. The after sales support is also superb.I am not totally cured, but i know this is mostly down to me. The Method itself is sound, and if it doesn't completely cure you, I'm sure it will at the very least make your panic disorder much more manageable.Very strongly recommended.$LABEL$1,1,0

This recap is for the 3D adaptation - frightful - Don't languish your time!.... I've proudly collected most all 3D Blurays available in the US since the beginning. I must say that ace ROBOT is the whip 3D conversion I've ever experienced. I actually sold it on ebay for $9. It looked like a pop-out book - simply unsatisfactory. FOX/SONY has boasted about their new techniquest to convert 2D Classics to 3D classics. Note to Fox/Sony: PLEASE DON"T RUIN ANY FURTHER CLASSICS IN YOUR CATALOG WITH THIS QUALITY CONVERSION. I was so Dissappointed - a Great Movie in a horrible 3D presentation.Sony/Fox should take some pointers from Pixar or James Cameron for the future 2D- 3D conversion. You thought Last Airbender 3D was bad - experience I-ROBOT and it makes the Airbender look like a classic.

If you want to learn about the ideas behind the openings then I would recommend Discovering Chess Openings by Emms. If you are want a more detailed book on all the major openings then I would get Fundamental Chess Openings. FCO is a good reference book, but for the most part, it just lists moves and doesn't try to teach you about opening theory. If you are looking for a strategy book then I suggest Modern Chess Strategy by Pachman.$LABEL$0,1,1
Norah's sputter moment. Norah Jones may not have the keyboard proficiency of Dianna Krall nor the polished vocal range of Sade but she has what the others don't have - 8 Grammys. Whether the Grammy was a one-hit-wonder glitch or a confirmation of her talents is a moot exit.What is obvious in this New Orleans operation is her artistry -- no embellishments, just chasteness and ornament. Norah exudes femininity which is sometimes intemperate to convey in a jazz scope; her voice, oftentimes soulful and melancholic, comes across intimately in Lonestar, Bessie Smith, The Painter Song and the surprise encore Tennessee Waltz. Her now familiar "Don't Know Why" and "Come Away with Me", performed live, are enough reasons for having this DVD.In the musical world where artistic integrity are often compromised, it is nice to have for more than a 'brief shining moment' a lone star like Norah Jones.$LABEL$1,1,0

A get down follow up cd.. I read in a magazine interview that Miss. Jones did not want to be seen as "Just A Jazz Singer" an on this cd she wanted to show her country music influence, which she got growing up in Dallas, Tx. On a side note she came out of the same perfoming and visual art school as fellow Dallas Texans, the great contempary jazz trumpter Roy Hargrove, and neo-soul singer Erykah Badu. Back to this cd, while I really like her voice, she is out of her league as some sort of neo-country female singer. Although the cd does have it's solid moments such as track 11 "The Prettiest Things." I give her credit for try to branch out into different sounds,but one must know what works and what does not. I hope that by her next new cd she knows the The quote of Miles Davis "Great Music, like great art is more define by what's left out, rather than what's put in."$LABEL$0,1,1

Good Salesman, big Advice. Dr. Grey, with a PhD from a university closed down by the State of California as a diploma mill, is a great salesman and story teller. Although his thesis in his new diet and exercise book is intriguing, Grey does not give any references whatsoever as to from where his theories about hormones and their role in nutrition come. Some facts in the books seem dubious, "..the brain uses 20 percent of the calories we consume."However, because the caloric intake of his nutrition system should be less than the reader would normally take, participants in the system should show a loss of weight over time. And because the theory is novel, a reader will also tend to believe everything Grey says, as believe they "feel" better.I would feel safer about his nutrition ideas if he had added an appendix of references to scientific or even to popular literature that could confirm his ideas as good science.$LABEL$0,1,1

Not that bully. First off, most of her songs are so repetitive that they get really annoying and irritating to listen to. The first 3 songs are somewhat more rock, but after that most of them just sound like mandy moore songs with a guitar.

Adults' Fairy Tale. It is a true fabrication where all is well that ends well. Mr. Reiner writes with ease about persons with distinguished achievements, wealth, and health. Even the ones who are sick are made to seem fit. There is a reason behind everything and each character possesses great human values such as compassion and understanding. Even the ogre of the tale has his good sides. Of course, the whole story is weak and full of mirth. That is Mr. Reiner's style. He knows how to make people laugh. There is a minor story within the main story. Both are equally enjoyable. Nat, the main character, suffers from serious personality disorder that he succumbs to seeing a therapist. One thing leads to another and he is on the journey of searching the truth of his origin. He finds out a lot of information and a few close relations. It is first and foremost a love story between men and women and among family members. When told in Mr. Reiner's wild humor, it becomes more pleasing.$LABEL$1,1,0

A Gift Book for the Spiritual Journey. This small format, intemperate cover gift book is a prize. In 99 pages, we read a variety of quotations from Mother Teresa. Recurring themes include nature, prayer, and love. We learn that the attention she got from the media was a burden to her, endured willingly because publicity for her work drew attention to the poor. She found speaking in public torture, saying it was easier for her to bathe a leper than to answer a journalist's questions.The content of these brief passages is complemented by Mother Teresa's gift for language, for example, "I am only God's pencil, one that he uses to sketch whatever he wants," and "love's garment has a hem that reaches into the dust, and brushes it away." Every page has a message with the power to inspire.$LABEL$1,1,0
Not unmatchable of her sound efforts. I get the impression that EP wrote this book(and set it in the past) because the Amelia Peabody series may be losing some of its appeal. After all, Amelia and Emerson are now getting old (hard to believe that Emerson can still be an ageless 'hunk' in those later books). So is EP trying to recall the 'glory days' of this series?I found the story and characters to be 'small' compared to her other books. This book was simply not up to the usual EP standard.On a more personal note. After ready all of the books in this series I am starting to grow weary of the pretentiousness, superiority and pomposity of the entire Emerson family.$LABEL$0,1,1

expire after 2 twelvemonth. I bought this unit about 2 years ago. I had to counter the initial unit because it did not work correctly (thanks to Cabellas customer service). The second unit worked well for a while (yes it was a long set-up), but we were happy with it. The rain guage contain operate pretty early on, as did the humidity/weather condition sensor. However, the 2 parts we used most, which were the temperature readings in and out and the anemometer, seemed to work very well until we hit the 2 year mark. Then the whole unit went out and no matter of new batteries, reset, or anything else will make the unit function.

"Colour the Small One" has a simple, near-acoustic rock stylus which, along with Sia's vocals, are reminiscent of Dido's "Life for Rent" and include many jazz and blues overtones. Guitar, brass instruments, synth organ, and flush the xylophone are tastefully conflate with both dissolute and boring pleximetry in amounts that are often quite complex, yet carefully avoid the "noise rock" effect.

Don't languish your time with this peerless!. Some people have said that this is an interesting and engrossing book, but I found it to be the very opposite! This book was VERY slow-moving; nearly the most sluggish book I've ever read. Details can enhance a book, or they can bring it down in readibility. This book is sate with the latter. Hal Borland has written some FANTASTIC books, but this is certainly NOT unmatched of them. evenhandedly well-written and mildly interesting, this one is not worth your time or money.$LABEL$0,1,1
Not urge. I purchased this wireless router hop to supplant my 3 years old LinkSys router. nonetheless, after roleplay with it for several hours, I decide to replication it because of the following (using firmware 2.18):1. mackintosh trickle: Can't make it for wireless only. Once it is enable, it is for both wireless and wired network. This is the nearly annoying partly. I mean, why do I deprivation to enable MAC filtering for my wired network???2. Router configuration: Very primitive comparing to my old LinkSys.3. Enable/Disable Wireless: It didn't really disable the wireless network(physically). It shoulded be called "allow/deny all" access instead. Once the wireless is "disabled", it does still broadcast the SSID.4. No way of disabling SSID broadcast for security reasons.Finally, I have to give DLink credit for making upgrade firmware so easy (Web base), which is a big improvement comparing to my old linksys router.$LABEL$0,1,1

If only I could sacrifice zero hotshot.... Yes, it's dumb, but no, it's not risible.And I love lowbrow humor. Like Dumb & Dumber...I laughed my hiney off and I'm no Carey winnow. I rented this movie fully expecting something very stupid, and very funny.Well...it's very stunned, I gotta give it that... Only problem is that it never really got very funny. It looked funny from the commercials, but the problem is that those scenes were the ONLY funny parts of the movie. If you saw any commercials or reviews, don't bother renting or (heaven forbid!) buying the movie. You already saw the good parts.I just wanted to poke both of these idiots in the eye after about a half hour. I watched the whole dang movie waiting for it to "get funny"...and it never did. No matter how much I smoked, it just didn't ever get funny. And I usually like watching idiots blunder around!Just do yourself a favor and at least rent it before you buy...this isn't a good flick to buy on the assumption it's gonna be good.$LABEL$0,1,1

Streamlight Stinger Battery. I purchased this battery on Amazon in November, 2009, from another supplier. Much like a couple of the reviews mentioned I welcome a battery "take in China". I didn't think much of it at the time. It seemed to charge in the same amount of time and have about the same battery life as the OEM that lasted me numerous years.I have now noticed I get about 10 minutes on a full charge. My old "original" battery lasted me about 10 years and got me around 1 hour of use per charge. This is less than a year old and I have been using the flashlight the same as I always have.Moral of the story, in this case saving money will not be a benefit if you use your flashlight frequently. I will not buy a "Made in China" battery for my stinger ever again.I'm not bashing "Made in China" and I don't normally write reviews, but keep my review in mind when ordering.$LABEL$0,1,1

Up or Down?. Really charge on the movie.I loved the beginning, but found myself wondering right away, "Just how is this a kid's movie?" The plot was just too grown-up. Then they started haphazardly throwing in this random stuff obviously meant to amuse young children. It was uncomfortable.Don't grow me unseasonable. The introduction was engrossing. The animation was great. Most of the characters were genuinely lovable, especially the old man and Kevin. But in the end, it just felt like an ugly patchwork - bits and pieces were extraordinary, but ultimately, everything clashed.For the record, I have no problem with talking animals or nonsense in a children's movie - I even expect them. And I truly love Pixar. But this film just didn't sit right with me. The idea was very adult-minded, and it didn't seem like Disney quite worked out what message they wanted to send to kids. Very confusing.Although I really enjoyed some parts, Up left me feeling down..$LABEL$0,1,1

nerveless Buk novelty item. Bring Me Your Love is a 1983 short story by Charles Bukowski. The story itself is above average for Buk and far superior to There's No Business, which is offered by Black Sparrow Press in this same format. The R. Crumb art is very compatible with the tale. It's the story of a man visiting his wife in a mental institution and the conversations that follow. Typical Bukowski subject matter...madhouses, women, sex, booze & not much hope at all. If your shelves are already filled with the real Buk books, I would definitely recommend adding this to your collection. Keep in mind, we are talking about a fifteen page book here! There's not much tohold, hence the great price.$LABEL$1,1,0

The other vendors products have worked as expected (thank god), but the Honeywell space heater was defective from the first. I probably should have dealt with it sooner, but with painting, plumbing, and refinishing floors and all of the chaos that comes with a fixer upper I let it go.It runs well for about 3-5 minutes and then shuts off. I susppect a defective heat turn-off. I called the service number on the bottom of the unit and was told to mail the unit for a replacement. The cost of shipping was to be paid by me.

stiff Vacation Read. The two biggest complaints about the book are the existence of stock characters and less than believable plot twists.I found the characters strong. Perhaps they were not multifaceted or three dimensional, but it wasn't like the protagonists had no negative attributes or you had no sympathy for what the chief antagonist, Nicky, must have gone through in life.I am confused by what other reviewers found unbelievable in various plot twists. Biggest plot twists are premised on the fact that organizations, legal or illegal, seek to safeguard their assets in a variety of ways, legal and illegal. Good people make poor choices. None of these are shocking.I tried and failed to read this book traveling on Amtrak with my children, but that was more because of their behavior. I then read it thoroughly in about 4 days. Good read, interesting information, challenging focus. I strongly recommend you read this all at once as there are a lot of twists and turns.$LABEL$1,1,0

knock-down stories from another creation. I first came across this leger while reading Francine Prose's "Reading Like a Writer." She provided a short excerpt from "A Distant Episode" and I was intrigued.That particular story - the first in this collection selected by Bowles - was perhaps the most arresting, but they were all interesting. Each story quickly draws you into an exotic world with characters and settings that are palpable.Perhaps I was most taken in by how different each of the stories seemed to be. From a horrifying, violent descent into obscurity and insanity to a simple collection of letters by a single author. From compact, intense stories to a meandering walk through the life of an older, single woman in a foreign place.These images have stayed with me long after I put the book down.$LABEL$1,1,0

What I convey was an awful compilation of some of the older, classic horror films.Terror in the Aisles is hosted by the Late Great Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen. They require us through over 70 horror flicks in just under 90 minutes. Some of these movies include, Halloween, Jaws, Friday the 13th, Psycho, Carrie, The Exorcist, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few. Also, there is a brief appearance by, the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock. There were also a few movies which I have not seen that look particulary interesting such as, When a Stranger Calls and Nighthawks.If your a fan of horror movies then you must see Terror in the Aisles it's well worth a look.$LABEL$1,1,0

The expert book I read on devise to have a new baby. The book focuses on the most important relationship to a baby--how the parent's relate to each other after the first child is born. The stability and love (or lack thereof) in the parental relationship creates the environment in which the child is raised. Men and women have different expectations and reactions to the birth of a child. This al-Qur'an is a long-term case study of what types of marriages grow stronger, stay the same or get weaker as a result of the birth of a child. The insights I gained helped me to modify and be aware of issues in my marriage that having children creates. I believe my marriage has grown stronger after children and part of the reason was the insight gained from this book.$LABEL$1,1,0

massively overrated. Rick Linklater brought this movie off on a shoestring budget: it follows, without a taradiddle, the various reflections of residents in the student ghetto area of UT Austin.I've always thought this movie was greatly overestimated: there are some commodity lines, but not really "dialogue." Pretty much all the characters talks the same: like Richard Linklater, presumably. It's really just a continuous, occasionally amusing monologue that simply drifts from peerless character to another.Linklater went on to do some legitimately good films, but this one, his third film, hardly deserves the massive study edition that this Criterion Collection edition is.$LABEL$0,1,1

The low attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis. Now in a new edition edited and with an introduction and annotation Jon Sweeny, The Road To Assisi: The Essential Biography of St. Francis was first published in French in 1894, as the first attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis, one of the most beloved figures of Christian history. Author Paul Sabatier struggled to answer the question: who was Francis the man? Groundbreaking research reveals the a fully human portrayal of a man who was nonetheless gentle, passionate, joyful, and who desired to live as Jesus once taught his disciples. An extraordinary work that covers Francis' weaknesses as surely as his strengths, enhanced by the annotation and sidebars that place events of Francis' life in historical context. Highly recommended for individual reading as well as biography shelves, and a must-have for library collections.$LABEL$1,1,0

Dragged down by a drilling report and poor publish. It seems that around the late 90s, Koontz was developing a rather wordy, pompous writing style. This hold, along with fictitious Memory, is bogged down by puzzling analogies, irritating metaphors, and questionable word usage.

axerophthol reply to Carlson. The book is an edited collection of essays protesting what its authors regard as the undue hegemony of liberal/progressive/PC ideology in clinical psychology. Many of the opinions expressed are reasonable, well supported by fact, and long overdue. Meanwhile, even those I find wrongheaded are largely to the left of Fox News, the WSJ editorial page, and Mussolini. The citations in Roger Carlson's reexamination are caricatures of what is actually said; for this the only remedy is to read the book and draw your own conclusions.

Polish my demo. I bought this CD on the strength of the two downloadable tracks here on amazon, and that other people bought it with purchases that I also have. It's somewhat dissapointing: the synth choices are on the clunky side, the drum tracks are unimaginative, the male vocal is weak -- the staple and bane of synth bands, it seems -- but the female vocal is arranged so seriously it is funny. Some nice melodies there, but aught groundbreaking or energetic. Only the last three tracks of disc two made me sit up.What this thing seems to need most is a good producer who can take this material to the next level. Right now it just sounds like really accomplished home-made demos.$LABEL$0,1,1

Thor - Another muffin in the Marvel Series. Thor is a movie that has to be looked at on a number of levels. The action and effects is undischarged. The movie scenes are rich in design and colors projecting an art deco version of Valhalla. The litigate scenes are loaded with drama and in some cases with elements of humour. What is unexpected is underlying theme of loss and redemption, a raw callous youth coming to understand responsibility is all about. Thor's banishment to Earth, his realization of loss, and his redemption through being to willing to sacrifice his life to preserve planet is a theme one does not expect in a live action comic book. Thor works on all levels. There may be a few problems with the script and some parts that should have gone on the cutting room floor but overall a very enjoyable flic.$LABEL$1,1,0

I was greatly looking forward to the second edition, and the correction of the many variance that were written in the get-go edition of Beauty in the B. Unfortunately, this is not the showcase.

This organ was never manufactured by Hammond Suzuki. It was made by the old Hammond Organ Company. This inaccurate information was also in the first edition of the book.

You really don't lack to read this. The marketing for this al-Qur'an is intriguing. Catchy. And not just for children. Using the negative to get one's attention works for adults as well. "Don't read this. This is bad. You're not going to enjoy it. Nothing good happens." Unfortunately, not only does nothing good happen, but all the one-star reviews I've read are accurate. This is a bad children's book. This is a destructive book, with dark themes that have no redeeming value, not even the author's inclusion of vocabulary words. It's a sign of our culture, which has become mesmerized by what's ugly and demoralizing, something much easier to strive for and achieve than that which is beautiful and inspiring.$LABEL$0,1,1
This book was absolutely awful.... This book is filled with numerous short stories, the themes of all speak to the struggle of Puerto Rican emmigrants to the US. Specifically in Harlem, New York. Although on the surface the stories may seem somewhat somber and simple, it is not until you read into the text that you come to understand the underlying statement that Soto is making. It makes one realize that the United States really does not uphold the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as it makes you think. It shows us that these rights are exclusively available to the group to which the government extends them. If you are not of white caucassien origin you simply have to fight for a chance, a chance to live, and a chance to feel the "privilege" of being successful. Read it one, two, or three times because each time you come to different realizations on what he is saying...$LABEL$1,1,0

Grizzly Spit Rotisserie. I condition the batteries before inserting into the motor. The the gauge read full charge. The motor had a strong time rotating the 2 whole chickens on the spit. After 5 minutes the rotisserie stopped turning and I had to discontinue cooking the chickens. I can't tell if you need fresh batteries but it didn't sour for me.$LABEL$0,1,1
supporter me out here, band people.. effective master. This picture has potentially set more damage to band people than the american pie quip. Anyone who is in march band will say you this is bull. seriously, I marched snare in my drumline and this is the most ridiculous and unrealistic representation you are ever likely to reckon. Most marching drummers would cast it down just by depend at it. Why? On the front, Nick Cannon is carrying nylon tipped drum-set sticks. Look at what happens in the movie; a solo-stealing, lying, freshman who can't even read music makes a college snareline, even though he constantly argues with center snare. At training; the members run marathons around the stands with their instruments( Wow, aside from broken instruments, what on earth would that accomplish??) And yes, anyone who needs to hire a rapper for their marching show has the worst band ever created. It's unbelievable people actually took this seriously.$LABEL$0,1,1

little board book. I had wanted to give this little board book as a gift but have chosen not to because it doesn't look new. The brood looks used, not exactly tattered but just not unused.

ugly. As a other Bela Karolyi protegee I have to say this is the big Bible that I have ever read!!!! Joan Ryan has NO right to write a hold about elite gymnasts when she has never been unrivalled herself. When I was w/ Karolyi it was never ANYTHING like what she says. What ya'll don't know is that Bela's smile and encouragment continue when the camera's not on him. I think that Ryan has a very sorry way of making a living!! I was an elite and I guarantee u that I and Dominique Moceanu, Kerri Strug, Kim Zmeskal, Jaycie Phelps, Shannon Miller etc... are in it 4 the fun. Bela, Mary Lee Tracy, Steve Nunno, The Rybacki's and every other coach who has an elite gymnast cares very much about there gymnasts. If they didn't they wouldn't have any elite gymnasts. Some people don't like Bela's coachig method and I respect that, so does he. But if u don't like his coaching just don't train w/ him!!$LABEL$0,1,1
It's not a heavy clock-dimensions are incorrect!. This clock was guess to be 5 go 4 x 1 inch-it's about 2 1/2" by 1" by 3/4". I bought it for my car but it's not large plenty!$LABEL$0,1,1
I feel pretty stunned buying this book.. I would give this book unmatched star but there are probably some guys out there that do not know the amazingly simplistic things these guys tell you. If you don't know to go to the dentist, not to wear sweatpants in public (see Seinfeld episode), and not let your hair grow down your neck, then buy this book. Other facts, such as good places to meet women, i.e., bookstores, coffee shops, are common knowledge. Some advice, such as first dates should be short and are best at coffee shops are intelligent but again should already be known. Bottom line, I don't have "game," and if you don't have that you aren't going to meet womeon. This book helps you in the conversation department. Other obvious directions are give up the cancer sticks and talk to all women. I guess that works. There is no magic pill guys, and this book won't help you.$LABEL$0,1,1
epic betray. this game gets drilling as you live, the history is quite politic, and whoever came up with the cease needs to be slapped. it sucked! you'll deprivation to order your PS2 through a surround when this gamy is over. bribe 'Star sea: til the finish of time' instead. it is waaaaaaaaay effective.but if you are still interest...the premise is the same as every other net fantasize back. there is a effective roast. a bad guy. a guy that turns out to be the real baddest bad guy and a chick. add in a quest, random battles, optional megaultrasuper bosses, characters that join with bad attitudes and reaaaaaaaaaalllllllllly big weapons. don't get me wrong, square enix pumps out some good RPG's, but this one just sucked.$LABEL$0,1,1
Excellent. I screw 2 Unlimited. I had no knowledge of them during the 90s, they were not on Chicago radio. Chgo radio had good dance/trance/rave on B96 until 1993 or so, then for some reason, they stopped playing. Not until 1998, a college radio station featured hot dance music, which morphed into Energy radio in 2001...then they went off the air! Arrghh!!I found 2Unlimited through Amazon, featured on the Jock Jams collections. So many things in life, I wonder, why didn't I know about this sooner??...and I was not a hermit or living in a cave.I play 2 Unlimited all the time now. Hope they reunite so we can see them again.$LABEL$1,1,0
Soft Porn. I was really looking forward to record this book but it foiled me. The plot and charaters at the begining are grueling to come. Then the reserve degenerates into basically the sexual effort of the master charater and unprobable gas fights. This al-Qur'an is genuinely adolescent and appears to be written by a teenager. I amaze about halfway through the volume and it did not appear to be fail anywhere get any better so foreswear say it. Maybe Amazon will buy it back slightly used.$LABEL$0,1,1

Would be 5 stars if it worked.. My Nomad II worked for a number of 1 hour, then the screen gave out and the interface with my PC died.However, that 1 hour was great, clear powerful sound...light as hell...easy to use. I'm station it gage for another in hopes this was a fluke, but right now i'm too mad to give it anything more than a shooting star.$LABEL$0,1,1
The matching. It was so stunned! The author could have nominate it a majuscule book. besides much detail, the story was suave, people swore. If this book was a film, it would be PG-13. Who in their ripe mind would form a clone of themselves. IN the action department I would give it a 2, Suspense ace. Overall, a silent al-Qur'an. I promise this follow-up was helpful. I wouldn't waste my money....$LABEL$0,1,1
eff IT!. I was surprised to read these reviews after I had already ordered and received my Pik Stik as I received mine very quickly. I am a big user of these items and actually have one of each length. I specifically ordered this size as its the one I use the most. I use the larger one for cleaning high places using a rag. I have severe arthritis, spinal stenosis and carpal tunnel,and use the shortest one as a dressing aid. If I can squeeze the handles, anyone can. I would highly recommend these to anyone and as I said previously, I received mine quickly and efficiently. I am new to Clares but hope to return. J. Nixon$LABEL$1,1,0
have my 15 year onetime to hallucinate. My son is fifteen years old and was taking Mucinex DM Max Strength to supporter with bronchitis as he tally track and had a track encounter do up. He is 5'11" and weighs 160 lbs. then, the doctor founder him antibiotics and he was to withdraw Mucinex DM as fountainhead as an inhaler for five days. away the thirdly Day my son's schooling forebode and inform me that he was hallucinating and unaccented. He also hadn't eaten anything that day and his blood pressure was 180/100. We immediately brought him to the emergency room to get him checked. He has not taken the Mucinex in over 48 hours now and is just starting to feel better (less high). I took him off Mucinex immediately but didn't realize that it could cause hallucinations. I never would have given it to him. So, I am glad that others reported this and I will never, ever buy that product again. I thank God because it could have turned out worse than it did.$LABEL$0,1,1
It Should Have Been intimately. good watched the pic; was a bountiful winnow of Saints I. It pains me to suppose that while it's watchable, it's ultimately cartoonish and overdone. The brothers' relationship is taken for granted, and they are go through obligatory gunplay care pieces on a plug-in. The temper between them and their Mexican sidekick is bastard and overdone, and his persona is never clean-cut. And Peter Fonda's stress fellate. He manifestly didn't take much time preparing for his role, as limited as it was. Don't get me wrong -- the movie wasn't terrible, but it could -- and should -- have been so much better. I watch the original every so often. I don't think I'll watch this one again.$LABEL$0,1,1
