overlook pin?. perhaps I'm just dolt and should have actualise this from the acronyms in the intersection description, but there is a pin that is not cable in this telegraph. This pin happens to be the signal that tells my laptop hardware info on the monitor I attach to... so when I hook this cable to my Samsung DLP HDTV that has a VGA port, my laptop can only assume its a generic VGA monitor and displays in firmness that don't conniption on my HDTV (like 1024x768.) I tried another VGA cable I had that has all the pins wired, and my laptop immediately recognizes the display as a Samsung HDTV and defaults to a 720p resolution. Since the purpose of purchasing this cable was to hook up to my HDTV, this cable is useless to me.$LABEL$0,1,1
well-grounded great but slight. Will not death.. I tried the cheaper in ear noise cancelling Sony earphones and they broke in a very short amount of time. I figured the more expensive version would be more durable. I WAS WRONG. These broke in an even shorter amount of time - 2 weeks. $50 is a lot to spend on disposable headphones. I guess Sony makes all of their products disposable; portable CD-players, stereos, etc. Sony customer service also suction. Pray you'll never have to deal with them. Better yet, just don't buy Sony and go with Shure. It is more but worth it because it will last. Buy from a company that doesn't believe in disposable products.$LABEL$0,1,1

but for serious Akkerman fans. I bought this as a CD in 2012, forgetting that I had owned it as a vinyl LP in the late 70s. If I had remembered, I would not have bought it again. I DO like the final 7 short songs of the album: some blues-rock that sounds improvised; also a jig and a couple medieval pieces that are cool but not as well developed as some similar works that appeared on Focus 3, Hamburger Concerto, and Akkerman's album Tabernakel. HOWEVER, the first cut, "Fresh Air", is a tedious, 20 minute example of one of those 1970s unsuccessful attempts to elevate rock music to a higher art form. Yes, there are some impressively-fast guitar licks which are instantly recognizable as Jan Akkerman. But, otherwise, I find the song unlistenable; beginning and end are dreary, noisy chaos in between. Quite a bipolar album!$LABEL$0,1,1
worked bang-up. until it develop.. It worked great. Until it broke. It hide into the tea kettle while I was boiling water and it stopped play. Sure... maybe it's not meant to be boiled... but considering what it's designed to do, one would retrieve it could survive 185 degree temps for fin mo (that's how tenacious it learn to fish it out)! I'd imagine if the seal around the thermometer's face was better, it'd be fine. But, it's not. The word "disposable" comes to mind regarding all these cheap thermometers.$LABEL$0,1,1

ace DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This hold has exasperate me! You know why? The generator is sympathetic to the hijackers of Flight PK 326, especially Arshad. My syndicate and I were aboard that flight and I can order you by their actions on that plane, that they do not deserve anyone's sympathy.
