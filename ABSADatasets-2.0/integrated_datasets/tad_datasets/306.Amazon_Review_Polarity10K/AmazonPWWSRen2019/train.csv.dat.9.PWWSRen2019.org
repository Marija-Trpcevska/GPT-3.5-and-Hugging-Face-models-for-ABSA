Mellow Yellow.... I don't care if the yellow 'glow' is supposed to be arty farty...it gives you a headache. Florida has it's own beautiful light, take the yellow filter off, it makes everyone look jaundiced.Script...?? There isn't one, just some filler, in-between some average stripping. Channing's bum wobbles like jello, Matt Bomer looks great, but even that doesn't redeem this movie for me. Plus is it just me or is there something not right about Matthew McConaughey ?Anyway, if you want to see Male Strippers go to Chippendale's or a gay strip joint...maybe even rent 'The Full Monty', any of those options would be a lot more fun than this !$LABEL$0,0,-100
one sided flag making it attractive from one direction and faded out looking from the other.. I was really lookin forward to replacing the orange caution flag on my power chair with my new American Flag with the gold trim. Unfortunately. I guess I must not have read the sellers description of the flag after my having seen a few others very similar if not the same as this one save for they were described as having the same appearance on both sides unlike my new one thats bright an cheer e on one side and has the appearance of having faded out on the other. My bad, I guess. Oh well. Win some. Lose some.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Simply the Best ONE. I have known this version of Messiah since my early childhood in the 'sixty's. You need to remeberthis is Scripture set to music. In making this both Handel and those you hear on the recording have affirmed my belief in both beautiful music and Our Lord Jesus Christ. You experience both the spiritual and sublime here.Mr Ormandy with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir have brought the highest Praise and Glory ever known on Earth to God in this presentation. I am not am expert in the music of this, I am a consumer who is now 51 and blessed by it every time I hear it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
I have a new favorite author after reading this book!. I first encountered this story in the pages of Cosmo--it hooked me and I went out immediately to buy and finish it. Anne Rivers Siddons writes the kind of books that you don't want to end. She creates another world--really paints a unique vision with her words. This story rings so true, it really has that feel of authenticity--almost autobiographical even. I have read most of her other books as well, but this one which I read a few years ago remains my favorite...As an aspiring writer, her writing both inspires and intimidates me it is so good!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Cheap - breaks very easily. It cooled okay when it worked but the wires were seperating from the plug and it only worked for a few days. I sent it back and Amazon who replaced it and this one only worked for two weeks. I gave my Rocketfish cooling fan when I got this one. While I went through two of these quickly, my old Rocketfish is still working like new. I would not recommend this product. It's not worth the time or expense of returning it again.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Simply the best BTAS!!. I've read through many reviews where people state that the early Batman: The Animated Series episodes were the best, and that may be true where story is concerned, but if you're an animation and story fan (not just great story or great animation, one always seemingly sacrificed), this later set of episodes were the best. Personally I always felt the animation in the early BTAS episodes were weak and "iffy" at best, even if the stories themselves glued you to your seat. However, with these later episodes nothing is sacrificed, as both the story and animation function in great synergistic fashion!I feel that vol.4 will be the best seller of the 4 available. I'm currently being proven correct in that assumption it seems, as I have found this vol.4 at only a smattering of stores, as most are sold out. In other words, get this vol.4 set now and enjoy some of the best episodes this wonderful show had to offer!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Just What I Wanted!. A beautiful collection with instrumental, melodious choral, and sweet solos on traditional hymns.

Not very good! Judge a book by it's cover!.

Absolutely the Best Bread Machine recipe book. This book is GREAT! I actually have the 2002 Hermes House version but have bought this version as gifts. I have another book plus manufacturer's books (I'm on my second breadmaker) and this book tops them every time. The proportions are different than the other books and work great! I've made breads (sun dried tomato is my favorite although I add basil, oregano, and garlic powder), rolls, pizza dough (the best ever), the small pizza's (sfincione), the focaccia, pitas - all are great and my kids request them over and over.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Awful, awful, awful...... What were the producers thinking? They abandoned all of the things that made the first Blair Witch a true classic. This abysmal piece of horse defecation features the misadventures of a group of adolescent losers, who stumble through the film cursing, fighting and giving off horrible attitudes. There is no suspense, no fright, and no reason to watch this one. If Mystery Science Theater 3000 were still on, this would surely have been spoofed by now.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Excellent value and very durable. My daughter is around 10 months old and this toy has really become one of her favorites. It is easily assembled, solidly constructed and very tough. A single catch converts it from a ride on to a step behind walker, and the spinning rattles and other accesories are fun as well as not easily removed. If you want a great aid to help unassisted walking this is it, and at a fraction of the cost of some other more complicated versions. I highly recommend (and so does my daughter!).$LABEL$1,0,-100
Stack-On's are Great... Wonderful product (Not Premium Security but does the Job) etc.. I like this product because it conveniently provides storage for all necessary valuables and hardly requires a manuals to guide to set.Though not an exceptional product to protect essential valuables it does the job and significantly easy to disguise and hid. under a surface or behind elusive spots. Over-all, I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for a simple way to storage minor valuables or possessions from family. That is, if you are trying to keep a secret. I find it still has some flaws and is susceptible to lock picking with the correct tools.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Marvelous Throughout. It's a rare album that is such a pleasure to listen to from start to finish like this one. Anyone who likes americana music in the vein of Lucinda Williams, Roseanne Cash, Allison Krause, Shelby Lynne, or Shawn Colvin should seek this album and performer out - yet she is not exactly like any one of these more well known artists. Less gritty than Lucinda, but the album does feature some tastefully dirty electric guitar. Not as folk-pop as Colvin. Sally's songs convey their Appalachian roots, but she isn't as bluegrass as Allison Krause. More Asheville than Nashville. In short, she's a singular creative voice playing with consistent quality and authenticity. Check her out!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Extreme waste of money. I'm a mom of 11 month old twin girls. My mother bought these for us to save space in our kitchen. I wish I would have read the reviews before she bought it. The reviews are 100% true. It is the most disgusting food trap I have ever owned. You cannot get the food out and they are too heavy to shake out all the time. The toys on the side are a waste too. They are not in a location that the girls even notice them and are too hard to push to get them to work. I have tossed them out. What a WASTE!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Excellent for young children. We have a three year old son we wanted a train table for, but were concerned that our 16 month old twins would continuously destroy the track.

This is a filler and does not remove swirl marks.. I had my car for less than a year and my mother backed into it with her car when backing out of her garage. I got it fixed and the body shop left swirl marks in the clearcoat. I've already taken it back twice and they even repainted it because of a paint mismatch and they still left swirl marks. It's getting exhausting dealing with them so I thought I would try this. I used as directed and even followed with the wax that was recommended in the directions and it seemed to work and I was so pleased. Then the next time I washed it the swirl marks were visible once again. I'm so irratated about it I'm considering trading it in already.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Hate Crime. This work is not a serious study of the relationship between Catholicism and Judaism.The Church is held up to ridicule by the simple method of suppressing the Church's statements of condemnation of anti-Semitism and then quoting apparently anti-Semitic statements out of context. A professional historian can only wince at the vicious caricature of Pius XII, a man who heroically saved thousands of Jewish lives but who in this book emerges as a combination of Elmer Fudd and Adolf Eichman.This book is about the rage of an excommunicated priest who, despite his cloying claims to love the Church, has decided to don a white hood and burn his own anti-Catholic crosses.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Poorly researched... seek information elsewhere.. I am always interested in theories regarding who exactly ordered the massacre (as my Grandfather John D. Lee was the only man ever held accountable.) I am not completely convinced that the order did not come from Brigham Young or someone very close to him in the foodchain. But this book is so poorly researched and written that it was hardly worth my time and certainly not worth my money. She gets even the most basic biographical information wrong - information that is readily availible in scores of other books and websites. I honestly don't know why she even bothered...$LABEL$0,0,-100
Definantly Different. This book started out ok but into the fifth chapter it got a little bit ridiculous, that's when I stopped reading it.

Do not buy this product. This piece of software doesn't function properly at all.It doesn't work with Apple Logic, contrary to what is advertised.It was written by an amateur programmer, and crashes very often - about 1 out of 2 kits that you open will quit unexpectedly.For a software drum machine to contain mostly live and acoustic drum samples doesn't make much sense since software is mostly used for electronic music. No trance, or electronic samples at all.All that for over 50 dollars makes idrum way overpriced.Also the graphics were stolen from Garageband.A program like that should be freeware, or at the very most shareware.$LABEL$0,0,-100

visually amazing, lacking everywhere else. i too waited a couple of years to see this film arrive in the USA, and wanted to love this film so very much. i've always loved Dave and Niel's work in the past, and i expected this to be no less wonderful. sadly, i left feeling empty. while the efforts and the visuals were worth a rental, the storyline took Mirrormask to the edge of what could have been a hugely successful masterpiece and dumbed it down. it is too scary and dark for young kids, too wierd for tweens, too childish for adults. with more defined dialog and a coherant plot, the film could have been a classic for all ages. this just seems like a spoiled rotten little kid dressed up for the fancy ball with no one to take them there. i for one, am greatly disapointed.$LABEL$0,0,-100
NOT a tradiional fairy tale.... The Conjurer Princess is a modern sort of fairy tale-- dark, quirky and bittersweet. All the usual cliches are avoided successfully. Lylene is not a sweet and beautiful princess; closer to a determined and basically honorable person on a quest that is not what she thinks it is. Those who appear to be enemies are not what they seem...nor those who seem to be allies.The ending, like those in all of Vivian Vande Velde's books, is not quite a happily-ever-after conclusion. Left wide open to speculation about the future...If you're looking for a realistic and biting fantasy in which nothing is ever quite as it appears, give this one a try.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Amazon get your act together ! ! ! !. Here is a discription of what I boughgt :Danner 02720 Pond Mag 9.5 950-Gallon-Per-Hour Pump with Foam PrefilterInstead of giving me a FOAM PREFILTER they gave me a cheap plastic cage in the shape of a cone to protect ther filter. Any small debris could pass throught the openings in this cheap plastic cage. I called Amazon and told them how I was cheated they did make it right and are overnighting me the proper foam filter that was advertized with the pump. On one hand I was so mad on the other hand I was happy that Amazon made it right with me. It almost seems that Amazon is slipping a bit in customer satisfaction from 2 years ago. Even the picture of the pump on the product page is misleading. The picture shows a smaller model than what you actually recieve. I am seriously concidering not shopping with amazon because of their mistakes. PS: the factory box was damaged but the packing box was in good shape, no contents were damaged.Aaron$LABEL$0,0,-100
Have they ever read Jane Austen. This movie was a complete disappointment. it left me wondering one thing, have the creator's of this film ever read or watched Persuasion.

Review - Muldoon by Pamela Duncan Edwards. Totally alsome!!! I HIGHLY recomend(an I don't hardly ever recomend anything,much less HIGHLY) this book for the youngsters. It's Hilarious!!! Easy for children to read and they will love the illustrations. I know my wee ones enjoyed this story. Muldoon had us laughing throughout the entire story,had us wondering what to expect next. That's one silly pooch. Loved It!!!!!Muldoon is a very busy little pooch,I don't see how he does it. Ever since the West family chose him over other applicants, Muldoon has provided quite well of his duties. It's a tough job taking care of the whole entire household on your own. All the work he does I think the West's should give Muldoon a raise.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A "popcorn movie" from Mexico!. Los Cuatro Juanes(1966) is an action packed adventure film starring Luis Aguilar, Antonio Aguilar, Javier Solis, and Narciso Busquets as "The Four Juanes". All four outlaws are being chased by government troops. When bandits kill the father of a lovely, innocent woman(Alma Delia Fuentes), the Cuatro Juanes "adopt" her into their gang. Keep in mind this DVD was mastered off a 2nd or 3rd generation VHS tape and the video and audio quality is not first class. At least this Laguna DVD was cheap.By Mexican standards of the 1960's, this was an all-star movie. There's a scene where Los Cuatro Juanes blow up a bridge with TNT so troops cannot chase them. This may have been referenced in Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch(1969). Los Cuatro Juanes is pure entertainment.$LABEL$1,0,-100

OK, but.... A fine - refined - version. I don't think CvD quite gets into this music like many others, though. The playing is faultless and the recording wide-ranging BUT it is not as clear and detailed as it could have been. It was like listening to music through a fog, with the high frequencies typically veiled in the usual Telarc manner. Musically, I'm not too fond of the way he does the famous first movement melody. The 5/4 and March-like Scherzo movements come of the best here. The Scherzo's tempo is grand and bold rather than lightening fast like many others, which is OK. One can wallow in the bass drum parts. The finale is missing the necessary neuroses.The filler, the Polonaise from Eugene Onegin, is a peculiar, if not inappropriate, choice. One of Tchaikovsky's heavier overtures would have been better suit - or nothing at all.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Kindle format a shame. This review is not aimed at the content of the book; rather at the utter lack of care for formatting the Kindle edition.Not only do I find hyphenated words in the middle of the page, chapters are not page dependent and may occur anywhere on the page, and now line spacing has gone to heck in a handbasket as well.That's what prompted me to write the review. I literally have a g and a d that are overlapping!That said, it's readable; but I tell you when the formatting is so bad that it effects the flow of the writing - it need re-done.Hopefully an anomaly.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Stinks. I bought this product for the conveninece of not having to open my desktop and for the mobility- being able to transfer it from desktop to laptop. Worked great for about 2 months and then it started causing my computer to reboot byself. At first this happened with my desktop- i was convinced my computer was broken- i spent $100 on repairs (I know I got ripped off here). Until I started using it with 2 laptops and the same thing started happening. I took it to another techy who told me that this is a frequent problemt with these usb deviced and that I would have to do something to my "bio" - i said screw it- and bought a built in card. I know other people who have the same problem and it could be very costly- when you are in the middle of working on a file and it reboots.

Glad I did not read this one first!. I actually listened it to, and did not like the reader at all - she did not do the accents very well, and when the character "bellowed" she croaked... anyway, if I had the hard copy I likely would not have finished it. Both characters got on my nerves, especially Gen. I have read most of the other McLeod and De Piaget novels, and found them to be most enjoyable. My favorites are "A Garden in the Rain" and "With Every Breath". All in all I do not think this is a good introduction to Lynn Kurland.

fantastic book. I love Sarah Dessen's books but this is my favorite so far. I was able to relate with the main character Macy so much and it was so true to life. Many of the things that Macy has to go through in this book were happening to me at the same time as I was reading the book.

Shoe broke after one wear. I loved the shoes and the price so much I bought two. After wearing the shoes one day I noticed that the wood at the front of the shoe had cracked all the way through to the sole. The nail that attached the rubber sole had created a crack and during the day the crack got so big that the shoes were not safe to continue wearing.Wear the shoes with caution; they can become deadly to your health and safety.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Sour Grapes for Sony. Toshiba was a major player is the development of DVD. Sony wanted it all and lost out, having to work it out with Toshiba and join their DVD parade.Now, years later, Sony wants it all again. They want control over the next generation high def DVD format, so we now have a format war.Toshiba's first HD-DVD player is great! It's up-conversion of standard DVD is the best I've seen and the actual HD-DVD image is fantastic. The best HD picture quality I've ever seen.I'm sure Blu-Ray will be great as well. It's just too bad that this format war is on. But I'll tell'ya, at half the price of the cheapest Blu-Ray player, buying HD-DVD is a no brainer.Would you want to spend $1000.00 on the Sony or Samsung Blu-ray player and get no movies, or the Toshiba HD-DVD player and get 25 HD-DVD movies for the same price?Blu-ray might have Sony's Columbia Pictures locked up but HD-DVD has Universal Picture's and Dreamworks saying they are going HD-DVD only.Yes, it's a war.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Troy-Bilt TB25BP Gas Blower. The blower worked one time. We replaced the spark plug, had new gas/oil and gas can. Called the company and was told it might be the coil? The next nightmare was finding a place to have it fixed since only one of the five places they suggested would in fact take it. It remains in the repair shop and of course if it is 'carburator' related it will not be covered under warranty, per the repair shop. I will never buy another Troy Bilt product or anything mechanical on line again. Probably will never blow leaves by the looks of the repair time!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Terrible.. I stuck with this book for 120 pages. By then our heroine had lost her brothers (gettysburg), her father (mauraders), her mother and her fiance (buried alive), been gang raped, and was hit several times by men, even her 'love interest'. This book smacks not only of violence (which civil war or any war books have to some degree) but particular violence against women. And the writer doesn't understand the womans view. After being gang raped , she falls into bed without qualms with someone else a few days later. It is so disturbing that I found myself searching for info on the author. 'Felicia Andrews' may be a man since the copywright info is in the name of charles grant. That made me feel better because at least a woman did not write so callously about another woman. Scratched this writer, whether it is a man or woman, off my buy list.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Deceiving Photo. The picture is deceiving. The face looks blue in the picture, but it is really purple. I found the watch to feel cheaply made.

Excellent portrayal of a young woman who becomes a queen. This motion picture is first-rate at every level. It gives one a glimpse of what Elizabeth's early live must have been like with a half-sister who wants to behead her through a lover who betrays her. This movie lost by a photo finish to Shakespeare in Love for the Academy Award as Best Picture of the Year. It will not disappoint history buffs and works as a drama that makes history live.

a healthy cooking MUST have!. The Scanpan is just amazing. There, I said it.I typically go through a new (10-12") non-stick frying pan in less than a year. I bought this one to test it out...I heard the Scanpan line was awesome and needed a smaller pan to cook my own personal diet foods (while the rest of my family hogged down on spaghetti bolognese and pasta dishes).It is perfect to cook a few eggs, a piece of fish, your own personal little stir fry, and whathaveyou. And here's the kicker: you don't need hardly ANY oil. I use an olive oil spray and that's good enough! And here's the OTHER kicker: the clean up ROCKS. You don't HAVE to clean up because 99.99% of your cooked food will wind up on your PLATE instead of stuck around the sides of the pan. Imagine that?!!Once my 10" and 12" pans die (I might accidentally drive over them) I'm going to invest in the next sizes up in the Scanpan Professional.$LABEL$1,0,-100
This book was a bit too redundant.. I think Jean Auel is an awesome writer. However, I think this book focused way too much on "how amazing" Ayla was in the eyes of all the other characters. I adored Ayla in "Clan of the Cave Bear," and "Valley of Horses." (I have read those two books over and over again.) In this book, Ayla seems too subdued, or not really shining through, as in her previous books. I agreed with one reviewer which stated that Ayla spent too much time explaining and retelling what all of Auel's readers had already read in her previous books. I probably will never re-read this book. I still love Jean Auel and Ayla!$LABEL$0,0,-100

DMB or Aerosmith?. One collosal blunder! When the decision to change producers was made, the DMB as we knew it.... ended. Sad but true. The melodic, witty sounds of previous DMB songs does not exist on this CD. The music "blends" into itself. The creative, jam session-like tunes that made Dave and the gang stand out among the mainsteam is forgotten. The drummer keeps time, thats it. The violinist is wayyyyy back there somewhere, Dave is having his favorite accoustic guitar tuned or waxed or something saving room in the studio for electric. Oh wait... was that a sax!! naaaaaaah... I think the "new" producer burped! Oh, but I did hear Aerosmith did a few cameos... NOPE.. that's DMB sounding just like Brittany and Aerosmith.

Look at the second and fourth review. The second review and the fourth review were obviously written by the same person. They both are written by "a music fan" one saying from moscow, the other from michigan. They also both use the word rhythm in the praising the music. On the form to write a review, they ask where you are from, giving moscow as an example. That is the clear reason why he said he was from moscow. He must have been offended that someone wrote a bad review after his good one, so he decided to write another good one. Don't trust it!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Good Information about the Truth. I read this book in high school before I joined the Army. I did not understand a lot of his points or rather did not want to understand his accusations about Jews because I come from a strong Christian family. I spent 4 years in the service and because of that I had plenty of down time to research about everything going on with America and why we are in this war still! So now I find this book on Amazon 5 years later and have always reflected certain information toward this book. I find it very informative and balanced.In my final opinion I think every one should read this and take most if not all of this book into consideration.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Going back to my 35mm camera. I bought my DX4900 less than a year ago. I was happy with it when I first bought it but the last several months I've noticed about half the pictures I take come out blurry and very, VERY grainy. I am not doing anything different from when I first bought it, so I suspect the quality just does not last or stand the test of time. Also, from the beginning, the rechargeable battery life has been pathetic. I can take about 17 pictures and then it shuts down because of low battery power~ however, if I set it in the dock it reads that the battery power level is good! I spent $400 on this camera (incl. the dock, as a package deal) and I expected it to last longer than a year. I can't count on my pictures coming out and have lost too many precious moments by using this piece of crap.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Disappointing. I really enjoyed the first book in the series, in large part because of its sense of moral ambiguity. There were no "good guys" and "bad guys", just people, most of them flawed, trying to live their lives.Then I started reading the rest of the series, and it's a hackneyed series of battles between Good and Evil, interspersed with gratuitous sex scenes. What happened?One thing that happened is that Amazon saw my five-star rating on that first book and keeps trying to get me to buy the rest of the series. Hopefully entering some lower ratings will dissuade it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Ok, but nothing like what I expected.. Overall, I'm totally disapointed.I'd like to kick myself for not checking the reviews on here before buying this product at the store for FULL price.The "handle" is useless, so I just push the food through the slicer with my hands, which sooner or later will probably end in a hospital visit.I have sliced some basic veggies without too much trouble, but not like I expect an $80 slicer to. I haven't even bothered to do anything but straight slicing b/c its obvious to me it's just going to irritate me.The "dial" that adjusts slicing size doesn't stay - I start slicing something thin, and wind up with half inch cuts by the time I'm done.I wouldn't buy this product again, and I wouldn't recommend it for the price.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Fun for the kids. I ordered this jumper online. When I received it there was no jumper inside the box only the motor. I emailed Amazon's customer service and explained what happened. They arranged for UPS to come back and pickup it up the next day. They also refunded me the shipping charges. So thought was great. I went to Toys R Us and bought the jumper. This is a great toy even though my son did not seem to interested in it. He is two years old. But his cousins who are four and five years old had a blast.I'm sure he will have to get adjusted to it.

A good book that shows how stupid McCarthyism actually was.. The Crucible is an interesting book about the Salem Witch Trials. It is very obvious from the readers point of view, what is happening and how everything could be stopped.Unfortunately, because the characters only want to save themselves, the truth becomes lies and lies become truth. Everyone has a choice of saving themselves and condemning others or standing up for the truth, condemning themselves, and stopping the cycle. Strangely, the "perfect" people of the town all lie. Arthur Miller wrote the play during The McCarthy Trials. In his book it is quite obvious how stupid the whole thing really is and the book has almost a direct parallel to the Mc Carthy trials, yet no one thought their was any problem with the trials. The book was a very interesting way to show the people what was really happening.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Rope too big. I originally had the small size because my dogs are 25 lbs. each, but their mouths could not go around and pick up the plastic jug from the bottom (which they are supposed to do so they can shake the kibble out). I returned the small one, and order the extra small, and even though the opening for kibble was smaller, the rope was not. Even when I broke up the kibble it can not get around the rope. I was going to return it, but was in the middle of a move, so now I'm stuck with it, and it never gets used. I suppose if I can somehow untie the rope, unbraid it, remove a section, rebraid it, and retie it, it may work...but as you can see that sounds like an awful lot of work, for something that should have been designed better from the start.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Vice City vs. San Andreas. To people with neither Vice City nor San Andreas: Be sure to buy VC before SA. Vice City is far more enjoyable than San Andrea due to the great characters across the whole game, the missions and the overall feel of the game. Also VC as a city is far more entertaining than the drab and boring Los Santos. I have not yet got to the other 2 cities but the fake Miami is a hundred times better than the fake LA.The characters in VC are funnier, the missions are more interesting, and the overall experience gives the game a better feel whereas the characters in SA, across the board, are boring and lame and the missions are extremely tedious and often times boring.While San Andreas allows you to do more than Vice City, I guarantee you that you will have a far better time doing less in Vice City than you will doing endless missions and Sim City rip-offs in San Andreas.Definitely choose Vice City over San Andreas if you're looking for a fun game.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Played for 5 minutes, then deleted. I'm not sure why I bought this game: I knew it would be bad. I guess I thought Harvey Smith made some great games, so maybe this was a rough gem. Nope! Just a boring, vanilla, limited-in-every-way-possible wack-a-mole shooter. The worst part is that the weapons have literally no kick or feedback, you might as well be using a laser pointer. Note to FPS designers: before you do ANYTHING ELSE be sure that it is fun and rewarding to aim and click the mouse button; if you fail at that, nothing else matters.This game fails at that most basic task, and thus it's not even worth discussing--too bad!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great deal for all the functions and pretty stylish as well... I have been wearing metal band watches for a long time, but now that I work in a hospital, I wanted something lighter and digital. So I purchased this watch with absolutely no expectation, since it was so cheap. After wearing it for about a week, I have realize that this watch is great! It is very simple to read and it has the seconds "pie" counter right in the middle. (which beats staring at a ticking seconds hand in my opinion) It is both analog and digital and it is pretty stylish for a 20 some odd dollar watch.

Please save your $$ Buy K-9 Advantix II. I wouldn't normally write a bad review for a product, however, I really believe this is not worth the money. It essentially did little to nothing to kill or prevent fleas on our pets. I can safely say that most of the fleas on our pets did not die or even leave the animal. We tried this for a three month period and it was absolutely useless.In a comparison, we switched to K-9 Advantix II and the difference was night and day!Same animals, location, weather, etc...The Frontline Plus honestly did not work. I may have well administered tap water instead of Frontline Plus.The K-9 Advantix II worked almost immediately.PLEASESave your money! DO NOT WASTE IT on this product. I can't imagine how two products (FRONTLINE - ADVANTIX)claiming to do essentially the same thing, can be so vastly different with results. If I had to rely on Frontline, I would simply not use anything.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Gets better after first two listens. I had previously said that this was derivative. Now I've gotten to the point that I'm actually used to it.Kid A was one of the best albums of all-time. This, while not as good, can still be enjoyable.It starts out with "Pact....", which is a more techno song from the album, as it isn't the best, but good first song. "Pulk/Pull Revolving Door" is great, despite the fact that the same chords are being used throughout the song. "Life In A Glass house" happens to be my favorite track, a dancy tune that has decent vocals. If you're not already interested, get The Bends, OK Computer, or Kid A. This isn't their best, but I like it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Living the So Called "Good Life" isn't so Good, after all... This story has a lot to teach all of us about what we assume wealth buys. It goes beyond what we have always been taught... "Money doesn't buy happiness" even though many of us have secretly believed..."if only I had that much money, I KNOW I could live happily ever after".....I suggest you read this funny and surprisingly insightful memoir and have your mind changed, just like mine was. I wish this former nanny all the best and would like to thank her for taking the risk to write this book. I will never look at Hollywood the same again.$LABEL$1,0,-100
a great look into US-Indian policy and relations. i first came upon this book through my brother who studies archaeology at university of arizona. his american indian studies professor used this book as the textbook for the class. i read it cover to cover and found it very intruiging and fascinating (as well as horrifying). a great start for anyone whos interested in how the land your living on went from belonging to an indian tribe to becoming yours, and what happened to the people who owned it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Sounds like one long song.... I love Tabla drumming, but to be honest, this CD is too repetitive. It all sounds like one long, never ending track. Maybe it would be good as background when you're not really paying attention. Nope, no it wouldn't, because you'd be noticing how one track blends into the other into the other into the other.

Best Matbreaker for cats or small dogs!. I've got a long - thick haired cat that always gets terrible hair mats each spring when she sheds. I've tried plenty of detangler and dematting combs, but couldn't find one that was easy to use (cats don't always stand still) and works fast. If I could have designed one myself, this would be it. It's small and fits well in your hand. The curved combs prevent jabbing the animal while they quickly and easily grab underneath the matt. Then as you pull, the inside blades safely and quickly slice the mat right out of the fur. It's fast and makes this chore SO much easier. The cat no longer minds the process.

"Impossible. . .things are happening every day!". Wow, some productions become the entertainment church of the soul, and this one is no exeption.Who can resist the story of a young non-regal born lass, destined to become an inhouse maid by her horrible wicked ancestors from her kind father's desolved marriage from his death, to eventually become royal princess! It almost becomes a tear jerker from Leslie Ann Warren's very convincing cry in "her own little corner."Actually, here, the wicked ancestors are a bit more comical in order to appear more clumsy, and ill mannered. Celeste Holm almost magnifys the extreme kind essence brought once before in "The Wizard Of Oz" Glinda, as the wonderful fairy god mother. The prince is fortunitely portrayed here, as not only handsome and dashing, but kind, considerate, and "in love."The musical score almost speaks for itself in catchy memorable tunes, and lyrics. And it ends with those very words, in my review heading!$LABEL$1,0,-100

I got Shafted!!!!. When this movie came on T.V. many years ago, I recorded it, edited out the commercials and everything. So when it finally was released on D.V.D. I jumped at the chance to have a better quality version.I even gave my V.H.S. copy to my mother. Man, was I ever disappointed, the movie is missing critical scenes. Too many to even describe in this review!! I thought because [...] that that was the problem, but after reading so many other reviews that basically are saying the same thing, I can see I wasn't the only one who got shafted.And to make things worse, my mother won't give me the V.H.S. version back!!!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Color by numbers. Genius would require more than transparent emulation and standard songwriting in my opinion.If you don't play music yourself or think that the ability to copy others or follow formulas has some value, then maybe this is for you.I am an advocate of judging how something sounds over where it fits in terms of creativity or obscurity. However, Mayer has crossed the line. Not only does he clearly seek to write songs just as he has heard and make his voice sound just as others, the voice he's chosen is that contrived dave matthewesque cacaphony.If you love coldplay and dave matthews and anything that sounds acoustic, then knock your socks off. But, if you've heard a couple Mayer songs and aren't into acoustic singer-songwriters enough to know a hack from a visionary, I would keep looking for an artist with at least the desire for creativity and unique personal expression.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Puzzles plus Quests!. I was sort of skeptical about this game. I love a good RPG and I enjoy Bejewelled, but how the heck can you tie them together in a way that makes sense and doesn't get boring? Well, it happened and the result is this game. At first, it seems just like bejewelled but as you progress you realize that your color gems that you match corolate to the manna you need to cast spells, heal, and inflict mad damage upon your opponent. Some battles are harder than others, and you can protect yourself by donning armor and having other items in your inventory to reflect, dissipate, or otherwise shield you.

A good listen provided you like the genre.. This is no intro to electronica. Nor is it a hardcore beeping frenzy without any human touches. The opening track has nice vocal touches, and the the slack-jawed commentary on "Pretty Deyenol" make for that rare track that will make you laugh while you dance. Yes, there is ample dance material here; trouble will arise in finding anyone who has heard it and would therefore be able to dance, however. In the end 'tis not a classic but rather an enjoyably small step down.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Pretty terrible. I've worked through a number of language tapes, both for German and other languages, and Breakthrough German is one of the worst I've ever encountered.For starters, the primary narrator of the tape struck me as arrogant and condescending. But worse than that is that the program does little to aid retention of what's presented. There are few opportunites to repeat what you've just heard and no follow-ups to confirm that you've said the new term correctly.Also, the program appears to have been produced in the UK so some of the translations are a bit funky (for example "tschus" is translated as "cheerio")On the positive side, some of the dialogues on the tape appear to be genuine, real-life conversations that have been (surreptitiously?) recorded.As alternatives, I'd check out Pimsleur (very expensive but excellent) or Living Language.$LABEL$0,0,-100
DO NOT BUY!. This product left a horrible white film on everything...plastic bowls, porcelain plates, silverware, glass glasses, plastic glasses-u get the point. It was so bad that I actually thought the kids put some kind of glue or a dirty paint brush with white paint on it in the dish washer. So I took all the dishes out of the dishwasher, scrubbed everything (still thinking it was the glue/paint, & yes that's how horrible this stuff was) & put the dishes back in the dishwasher for another cleaning not realizing they'd just come out with the white goopy film again, so back to hand scrubbing. Then I thought something was wrong with the dishwasher. I mentioned this to my husband & he suggested maybe it was the detergent since that was the only thing that changed. So off to the store for my old detergent and amazing, no more white film. I will never buy this stuff again. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PRODUCT. & shame on P&G because I'm sure this product was tested before they put it on the shelves!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Surprising Discovery (talks about the end). Rory Cochrane and Mary McCormack were riveting. It's a talky movie with not a lot of action and no physical contact between the leads, but I couldn't turn away. It looked like the ending was going to be predictable, especially when it got down to the last 10 or 15 minutes. I thought the end would be Cochrane breaking the seal to hold his dying wife, choosing to die himself. Or maybe the last shot would be Cochrane on his side of the seal, alone. Nope, the movie turned it around. Cochrane was contaminated and sealed in by the military and gassed. Pretty amazing movie.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good Pictures; Very Little Said. I don't think you could really call this a book--it's more like a scrapbook or photo album. I learned perhaps 2 things about AJ that I hadn't heard before. It is definitely NOT the tell-all book it has been hyped to be--which is probably a good thing. The pictures are great--obviously mostly from her personal collection, as there are pics of Backstreet Boys sleeping, and at family celebrations. Very precious and priceless picture of Brian and Nick in younger years sound asleep on a couch. There is one picture of AJ in the bathtub--not too revealing--thank goodness.

Ichabod Crane Revisited. SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999), starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, and Jeffrey Jones, combines horror, suspense, and comedy brilliantly. This is a loosely adapted version of Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." Depp plays a bumbling constable who relies upon the latest scientific methods to figure out who is responsible for a series of beheadings in New York's Hudson valley. Directed by Tim Burton, the film looks terrific with exquisite sets and evocative cinematography. If Burton takes liberties with the Irving classic, he succeeds in creating a superior black comedy with his distinctive trademark. And look for a surprise cameo in the role of the Headless Horseman.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good racquet. Compared to some of the other racquets I've used, the soft layer is thinner on this racquet, yet the blade is still plenty sticky. As a result, you don't get quite the spin with this as you do on other racquets. However, it will spin plenty. And what is lost in spin is made up for in speed. I've liked it and so have other players who have played a game or two with it.The only fault I find with it, is that I wonder of the durability. There are some cracks on the edge from hitting the table and I wish the manufacturer wouldn't make the thingermajigger (clear lucite) in the handle.

NOT THE CATWOMAN WE KNOW. First off 1)Catwoman in the comics was white not black like others have written.2)In the Adam west Burt ward Batman series she was white Julie Newmar- black Eartha Kitt- and the 1966 movie white- Lee meriwether.3) Halle berry is half black half white. But that is not why I gave it 2 stars I would not care if she was all black or latin or ect.... I gave it 2 stars because you can not change a comic characters orgin this much and still think people will come and see it. Granted Catwoman has changed over the years but somethings have always stayed the same She is a catburgler with no super powers.

More than Just another Great Nancy Drew Book. There is more here than just a good story for children when reading these books. I have an inquisitive 7-year old who has loved reading a few of the Nancy Drew books. (It was also an enjoyable walk down memory lane with one of my favorite childhood book series. It's a good mystery story and one of my favorites of the series). This book introduced the Amish people to my daughter and made for good discussions after we read a few chapters every night. The series also brings to light how things were "back then". Telephones with cords, big convertible cars, and a unique vocabulary. I love that we can download the book for immediate reading. My daughter and I pick out the books together and dive right in. The ebook is exactly how the real book is with the illustrations included.

However, after hearing this sub-par effort from the Styx makes me wish they would have forgone the effort and stuck to their day jobs.With pointless lyrics and musical arrangements that put you to sleep it is safe to say that the magic that this band once had has gone the way of the dodo.This is a perfect example that sometimes living in the past is not such a bad thing.

Mr. Freeze in the animated series is so wonderfully tragic, and voiced with an incredibly haunting performance by Michael Ansara.At the end, when Freeze has lost everything, but sees on the news that all that he did and sacrificed was not in vain, the music crescendos and you realize that he can rest in peace, even if he never sees his wife again.

South Africa - general overview. The geography of South Africa is the main focus of this title. Within this subject too many topics are touched on for a 32 page book that is nearly 50% pictures. Each topic, including weather, plants, animals, industry, people, etc., is given a very quick overview but none are given much depth. A glossary and index are incuded. A pronounciation guide for non-English words would have been helpful. For someone interested in general information about this part of the world this is an OK choice. For someone looking for research material - keep looking.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Wait until the end..... Yeah, normally, when you say that its followed with a "....you wont believe what happens" Not the case, what I liked about the end, was the excellent rock playing as the credits rolled, AND the fact that the movie was done. I absolutely hated this movie. I felt like it had a cast filled with supporting actors, no heavy hitters anchoring it down. Now, this movie is compared with ID4, Alien, War of the Worlds, whatever...NO WAY... ID4 has real heart, characters you care about, they have an affect on the outcome. Alien is cinematic classic, this doesnt even come close to touching Alien...so forget that comparison! Lastly, War of the Worlds, brilliant, beautiful, scary and like nothing I'd seen, this movie doesnt touch IT either. Skyline largely follows in the footsteps are larger more successful sci fi movies, and gives you nothing new. Do yourself a favor, dont substitute the originals. You'll be happier watching the ones that came first.$LABEL$0,0,-100
great acting, great story. This is an autobiographical story about James M. Barrie andhow he came to write the play and novel "Peter Pan".It is also about death and orphans: the English, as Oliver Twist by Dickens points out, had trouble dealing with orphans.Barrie had a warm open heart and found a fantasy world for childrenthat appears to be timeless and universal.There is always a place in the heart of children for pirates, Indians and fairies.There is a real contrast in the emotional approach to death taken here and that in another recent movie:The Bucket ListI think that both have good acting by great actors,but one seems to be about the "me first" approach to lifeand this one is about living with death for both the livingands the survivors. I think that both are "sentimental",but this approach seems better.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Plenty of Ice But No Zebra. Maclean lost his battle with alcoholism later in life, and it adversely affected his output. His novels became shorter and their characterization flatter, and in Athabasca, he presents one character's alcoholism in virtually a positive light. The plot of this story is forgettable too and there's only about ten pages near the end where 'master of suspense' can be applied to the writing. A sad decline for someone who was the Tom Clancy of his day and is virtually forgotten barely fifteen years after his death. As for this book, read Ice Station Zebra if you want to play in the snow!$LABEL$0,0,-100
The Best Bond movie in the universe. Out of all Bond movie's, this one is my favorite. Except for the fact that Kissy, the bond girl is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. It is so dumb why they cut the other one off. Well anyways, a space capsule was captured and hijacked. The Americans think the Soviets did it. Next, another capsule is captured and believe that the Americans did this to retaliate. The tension between the two could create another war. James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate. There, he finds the evil leader of SPECTRE has done this so when the 2 most military countrys destroy eachother. When that has happened, Blofeld will take opporitunity to seize the world. There was a lot of action in this movie. Like.1. The Space capsule hijack2. The building fight.3. The car chase and helicopter4. Little Nelie chase/fight5. The dock gunfight6. The final finale, the crater battle.$LABEL$1,0,-100
sweet deal. If you want a reliable player to jog with, runs on regular batteries, has no hard drive, uses musicmatch to make play lists and is easy to use, then look no more. I've used this one about 5x/week for over a year and it works great. I get about 15 hours per AAA battery and have had no problems with this one. If you like the idea of not having to worry about hard drive failure and battery issues with the iPod, this is a sweet deal. One suggestion, pick up some better earphones to maximize the sound quality of the player.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not so much. This worked on my dachshund about 3 times and then she decided the noise wasn't quite annoying enough to stop her from barking. Another problem was that if I tossed my keys on the table it was sitting on or my children squealed while playing, it set it off too. So we had to be quiet around the thing. I continued to change the batteries in hope that it would eventually work on her and, in about a month, I had gone through 3 battery changes. If I had continued to use it, I would have been buying batteries out the wazoo. All in all, it was a good idea but didn't work at all for my dog.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A Jewel Among the Rocks. My wife and I are voracious readers and often settle for books that are OK, but not noteworthy. Every so often a jewel pops out of nowhere and The Wild Trees is just such a book.We were early readers of The Life of Pi, and feel this book is just such a read. Editorially, they are miles apart, but both books surprise you by just being wonderful and refrshing.Within 30 pages of the start, you will be breathless, and then the character development begins. There is the poor son of a billionaire, a wonderful love story and of course the trees. The wonderful magnificent trees. And, it's all true.I just bought 12 copies to send to my reading friends and just felt it would be a good thing to let others know.Enjoy.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Marginal. This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Will only be helpful for a few.. The book was NOT what I was expecting based on prior reviews. This is NOT a guide to life organizing and prioritizing but rather the author's idea of handling office incoming mail, a filing reminder system for phone calls to be made and work to be done, keeping things one needs to share with another individual in a central location, and scheduling and consolidating that sharing. For those who don't need a computer to do their job, have a memory like a sieve, or are super disorganized and don't know where to begin to start, this might be helpful, otherwise, save your money. His ideas are only practical in a low volume paperwork environment and with those who have non-technical professions. Some kind of portable, daily planner or calendar or a computer syncing PDA is much more practical.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Rocks........As all Metallica does. when I first found out that Metallica was going to perform with an orchestra I was a little hesitant. Who would have thought Metallica would ever enter the same building as an orchestra, much less perform with one! When I first played it I was blown away with how much the other instruments accually "filled" Metallica's sound giving a new edge and fullness. Where some of the Metallica songs started to get bland or the same, the orchestra just creates such a particular sound that it sounds sooooo much better. It has all of the greats from some of the older stuff as well as some new songs. The only drawback I did notice was on the back of the cd. It lists the songs with only part of their name, this was a little misleading when purchasing from a store. Other than that, this cd is a must-have for anyone that has ever heard any Metallica. Even if you havent, this cd is for anyone with a need for metal.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good general guide on entering the industry. I've been working in the field of game audio on the content side for about 5 years. I got this book as I was starting out and I found it a quick, easy read that offered alot of helpful insight and pretty much everything Marks said has held true in my experience. There are people complaining here that this book doesn't offer deep technical information or insight on how to provide content or help with audio programming and that's true. Maybe the title could have been clearer - it's more an idea of what game audio is about and what it's like to work in that field. But if that's what you're looking for, it's a quite worth reading and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know how to break into the industry on the audio side.$LABEL$1,0,-100
This a must for every preacher to read.. This book captivates you. Spureon stood out as a preacher and pastor far above most who ever pastored. Dr.Dummand has given a vivid description of the many faceted sides of the great preacher. When I finished the book I felt like it should be studied rather than just read. You will love the many tidbits of fascinating information about the man and his ministry. Mr. Spurgeon was involved in controversary quite often. The author tells how and why. Spurgeon took a strong stand on the fundamentals of the faith when many others were not as open. There are many paralells to prominent pastors of today. It will especially encourage and strengethen younger pastors. As I read the book two thing struck me. How I wish I had read this 50 years ago. Then how we need more his tribe today. Every Christian would be blessed and profited by this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Stories are too short, not worth the money. I just bought the single DVD version and was psyched to see a dark Batman animated DVD coming out. Being a big fan, I had to get it. Bottomline, its not worth the money. Rent it first. The first story is horrible. The animation is off; Batman looks different in every story as does Bruce Wayne. Each story is only 12 minutes long so there's not enough to satisfy you. They'd be better off having fewer stories and making them longer. They probably just released this for marketing since the movie comes out next week. Too bad they didn't give us anything quality and just fluff to "satisfy" until the movie comes out.

high on shock but don't expect to take anything away.... the book is definitely a page turner, but don't look for anything to really touch you with the characters that surrounded his life, or in his complete lack of any reflection on the events and people that shaped his childhood. unlike say, a Sedaris story - there doesn't seem to be much humanity in this memoir.

A work of historic importance.. Der Graf von Gleichen will never be remembered as an opera "gem", however the Cincinnati-College Conservatory of Music's beautifully sung recording of this work is a must for any opera lover's library. The opera was composed during the last days of Schubert's short life and was not finished before his death. Therfore, Der Graf had never been staged let alone recorded by any arts organization of significance. Enter CCM. The singers and orchestra bring to life a work that history has set aside. Schubert's compositional strengths are evident in his hundreds of song treatments, and the arias in this opera reflect those strengths. For instance, the role of Suleika, gorgeously sung by the warm yet innocent soprano of Gwendolyn Coleman, is highlighted by arias resembling the Schubertlieder for which she is named. Ms. Coleman, by the way, is just one of numerous talented singers on this recording who are gracing the concert halls of the world. To hear them, buy this CD!$LABEL$1,0,-100
I really wanted to love this album. After the lackluster 14 Shades of Grey, I really hoped that Staind's new album could blow me away like they did the first time I heard them in my local music store. Unfortuantly, I realize that the band I love doesn't exist anymore. At least I still have Tormented, Dysfunction and the memories of the times I've seen them live. Now, this isn't an awful album but there's nothing that can separate them from the rest of the sludge you hear on the radio. If you want to hear music that really rocks, do yourself a favor and pick up a Local H album.$LABEL$0,0,-100

An unfortunate misstep.. A show that was to define an entire new genre in its first season goes out on in the exact fashion it sought to lampoon, punctuated by an ending that invalidates the premise that was at the very heart of the show. This transparent attempt to generate revenue from an extended treatment of it's "shocking" ending is neither surprising nor warranted. Best to turn the spigot off here and redirect those hard earned funds toward something that kept its integrity and stayed true to its heart, such as Shout Factory's "My So Called Life" or the pre-Star Trek J.J.

The least exciting of the four solo albums!. Gene Simmons seem to believe his solo album was the best, as well as the most liked. I would say that Simmons recorded the least exciting album of the four Kiss members. The opening "Radioactive" is the album's highlight. The Beatles sounding "See you tonight" and the quite rocking "Burning up with fever" are better than the average, but when it comes to the closing "When you wish upon a star", I certainly wish that Simmons would shut up - it's plain awful. The overall impression is that it's rather lame and the material is in fact quite weak more than occasionally. Simmons sure have a talent for business, but he surely think too much of his musical skills.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Research?. I downloaded this book to read on holiday in Greece. After several chapters I became rather disenchanted and indeed rather cross. The author chose Ashburton, England as her 'remote' village. I lived there in 1969 and have been back there recently so was pleased to discover the story using the village as a setting. However it lost its credibility when she describes a busload of 50 Japanese tourists stepping out. That will never happen in sleepy Ashburton, we don't have sidewalks, and the streets are not arranged in 'blocks'. Police have not been referred to as 'bobbies' since the 1950's and the final straw came when Douglass ordered scones and describes slathering the scone in clotted cream with no mention of jam - sacrilege! It may seem petty but it would be like me choosing a remote town in America and describing pavements instead of sidewalks etc. Write about what you know or do the research. It may have been a good story but I will never know.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A brilliant idea. So many of reviewers are saying this toy is inappopriate and exposing girls to things they shouldn't know yet. What?! This isn't "Kama Sutra Barbie" we're dealing with. If you're afraid a pregnant doll will scar your kids psychologically, what happens if a a friend's mother expects a baby or they see pregnant animals? One reviewer said these issues are too mature for 6 - 11 year olds. I was between those ages when I started my period, I knew what pregancy was (my mum devilvered my little sdister when I wasn't even two) - too mature, I think not.I had a similar pregnant doll when I was a small girl (I'm 15 now), but unfortunately I cannot remember the manufacturer or the name of the doll. What I do remember is that it was my absoloute favourite doll. When I was very young I had trouble imagining the concept of a baby in my mother's belly and it helped enormously.

No aerobics, and QUIET PLEASE!!. I bought this tape thinking that I would get an intense abdominal toning session, and instead, there is long stretch of aerobics at the beginning. I am not a big fan of aerobics in the first place, due to the chirping and ranting of most instructors and the idiotic and pointless flailing that it usually entails. Okay, fine. I don't do aerobics, and limit my cardio workout to sensible things like walking or commuting by bike or swimming. This leads me to the second complaint I have about the video, and that is the leader's incessant chatter throughout. Why can't they just COUNT! I find myself actually yelling at them to SHUT UP!! Which, actually works my abs a little harder, so there might be a reason for this annoying banter after all. At one point, the third instructor actually changes the exercise in mid-execution. I thought this was very sloppy. But, I must say, the workout itself is satisfying and produces results, if you can stand it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Loved It![.]. I read this book AFTER visiting Celebration, Florida. I was interested in more background info and details. We walked down the Main St of town and thought "this is nice" but not very practical. Practical is shopping in [local store] and buying groceries in[local store]. The days of the corner grocer and little hardware store on Main St are long gone so I was curious about the opinions of the author and his neighbors. This is a great story - it seems to be unbiased and does provide good background info on the town without making it boring. The author nicely weaves little stories about the town or tales of the neighbors into this "documentary" to keep the story moving. I know this book is not for everybody but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It's also a great commentary on planned communities in general although I'm not sure that was what the authors intended.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Formative Look at Hemingway. Biographers have tough assignments when writing books about their subjects: how to fill a reasonable number of pages with the entire life of an individual? Even someone who's not famous or historically significant would likely have enough material about their life to fill a book. Michael Reynolds as a biographer gives in, and instead concentrates on only a sliver of Hemingway's life. This decision made for good reading and one should end up understanding that it was Hemingway's earlier years, as is the case for most of us, which ended up shaping his life and death. The book also provides an interesting look at prewar American society, in particular, the growing and changing middle class. This supporting content often serves as a break from the sometimes cumbersome biographical text.$LABEL$0,0,-100

My first Calphalon Commercial cookware. This is my very first piece of Calphalon cookware. I have been cooking for well over 50 years, and it is far superior to any other item of cookware I have ever used. You can use very low heat, food does not stick to the bottom of the pot, and it requires very little stirring or watching. My single complaint is that it is quite heavy, and lifting it from the stove while it is filled requires a bit of strength. Having a second "helper" handle on the opposite side of the pan would be a good thing for older persons, like me, so we could use both hands.I really wish I had cookware like this at least 20 years ago!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Overpriced and a bit quirky. Found this wristband pin extractor/installer to function with a few quirks It seems to jam when used to pull pins and the installation of pins is a bit tricky, but functions. The spring loaded height adjustment was useless and only made the job more intricate and complicated. Construction is adequite and it comes with extra pin die extraction bits. Too bad it doesn't include other sizes or a hold-down machanism for the wristband during use. Over priced.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A wonderful debut.. This is truly a terrific first effort by this brilliant band. All of their eclectic glory is revealed from the start. Where their sound would mature over subsequent albums all of the ingredients that made them such a unique band are present. Brilliant musicianship, dynamic compositions, stellar vocals and harmonies and strong production are all evident. Classical, jazz, English folk, blues and rock all inform their sound. One of the finest bands in British progressive music. Highly recommended...Simon$LABEL$1,0,-100

Annoying.... This book started out annoying and ended annoying. I understand their whole image that they're trying to portray (or at least I think I do), and that's fine, but there is just way too much cussing in this book. I really couldn't stand it.That being said, I knew most of the information in this book already, but some of it was informative for me. I liked that. I like being informed without all the derogatory language though.As you can tell, the language really bothered me. Blah...The other thing that bothered me, and I'm not sure if it was a joke or not, is they go on and on about how bad it is to drink soda, how bad it is to eat junk food, artificial sweeteners are horrible, blah, blah, blah. Everyone knows that already. Duh. But then somewhere toward the end, they say something like, "Don't blame us if you see us doing beer bongs. We're only human. It's all about balance." Huh? Okay...I could go on and on, but bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not great art, but great nonetheless. I enjoy all kinds of art. Highbrow this ain't but the extreme ludicrous-ness of the circumstances that befall these characters is so over-the-top, and the characters so likable and engaging with all their flaws, and the sheer joy of the ensemble playing, led masterfully by the smooth and daring Bradley Cooper, made this a must-have for my collection. I laughed out loud watching it alone in my room and plan to watch it over again and again over time when I need a lift or a two-hour vacation. Zack G. Practically steals the show with the character's off-the-wall thought processes but everyone shines, except for poor Justin Bartha who doesn't have much to do, a function of the plot.

Poorly researched. While entertaining at times, this book is obviously not done by a serious historian. Most of her material is taken from secondary sources.

A Brilliant Piece of Work. Okay, as a non spiritual person, rather i am just a total movie nut, i must say that this film was beautifully done. Regardless of your faith, or how you choose to express it, the movie blends impressive scenery with heart-wrenchingly superb acting. Jeremy Sisto as Jesus after his his former roles, was quite a thrill to experience. I found myself watching him throughout the movie and saying to myself "that would be the face of Jesus." The simple kindness and joy in his expressions, the truth so eloquently expressed. The additional cast leading a truly enjoyable landscape upon which this film was carried, left me wanting so much more, i ran out and bought the remaining bible movies made by TriMark. So, whether you are a religous person looking for a new face to add to your ideas of the bible, or just a movie-holic like myself, i truly believe this movie is worth watching.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Take one listen to the Crown Jewels' sophomore album and you'll be hooked.The brothers Conte, singer/guitarist Steve and bassist John, know how to deliver a great album.

However, their new Linoleum CD is well worth the wait!The standout track is "Last Confession," with a rockin' sound and catchy hooks. You'll dig the slow grooves of "Strawberryvelvetfiftycentshoes."

critical distance. I've read most of the reviews here. They are little over done. But, this is a fine album. Lisa's band is tight and competent. The production and mixing of the CD are excellent. Lisa's voice, of course, is the highlight. Her voice is sublime and can send chills down my spine; vigorous, yet vulnerable. I was stuck on this album for quite a while and still enjoy listening to it from time to time. Her lyrics are one of the weaker points, though. It's not that they're bad, just not what they might be, sometimes confusing and, worst of all, sometimes trite and simplistic. Her sentiments are heartfelt, but her ability to capture them with words can still use some work. In any case, this album is well worth it. I was quite disappointed with her second album. She is a cutie, though, and that doesn't hurt.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Missy is dinkie die true blue. This CD is just awesome..her lyrics are fantastic and her singing voice has a sarcastic edge to it that makes it so Aussie I can't even explain it.I can't believe all this babble about her accent being fake. She is from Melbourne, a city founded primarily by free Settlers, as opposed to Irish Convicts in Sydney and Hobart. The free settlers were often of Scottish (as well as a Irish and a few Scouses) decent which makes the Melbourne accent slightly different to Sydney, its more nasal, like a Kiwi accent is.. So for all you babbling on about how a freakin Aussies sounds (I doubt many of you seppos (Americans) know the word is pronounced Ozzie not Ussie, like Ozzie Osbourne and or how to actually pronounce Melbourne) all the Aussies are saying she is dinkie die true blue mate (and yeah thats means really Australian)..so why not listen to us.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Awful. Unlistenable. Emaciated, pale and emotionless.. I've also been a fan of Stan Rogers for at least 20 years. I had high hopes for a fresh interpretation of some of his best works. This isn't it.All the vocalists combined can't match Stan's own range. The opening bar of the Mary Ellen Carter (1st song) gave me high hopes for the rest of the CD, but I was BITTERLY disappointed.The idea of a mediocre tenor singing Northwest Passage would be laughable. But that's what they did here. They absolutely butchered his music.This entire album completely lacked the emotion and passion that Stan brought to his music. It was a cheap, hollow imitation that wouldn't have stood on it's own merits in the absence of Stan, but knowing (and loving) his music made it even worse.It was the equivalent of expecting the finest Filet Mignon and getting a cold, uncooked hot dog instead.

Treats its subject matter with psychoanalytical expertise and in-depth examination. Divine Subjection: The Rhetoric Of Sacramental Devotion In Early Modern England by Gary Kuchar (Assistant Professor of English, University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) is a blend of theoretical analysis and close readings in historical context in order to better understand the connection between devotional literature and early modern English culture. Chapters discuss the "gendering" of god in the poetry of Richard Crashaw, representation and embodiment in John Donne's "Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions", representation of the recusant soul in the works of Robert Southwell, and concepts of body, word, and self as written by Thomas Traherne.

Initially I was very happy about the Bon-Aire BA121 because it inflates tires much faster than the old Bon-Aire AC150 I previously owned(and it still runs). The problem with the BA121 is that it failed after 3 years of relatively light use. I inflate 2 sets of 4 tires 4 times a year. That comes out to 32 inflations a year.

One of the best films of the '70s--no kidding.. I can't tell you what an original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, nothing else like it in the world and completely successful in its dogged pursuit of capturing something intensely disturbing (and yet completely satisfying and jubilant--go figure). The deeply weird all-male family is quintessential Americana dementia--the goony birthmarked hitchhiker, bulky Leatherface in his black tie, the frustrated father ("Look what your brother did to the door!"), and of course, the blood-hungry nearly dead Grandpa. Will you think I'm mentally balanced if I say that they evoke pity and sympathy as well as horror? They do! There is something undeniably bittersweet about them. The thwarted Leatherface swinging his chainsaw impotently through the air at sunrise on the highway at the end of the movie is one of the classic images of cinema. You must brave this movie. Any reluctance on your part will be redeemed.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A fun romp of a book.... This is one of those books you gulp down fast, like a cold beer after cutting the grass! A lite beer, frothy and not too filling, but definitely hits the spot on a hot afternoon. I'm a sucker for first person narrative, and the heroine is spunky and fresh.

Misleading and Not Helpful. I recommend against buying this book. I read only about a third of it and found two errors on fundamental points. On p. 67, there is a glaring misstatement about the use of Wizards that suggests that the authors never even tried the feature they are "explaining." And on page 98 there is a section on "Nudging" shapes where in half a page of text the authors do not reveal the one thing that one must do in order to "nudge" a shape -- namely, hold down the Shift key while using the up and down arrow keys. It appears that nobody bothered to proofread this book after it was written.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Human Disorder - Ugly Modern Aggression. Human Disorder should stand high in anyone's rankings of underground metal bands. This was one of the first "Hardcore" or "Hard Rock" CD's I ever bought because I was so impressed with the bands live performance, and their lyrical content. I continue to listen to this CD four or five years after I bought it, and I enjoy it each time.When I first met the band and saw them perform, they quickly sold out of the CD's they had in stock, and it took awhile to track down a store that would order it for me. Now, thanks to internet stores like Amazon, everyone can enjoy some of the best underground music without the hassle of tracking down a retailer.If you're into "hardcore," "metal," or "hard rock," check this out, you won't be dissappointed.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Thanks for Ruining The "Batman" Series! I Appreciate it!. What can I say. This movie is HORRIBLE. It completley loses the darkness, the danger, and the creepiness that were found in the first two movies. Val Kilmer just wasn't a good enough Batman. Gotham is now a disco inferno other than a dark and pest-infested city where true evil lurks. This failed attempt to build on to the series is a joke. Plain and simple.However, I DID like Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones.

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER !. My complaint isn't with the show itself. It's with Warner Home Video. I purchased this DVD from Amazon. It arrived shortly thereafter. However, when I opened it, it had two disc ones, and NO disc two. I called the customer service number on the box and explained the situation. They were very polite and said they were a "fulfillment" company but would forward the problem to Warner Home Video.To make a long story short, I have called a total of five times since early December, and been totally ignored. ALL I WANT IS THE RIGHT DISC. Perhaps Warner Home Video is so big it can ignore customers with impunity, but as a lifelong Superman geek, I'm terribly disappointed.WARNER HOME VIDEO, DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS?$LABEL$0,0,-100
Another bold ripoff of TECH Method. Without a single acknowledgement of TECH Method Tomczyk boldly goes where others have gone before.What should you write about a book basically plagiarizing other's works? The sections on superheat, subcooling, are obviously lifted from TECH Method. Subcooling and superheat at the compressor was never discussed in this industry until Lloyd wrote TECH Method and the people who don't give him credit are reprehensible.The other parts of the book aren't noteworthy as the information is available elsewhere. The five part Copeland manuals come to mind flipping through this book.Not a troubleshooting book as much as an instruction book. Troubleshooting is is all ways better in TECH Method where it's broken down by system. And gives specifics as to settings for each system.While this is better than no book.

The Brutality and Horror of War. This book offers us a glimpse of the brutality of the Air War over Europe from the American perspective. Numerous photos of doomed aircraft with wings sheared off, gas tanks exploding, gaping holes caused by flak that are both spectacular and horrific. One cannot help but to wonder what these men were thinking in their last moments. Overall this is a good book; I think, though, that there aren't enough pictures (some I've seen quite often) to justify the cost, and the text was somewhat sparse and did not offer much in the way of background information.$LABEL$1,0,-100
RUDE & AGGRESSIVE. The number of times "Shut Up" appears in these stories is shocking!! We have never seen the series but we have a cute Scholastic Thomas book and when our son received a Thomas Train Set I picked up a couple more books from the library. My husband and I were VERY disapointed with the language and the aggressive nature of all the characters (trains & people). Trains hitting each other and saying "there's more coming should you misbehave." Threatening to send trains away for being "clumsy." Of course our son loves the books because he loves trains but we don't want him learning anything these books have to teach.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Laughter for young and old. My dad introduced me to Pogo, and at first I found it hard to read. The phonetics and gramatical "modifications" that Kelly used to get across the Southern accents of the characters were strange to a five year old yankee. Later I realized Kelly isn't lampooning Southern accents, he's actually paying homage to them in a humorous way.This recording has two levels also. You can listen to it as a collection of nonsensical lyrics set to some nicely composed musical backdrops, or you can appreciate all the archaic words and double meanings in the songs. The more familiar you are with old literature, the more likely you are to know words like "quoits" and "swain" and "twixt".Young listeners will love this recording for the happy driving melodies with the funny words. Older ones will appreciate the double meanings and clever use of archaic language on top of the inherently ridiculous lyrics.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Cute story. After living a very sheltered life Lesley Caldwell could not believe when the fine gentlemen Quincy stops and talks to her. She could not control her blushes and giggles. Her only source of relationships with men are from her romance novels.Quincy could have any woman that he wants and knows that there are many who want him also. What he can't believe is that he is so attracted to Lesley because she is not like some of the women he has dated in the past.There relationship grows but not without some drama. There fellow co-worker Cheryl is a trip. Some of the things she does and says are just unbelievable.This is an easy one day read. I was shocked that Cheryl wrote such a short book compared to her previous releases. You will love this book there is laughter, sadness and the most important issue suspense.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great Book. As all the other reviews, note this book is not much of a departure from Parker's Spenser series. That said, it is a fun read. Sunny is a fun new character. It is clear Sunny could easily be a Helen Hunt.The story is much like earlier Spenser books we have all loved-whether that is a good or bad thing. Parker has included the good and the bad from his earlier efforts. We see the effortless way he puts characters together with only a few words. And the way the characters interact-much like Spenser with Hawk and Susan. Sunny has her sidekick friends Spike and the lover with who she has the issues involved in all long running relationships. Nothing new here. Parker also uses his broad brush of few words with the usual character stereotypes the reader will recognize from the Spenser books.All these things aside, we are glad to get a new Robert B. Parker book. He still has what it takes.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Only One Lesson learned.... Never buy a movie without seeing it first. I bought this movie after seing the trailers and constant requests from my daughter. I finally gave up. Silly me... I wasted my money. The movie introduces you into this wonderful world, raising your expectations, and then they drop this stupid plot, with absolutely no purpose.

Customer Service is terrible at Panasonic and the product is unreliable!!!. Had to change the drum about after 2 years of moderate use. I changed the drum (almost $100) in October 2006 due to streaking. Late February 2007, only after 4 months of use, it started streaking again! Contacted the CS at Panasonic and it was a complete waste of time; left message with the supervisor, never returned my calls. The Panasonic customer service policy is frustrate you and hope you will go away! Well, I won't go away. The freaking defective drum costs more than half of the machine!I will write to someone higher up and let the person know just exactly how I was treated by their CS.

Everyone in the theater wants to yell, "DON'T GO IN THERE!!!" But the idiot on screen still does and all kinds of bad things happen.

Classicly lovely and great for baby's vision. Not only is this a simple, timeless, unisex looking mobile, but it is also great for the development of a baby's vision. Whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. Keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. The panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. The primary colors of Blue Jean Teddy then become noticed. The green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. My baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. The only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. I would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as I and my baby wanted. But the reasonable price of this mobile AS WELL as the cute look of it made it a great buy. Educational baby products don't have to look weird!$LABEL$1,0,-100

They missed the point. In the true Fifties Hollywood spirit, this film seems to miss the point of the original book entirely. The strongest theme throughout the book was how lust for power can corrupt anyone - even the closest of your friends.However, the Hollywood dream weavers wanted to play it easy for the audience, and turned it into an inane sanctimonial hallelujah - and poorly even as that.

"In Time" is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen!. "In Time" is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen! Save yourself the t-he "TIME" and never watch this terribly written story!Oh and if for whatever reason you decide not to heed my warning, and a 1/4 of the way through the movie when you realize it's the stupidest and most ridiculous POS ever, but you wanna keep watching because maybe they'll start to possibly explain the movie or perhaps give you some background on this pathetic time technology... DON'T!!! This movie explains nothing. These people walk around with literally, their life savings on their arms! Which!! anyone can just grab and take at will. AHHHHH!!!!! are you kidding! The writer couldn't even come up with a sensible way to end the movie, just a 2 man army, about to rob the worlds biggest bank. What the....! I want my "TIME" back!!!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great book for expanding your financial knowledge.. I am on my second read of your book and have been so glad that I came across it through an Amazon search. Based on your ability to put this subject in terms that a layman can understand and the comments from your other readers, I felt comfortable enough that I have made my first trades using your system. I bought stocks in May that met the criteria and then sold the options for them. By doing the math, I can see that making 25% - 36% per year will be no problem. I feel the excitement that Jake felt in the book and I can't wait till June for my first option to be up so I can make my next trade. Thank you, thank you, thank you for writing your book.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The Psychology of Action. I have found this book to be a great reference for goal theory. Having been published in 1996, it provides another source for following the evolution of goal theory, after such books as Maehr and Braskamp's, "The Motivation Factor", and Locke and Latham's, "A Theory of Goal Setting & Task Performance". The contributing authors read like a who's who of contemporary goal setting and achievement research. It has been very helpful in my research, it collects into one book current information that I spent considerable time finding one article at a time from several journals. I'm in Sport Psychology and I have concluded it is a must have.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Rodney Respectfully Croons Some Tunes. Rodney Dangerfield has sung songs in some of his movies, most notably the animated "Rover Dangerfield" and "The 4th Tenor." Except for the last bonus track, all of the songs on this album were recorded from 2000 to 2004, when Rodney was old and in failing health. His version of "Strangers In The Night" does not compare favorably to Frank Sinatra's version, while the remix version of that tune is even worse. Rodney's song selection is somewhat strange, covering the religious hymns "I Believe" and "He." He's more enjoyable to listen to when he's singing the upbeat "I Spent My Birthday In Las Vegas" and "Rappin' Rodney," the title song taken from his 1983 comedy album. Rodney's even more enjoyable to listen to when he's telling jokes!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Awesome movie but not exactly as I remember it.. When I first saw this movie I interpreted it to be a straight up action/adventure movie. Not seeing the movie in over 20 years this interpretation is how I remembered it. I watched the movie recently and it was completely different from my memory. Not a bad film but I completely forgot about the comedy aspect of it and how it wasn't really a serious action/adventure piece in the style of the Die Hard series.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Truly a moving movie experience. I've never been a big Metallica fan... heavy metal just isn't on the top of my music list, so I was marginally interested in seeing this movie. But, I often find documentaries fascinating, so I watched it.I have to confess... I was extremely moved and captivated by what I saw. Actually, I couldnt's stop watching it. It was genuinely inspiring to see these hard-core metal icons being courageous enough to face their demons and show up real, exposing their humanity to the world ~ rather than being content to hide behind their fame.Oddly enough, this movie gave me a sense of hope ~ hey, if these spoiled, ego-centric "rock stars" can evolve and learn from their own human experience how to make peace with each other... maybe there's hope for us as a nation? My personal thanks to Metallica for having what it takes to tell the truth.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Poor Content. The information provided in this DVD series is very limited and in some cases wrong! What is provided is very basic. Anyone who has taken astronemy classes or watched another similar TV series (such as Carl Sagan's) will learn nothing new. Very broad and inacurate assumptions are made without sufficient effort to gratify them (for example a black hole may devourer our solar system). Little factual information is presented to provide a clear picture.I did not find the series entertaining, even with the decent CGI effects. I do not recommend this for anyone with a fair knowledge of astronemy.$LABEL$0,0,-100

MGM hits a new low in Tastelessness. Whoever thought up this abomination must have been out of his mind.Technically,they did a good job,sets,props,camera work,etc.A fine set of supporting actors provide characterizations that are cliches,at best.The plot doesn't even qualify as stereotypic;the dialogue is inane;and the leads don't even provide roles that manage to be one-dimensional.There is a continuous emphasis on brutal cruel,and grossly inhumane situations,terrifying horrors of the ancient world,monstrous disregard for life,and appalling barbarisms.3/5 of the way through the picture is the most atrocious sequence;a ritual human sacrifice which will outrage anyone with the moral fastidiousnessof a gila monster. ....

Overpriced, overdesigned. I love tools and that together with the look and feel of these and the fact that I spent so much should have guaranteed a positive review. Unfortunately, in actual use these are a pain. They are difficult to use one-handed. When adjusting you need to release with one hand while holding square to slide the other. When pumping them closed they don't really get that tight so you'll end out switching to the screw adjustment. I might forgive that but you also have to be careful to leave sufficient thread to release since unscrewing is the only release mechanism.So, save your $$ and get the Bessey tradesman clamps. Just slip it into position while putting it on, and twist it tight. You can get several Tradesmen for the price of one Powergrip.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Excellent first read from Cheryl Kaye Tardif. I picked this book up on a whim, and could not put it down.Ms. Kaye-Tardif has a wonderfully unique writing style that I enjoyed very much, and I am looking forward to reading more novels by her.Whale Song is the story of Sarah Richardson, who at age 11, moves to Canada from Wyoming in the summer of 1977. She is befriended by a Native American girl and her Grandmother, and they take Sarah into their family and treat her as their own.Sarah's father, Jack, worked for a company studying marine biology and Sarah often went out on the Ocean with him listening to the sounds of Killer Whales, and seeing whales close up.I love this book so much, but know that I can't say much else about it without giving away main events in the novel. If you're looking for an easy, thought provoking read, I suggest you pick up Whale Song.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Worst "concert" video ever!!!. This supposed concert video is nothing but a collection of nonsense pre-concert, backstage, and audience garbage video. It shows 2 second clips of actual "live" band footage intermixxed with camera shots bouncing all over the place.

Read the book instead. I just finished reading the book for the second time last week, and I just got done watching the dvd tonight. I've read everything by Stephen King and I think this book may be the best. The movie is not bad; Anthony Hopkins is well cast and does fine here, but the movie is like a reader's digest condensed version of a masterpiece that should not be touched. I know - you say that the book is always better than the movie. But this time the heart of the novel was removed. The characters were so much more developed, the story more supernatural. The book is a masterpiece that captures the spirit of the 60's, the magic of childhood, and the inevitable loss of everything. Skip the movie and spend an enjoyable week reading.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Comparison of new vs old release. The sole purpose of this review is to compare "The Invisible Man" in this collection to the older DVD release.EXCELLENT.

This is unquestionably worth the upgrade, regardless of all the added benefits.You can view screen capture comparisons on my website.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Hard on the ears. The first half of this CD is hard to listen to. Although music is a matter of personal taste, I find this music to be extremely irritating and grinding on the ears.

Subsequently, effectiveness can't be fairly assessed.$LABEL$0,0,-100
full catastrophe living. Although I have not yet finished the book, I can tell already that this is the best self-help book I have read. There is no difficult jargon, but still you feel taken seriously. The pace is quiet, everything is very well explained, and I really think this therapy works. That is, if you yourself are prepared to invest, because the author certainly demands a commitment. Although the term `mindfulness' is often misused by so-called therapists, this is the real thing. Do you feel stuck in a rut of negative thought, or are lived day-in, day-out by your pain, try this book. I am convinced it will help you too.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Enjoyable & informative. I found this book not only very informative & funny. The only reason I didn't give the 5th star is that it was written before the exam was released & the practice questions, while helpful to reinforce fundamentals, did not match what the exam authors came up with. In the real world, I'd trust Gary & Bob far more than the exam authors with security of a network. For sitting in a little room facing tough questions, add a good practice exam to run the score up. This book helped me pass on the first try.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointed. A friend of mine loaned this book to me, raving about the story. The packaging on the book is well done and makes it appear as if it's much bigger than it truly is. Upon reading though, I found the book to lack the depth that I presumed was there. The characters are very flat, the writing is juvenile at times, but the plot kept me going.There is so much potential in the story here, but I don't feel the writers have taken the time with their work to polish it and add depth to their work. It looks as if they're kicking two of these books out per year, which leads me to believe they're more interested in churning them out rather than creating a quality piece of fiction.Still, I keep reading them. The plot is just enough to keep me moving forward. I do see the agenda in these books, and as a Catholic, I feel somewhat offended by this. I feel like they've done a lot of stereotyping in the series.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Good, but no Rusted Angel. Expanding senses is overall a well-rounded album and deserves recognition for being so but... doesn't quite live up to it's other albums.Here it shows Darkane changing more towards melodic death than its thrashier roots.Also they got rid of Lawrence Mackrory, his replacement (Andreas Sydow) is good,but not up to par.Thankfully Peter Wildoer(ex-Arch Enemy) is still pounding the skins like usual, maybe not as good in rusted angel but hey, he's an awesome drummer anyways.Definetely worth the money, but if you're new to Darkane, check out Rusted Angel before getting Expanding Senses.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Another Hit From Strunz and Farah!. This is another great Strunz and Farah album, but it is hard to beat their previous works Americas and Heat of the Sun.

If you already own those titles and are looking for more excellent Spanish guitar music then pick up this title, Zona Torrida, Wild Muse, and Stringweave. That will give you a strong and amazing collection of music from this genre. Enjoy!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Good Holster, Great Price. BLACKHAWK! is a well known brand used by security companies, police, and military forces around the world for a reason. These holsters are good, made of a lightweight polymer, and function like they say they do. The company isn't known for putting out poor products.Mine is for a left hander on a Springfield 1911 A1 Loaded model. So I was skeptical when it said fits 1911 Government Model and Clones, considering variations can screw things up. This holster lives up to what it promised, and I love it. The best feature is that the release for your weapon relies on the finger, and by design, will place your finger on the frame and out of the trigger guard, ensuring you won't shoot yourself or discharge when you aren't ready. It helps to remove error, teaches the shooter the proper draw, and works extremely well at doing it's job: carrying your firearm. I highly recommend this holster to anyone who plans to carry their weapon.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Read Concrete Blonde first. Unlike most authors with continuing characters, Connelly has not published the Bosch stories in chronological order. Black Echo is an entertaining novel but it reveals key plot elements of The Dollmaker case, described in the Concrete Blonde. I didn't find the plot as compelling in The Black Echo as in his later books, but perhaps that's because of my lack of interest in war experiences. The writing is unusually descriptive -- I was starting to cough with all Bosch's smoking. (Surprising he wasn't the character needing a heart transplant, described in my favorite of Connelly's books (so far), Blood Work).$LABEL$1,0,-100

NEVER AGAIN!. These diapers are awful and we'll never get them again. They seemed thinner than the Huggies we normally buy, so I guess the only plus is that you can fit more in the diaper bag/in the basket on the changing table, but the positives end there. They leak like crazy - esp. when they get pretty full during naps/bedtime - we have to wake up our son to change him in the middle of the night so he doesn't wake up in wet pajamas and a puddle in the morning. Also when they fill, they sag so terribly. Our toddler quickly learned he could easily reach in when they were saggy and mess with his poop if he had any. He also easily took them off, unlike the Huggies - probably because they were sagging and uncomfortable. Unfortunately we have 222 to get through... ugh...$LABEL$0,0,-100

Benefit of Whibal smallest size. I found this item of little use for my needs. The problem really is that it takes one photo with the whibal before anything else. This adds one unit for any other number of photos. It's OK if you take quite a number of pictures in the same environment,but it's a waste if you're going to take only a few. What you get is one photo with whibal for three or so taken. However, I find that with my Canon EOS 30D, I would gain a lot more with the larger size (3.5 x 6) which would allow me to use the custon white balance. This is why I ordered a second card, this time, the right size. Unfortunately, I had to pay much more to grt what I needed.$LABEL$0,0,-100
One of his best - backup band is incredible. John Hiatt with the North Mississippi Allstars as the backup....yup, it's as good as it sounds. Great album, very "Hiatt". Similar to Walk On, with a bit more of a 'produced' feel to it. That's what makes this great though, it's definitive Hiatt with just a twist of newness to make it a fresh album.I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that the storytelling isn't as good as in previous albums. They are more abstract than what I'm used to hearing, but that allows me fit in my own interperetation of the songs, which I love. Best album I've bought in '05...$LABEL$1,0,-100
worst technical service encountered. I'm no computer expert but I can get by most stuff on my own. With Linksys, I had problem setting it up and I thought I can call them for advice. The technical support was a sham. The guy didn't want to stay on the phone for more than 5 minutes because he had to manage his resources for other users! My call to him was placed at 7 AM eastern standard time and he even admitted that no one was in the queue..but he just didn't want to stay on the phone. Even with any changes he suggested I had to reboot the computer at least once to accept the changes, which takes around 5 minutes and he refused to wait to see if my router was working for my computer. Perhaps Linksys is a good product, but I will never know because I am going to return it to voice my displeasure with their technical support.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Saturday Morning Nostalgia. Despite the overt overacting (especially from Marshall and Will), which is sometimes necessary to engage a child audience, this classic Saturday morning series is engaging for young and old - most notably for some of the classic science fiction writing. A special treat was finding out one of the episodes (The Stranger) is penned by Star Trek alum Walter Koenig.The transfer to DVD is passable, but there are some areas where the series definately shows its age and could use some restoration.The interview with Sid and Marty Krofft is very relaxed and low key and extremely interresting, too short for all these guys have done together.The Holly - Cha Ka interview is definately for the adult crowd. A good retrospective of the series, and "Holly" is definately not the innocent young blonde girl anymore!I was happy that my son, who is dinosaur crazy, found this as engaging as the modern, special effect laiden dinosaur tales.Overall a good series, worthy of more DVD's.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Complete Bourne series in Hi-def. I already have two of the three in regular DVD. When I heard that Amazon was going to bundle up all three in HD-DVD, I decided to have it reserved. The price of Ultimatum by itself is more than half of the price Amazon was asking for all three. So why not??Watching all three on 1080p was well worth the price of admission. Bonus Features of HD-DVD discs are good extras not found on the regular discs.I wish the discs came in an official sleeve that binds all three together, but they came as separate discs. A good buy!!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Borrow it, don't buy it. Other reviewers have listed the flaws (basically an Ode to Metallica, ignores important bands, dismisses punk entirely, etc) but I also have a juvenile negative reaction to anyone listing "living in Williamsburg, Brooklyn" in their bio. That one sentence speaks volumes about what is inside. No judgement, I live in Williamsburg, too, but...The book is interesting, but not worth the cover price.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Didn't work for me. I installed this item in place of the factory-supplied belt on my Powermatic 64A table saw (excellent saw, by the way). The saw was already running quiet and mostly smooth, but I was enticed by the thought of it being even smoother. Installation: The belt kept riding up on the pulleys, though I hadn't changed the alignment, and I had to mess with the motor mount, and mess, and mess, for about an hour till it spanned well. When it was mounted, the belt seemed no smoother but a LOT louder -- a high-frequency whine the saw never had before. I held off buying this item for a long time, because of the cost, and I should have left well enough alone.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A little bit of today. We truly enjoyed the movie, "The Prisoner of Second Avenue" especially since today's job market is much the same. Jack Lemmon & Anne Bancroft work wonders. After all it is a Neil Simon play and with talent like that it's no wonder folks keep inviting themselves over for a movie night. I wish more of these movies would be made.Truly enjoy.....The Prisoner of Second Avenue$LABEL$1,0,-100
Undelivered. I ordered this on Halloween for my daughter's birthday in middle of November. Am still waiting - it's now Dec 3rd! Amazon assures me it's coming (so's Christmas) and which do you think will get here first? Am about to cancel my order. What shabby service. 6 year old missed out on her birthday present is telling me never to order anything from Amazon again. A very disappointed and let down customer.

Poor presentation. When I orginally got this movie I thought it was going to be a horror movie. Maybe a B horror film at it's worst. This movie would have been ok if I was watching it on an "Afternoon Special" and I was 13 years old again at it's best. I also didn't think that this movie would have had Christian undercurrents as well. It would have been ok if it would have said that on the back of the DVD and I would not have watched it.

Dusty, noisy, cumbersome. It seems like I've had to do maintenance on this vacuum prior to each use, as if housecleaning isn't work enough!

Good niche history book. This book is well written and researched. It is devided into a number of cases in which the author describes the actions and accomplishments of various Quaker educators durring the Civil War era. Noteworthy was their fustrations with Southerners who distrusted any "teachers" from the North, especially ones who sought to educate former slaves. For someone unaware but interested in the history of Quakerism in the mid 19th century, or interested in 19th century women's history, I recomend this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great Book Scott O'Dell. The Island of the Blue Dolphins is a great book because it's about a girl who is all alone in the island and the girl had to fight so she could live before the Aleuts come to the island. I like the book because it's a true story about a girl who made friends with wild animals that could kill her.I also like it because I like animals a lot and the book is about how Karena make wild friends. I recommend this book because I know you will love it and will want to read it and read it. I give 5 stars to The Island of the Blue Dolphins.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The Joy of Meditation!. I was thrilled to discover this book and think that it has to get into the hands of more women who may be struggling with forms of meditation that do not serve all of us well. Itoffers liberation from practices that do not respect andlove the human body, especially the woman body, the sensesand sensory pleasures.

And these people have a problem with Harry?. I happened upon this book quite by accident. I was looking for a bad example of "Christian" authorship and theology (Frank Peretti specifically) and found this.I thought I'd read it all after reading Neil Anderson books, but this is absolutely dreadful. I'm shocked and dismayed that this book even exists, much less that it can be found promoted on the bookshelves of Christian bookstores.My recommendation is burn this book and read your bible. Specifically Job where it is shown that Satan has NO power over us and can do NOTHING to harm us unless God grants him permission.$LABEL$0,0,-100

If the books is called "The Moscow Option".... ...then why do we spend the majority of the book everywhere but the Eastern Front?I won't deny or disparage the actions in the Pacific and the role of the British, but if a book is supposed to be about the German war in Russia, perhaps it would do well to spend some time in that setting.Instead, we get exceptional detail regarding British actions in North Africa, followed by hour-by-hour reworkings of American actions in the Pacific - and then we get sweeping generalities regarding the German actions in Russia.The premise and title of the book are largely sidelined, as if they are of secondary importance. Why?In this case, don't judge a book neither by its cover, nor by the synopsis printed thereupon.$LABEL$0,0,-100
cheap. I have seen the movie many times, and it was as good as I remember it being.However, when I received the DVD the casing and the disk itself was made really cheap. I first thought that I had ordered someone's illegal copy that they had hand made. There were a couple language options, one of which was the original Japanese, as a native speaker, I appreciated this option. However, when the movie plays in Japanese there is no option of not having English subtitles, which was really irritating.I recommend this movie to everyone, but spend the little extra and buy a better copy of it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great replay value! I like the game.. I had Superpower 1 and couldn't wait for this one to come out. When I first attempted to play Superpower2, the game had trouble starting do to having so many bugs. The bugs were taken care of with a number of patches over the years. I played this game for many hours trying different things with different countries. Most seem to talk bad about this game, but I enjoyed playing it! I would recommend getting the game and see if it's for you. Yes you could go on for days about what the game doesn't do, (like neighboring countries not getting angry for your massive build up of military units).

Really poor quality. We have owned this printer for a little over a year. The initial setup was easy and it seemed to work fine, for a while. Print quality for the price is good.First problem, 6 months in, was it would only print the last page of multi page documents. Pain in the ---, but I just printed one page at a time. Now, it has stopped scanning from any machine. I checked online and it seems that others are having this problem as well. It says, "unabale to download applications list". I tried all of the 'solutions' offered both by users and Lexmark. Updated the drivers then uninstalled and reinstalled all of the software- twice. Lexmark owes me 4 hours of my life back. Bottom line, this printer is not good at wireless connectivity, and really not good at anything but printing. Buy something else.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Very Disappointing Book From An Otherwise Great Author. I was so completely disappointed with this terrible book. I loved Generation X, Life After God, Microserfs and Shampoo Planet and count them among my all-time favourite books, but this book is garbage. Truly. I could barely finish it, and I sold it to a used book store as soon as I plowed my way through it. The plot is stupid and absurd and I almost felt embarrassed for Coupland upon finishing it. I agree with many other reviews that Coupland's work has really gone downhill after Microserfs (ie. Girlfriend in a Coma, Miss Wyoming, and this piece of trash) but I sincerely hope readers will not judge all of his work based on this one stinker. I read that Quentin Tarantino has optioned the book, but I seriously doubt even he could make this story good.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I'm now empowered with the knowledge to meet my son's needs.. Thank God I was told about this book! Odd how the SI dysfunction diagnosis is about sensations that are not "pulled together" to get the clear picture. This book PULLED TOGETHER seemingly disconnected behaviors that my son exhibited, and gave me a CLEAR PICTURE of his diagnosis, his needs. What a relief! My son is 5 years old, born in Russia, and came to America at the age of 3. While he seems to be exceptionally smart (academically he is spelling a multitude of 3 letter words), he has been extremely hyperactive, fidgety, thumb (and now clothes) sucking, speech delayed, & sound sensitive. I am grateful for the depth and organization of the material presented in this book. It empowers me as a parent to step forward to access the services my son needs.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Simply amazing..... I went ahead and bought these even after reading several bad reviews about the cords falling apart. That was a little over a year ago and mine are still like brand new - and I wrap the cord around my mp3 player constantly. The sound is amazing...but make sure the earpieces are pushed in properly. They sit farther inside the ear than expected. That makes them block outside noise as well. Also, after finding the right earpiece size, they're very comfortable. These are excellent for the price!

Very disappointed. I am a teacher, and I bought two these staplers for everyday classroom use after reading all the positive reviews. As it turns out, these are terrible staplers! The first stapler didn't even make it a week--a student accidentally knocked it off the table, and because it is plastic instead of metal, it immediately broke. The other one made it three weeks, during which it jammed all the time and required lots of pressure in order to staple anything at all. It wouldn't open all the way, so I couldn't use it to staple papers to a bulletin board either. Finally, the second one broke durnig regular use, when I was simply stapling two pieces of notebook paper together. It jammed and was impossible to unjam without popping the spring. I'm not sure why this has so many positive reviews, but I wish I could go back and spend a bit more for some metal staplers.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I can't get live plants where I live (an island in Alaska) so both the tomato and the strawberry planters were a waste of money for me. BTW, the strawberry planter takes 15 live plants!!!

Just Because Modest Mouse Is Popular Now, Does Not Mean The Album Completely Sucks. Sure, it's not their best. All the polish erases some of the charm of Isaac's strained vocals and seemingly improvised guitar work. But it's still Modest Mouse, and it's pretty damn good. I think this is a natural progression from the Moon and Antarctica, with stronger lyrics that often deal with death and the afterlife, and a more "mature" sound (Excluding Dance Hall, which is the closest this record gets to sounding like older MM). I didn't want to like this album, what with all the radio play that Float On and Ocean Breathes Salty received, but listen with an open mind and you'll find that it's actually a good album, my favorite tracks being "Dance Hall", "Bukowski", "Satin In A Coffin", and "Ocean Breathes Salty".All indie fans should give this "sell out" record a chance.$LABEL$1,0,-100

worst fairy tale book I've seen. The book is super-barbie-girly, both in terms of illustrations and the texts. Every single story reads silly, simplistic, dry and boring.

It's Not the Product. I tried to rate this order earlier, but I think it got lost in cyber-space. I have used this product before with good results, so it is not the product per se, but the condition in which it arrived. The item was in its original packaging and appeared to be unopened. However when I opened the box the lid was off the cream bleach, and it had hardened to the point that when I mixed it with the activator it was too dry to stay on my face rendering the product useless. I see no reason to return the package as it would cost about as much as the item itself. I would consider returning it if I am sent a self addressed return package with postage prepaid and a replacement package.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A worthwhile oddity. Here's a tricky question: who is this CD for? It isn't just music, there are some sound effects, and some of the music is very brief 'stings' and 'stabs' (as they are called).Interestingly, the answer may be someone like me. I had the CD on in the background, and some of the pieces are extremely evocative - at least for people who have seen the stories they come from. There are a number of other wonderful pieces - the TARDIS takeoff from the first story is great.But, of course, the best item is the always wonderful Doctor Who theme - 4 versions, including one closing credits, which are all fabulous.

An Excellent Rendition!. I'm an avid fan of The Wheel of Time. Robert Jordan's skill at description really makes the books come alive, but to see actual artists' renditions of his world, as carefully dictated by him, was fantastic.

I Was Ripped Off. I ordered this book as a holistic reference, for which purpose it was a complete failure. I even bought the second book, "More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease." Not only was the book written poorly, it contains less real information than a supermarket rag. As if I were not defrauded enough, the book refers it's readers to a website (NaturalCures.com) where you can get the "Real, real" information not available in the book due to some kind of government regulations. So now I've paid $36 and change for two books which supposedly contain information on holistic cures, and do not, but they want to further defraud me to the tune of $9.95 a month to join the website in order to get the information which was supposed to be in the first two books in the first place.

Great book for first time parents of newborns, to help you get through the first few months. I'm an expectant first time mom and have read a number of baby books. Many of them, such as "Baby 411" and "What to Expect- the First Year" are great reference books. However, they can be a bit overwhelming, as they tell you all the possible senarios that can go wrong, and also pack information about the baby's first year(s) into one book. This book, on the other hand, is a practical read to prepare for your first few months as a parent. The authors keep it simple, and only expand on common health concerns (such as collic). Instead of scaring you with all the other worst-case health scenarios, they just tell you what symptoms warrant a doctors call. They also break things down into a lot of detail- how to swaddle, how to bathe, how to change a diaper while giving you tons of useful tips that I haven't seen in any other book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The Miner's Gold Should Stay Buried.... The Miner's Gold should stay buried, and so should this DVD! From beginning to end, this DVD was a disapointment. I chose to give it 2 stars, although it is more deserving of a 1.5. The idea itself put me in mind of a mummy film- disturb the treasure, and awaken an evil curse. First, the film seemed to "bright" to fit the horror genre. Second, the film score was not at all ominous enough to invoke any type of fearful anticipation (Except for the end of the movie!) Third, the actors looked more like teen-show actors than actors of a horror film. The only good spot in the film was a 20 second strip dance given by a well-built red head. My recommendation...this one should go back to the dust.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Extraordinary!. This is one of the best documentaries I have seen so far. My husband and I were amazed by the lives of humans around the globe. We have been urging our friends and family to see it. One can learn so much about the survival and adaptability of the human race. This documentary takes the viewer through so many emotions and, honestly, can change the views we have about the humans that inhabit this wonderful world of ours. It may sound like a cliche, but seeing Human Planet can be a life changing experience. I urge the readers of this review to buy it or borrow it. You will not be disappointed.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Tremendously Entertaining and Educational. I bought this book primarily as a dig at the Fox news network (at 40% off, why not?) thinking that Franken probably wouldn't be much of an author -- then read the whole book in two days. It is tremendously entertaining, well written and a real eye opener. Franken does get a little annoying and petty at a couple of points, but overall the book is very informative and funny. The chapter (in cartoon form) "Supply Side Jesus" contrasting a Jesus who believes in Supply Side Economics with the real Jesus of Nazareth was my favorite part, and should be required reading for every person who beleive that being a Christian means supporting Bush-style economics.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Best Video but could have made it even better. Hello,I'm one of the phenom's loyal fans. I like this video. There is no doubt that this video is a good one. It contains many wrestlers like Edge, Kane e.t.c superstars and most of the top ring announcers like J.R, King and e.t.c opinions on the Undertaker and his character, but if felt something missing liek they could have asked Mic foley's opinion.

Would be a great item but hose got holes right away. Sure wish Black and Decker would get their act together. The bag that came with the leaf vacuum lasted 1 season then the stitching on the zipper started to unwind. 2nd season of use and zipper ripped and came off track renderng the bag useless. I decided to try this instead. Worked pretty good, a slight challenge getting the cover to stay on the waste bin. Then notice holes in the hose.

Don't buy this machine!. I purchased this machine a year and a half ago to use for about three months out of the year on weekends only. This machine met my ice needs well. The problem is that the ice sensor has now gone out and there is no customer support for my problem. Neither I nor an appliance repair service can find anywhere to purchase a replacement ice sensor. Without this part, the machine is useless. Paying over $200.00 for a machine that only lasted for four months of weekend use is not my idea of a good investment. There is no customer support after purchase. So my recommendation is to stay away from spending your money on this machine. I have to throw mine in the garbage.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Appearances Can be Deceiving. I have to admit that I'll give Take2 Interactive software credit for thinking of such a great idea for a game, but they really could have put some work into it. The cover of the game looked really interesting and I couldn't wait to recieve this game, but when I tried the game, I wasn't as excited as I was in the store. The graphics are lousy, the sound is crackly, and the whole game is just bad. You run out of money when you first start the game, you can't move around as easily as you can in other simulated games like Sim City 4 or related games, and things don't appear for a really loooong time. It's a waste--do NOT buy this game--you will seriously regret it.$LABEL$0,0,-100
This book has the best scene in the whole series.... In Novemeber 1997 in Orinda CA, on a book tour for her latest Niccolo book, I had the pleasure to hear Dorothy Dunnett read aloud the "Revels" scene (essentially the last part of Part Three, Chapter 9 from The Ringed Castle) which is my favorite scene in the entire series. She is truly a remarkable woman, still hearty at 75, with a wit and intelligence rarely scene in real life. She told us she reads numerous (sometimes hundreds!) of history books before writing each novel to make sure that nothing in the novels contradicts anything from known history. She has created in the Lymond Chronicles the best historical fiction I have ever read, and the most compelling fiction of any genre I have ever read. When she does her book tour for the final Niccolo book in 2000, be sure to go see her--it may be your last chance to see one of the most remarkable women authors of the twentieth century.$LABEL$1,0,-100

TALES FROM the OVAL OFFICE or IF WALL COULD WRITE. If walls could write stories, this would have been a more interestingly written tome. MONICA'S STORYs' dispassionate tone suggest that the author was trying to protect Monica by cleverly presenting the tale as if nothing sexually exciting took place between her and the president; or the author is merely a gallant gentleman who came forward to give hope and support to a suffering young woman who had made several silly mistakes that had caught up with her and was giving her a public chastisement she and the world will long remember.Regardless what the author's intent, he managed to produce a profoundly BORING BOOK. I highly recommend it to insomniacs who have counted every sheep in the galaxy. It works better than Nembutal, guaranteed! Hopefully, this experience has taught this young lady that she can't have everything she wants and that she better stop wanting other women's husbands.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great light !!!. I really like this light. I found the lighting to be even and with no glare when positioned the right way. I thought that it might be in the way of the buttons but it wasn't at all. I used this light in complete darkness and in low light and it worked just as great in both situations. The only thing I didn't like is it requires a separate set of batteries and the batteries were not included in the packaging. I can't compare to the worm light or the shark light because I have not used either, but I did buy and return the lightboy. I was not able to see the screen very well at all!! It basically put a glare over the entire screen! The traplight was the replacement for the lightboy and after using the traplight I don't feel that I could find a better light in any of the other choices. Buy the traplight!

Another What-If Book. Since Elaine Pagels' Gnostic Gospels there has been a steady stream of books written on the subject of lost options in Christianity. This is a particularly bad example of that genre because it misrepresents the substance and nature of almost every heresy and threat it proposes to assess. Especially weak is Ehrman's treatment of Marcionism which he fundamentally misunderstands and seems to know only from the dated studies of Knox and Harnack. His idea that Marcion's view of God was too "new" for the church to accept is based on a howling anachronism in the dating of Marcion's heresy. In fact there is plenty to suggest that Marcion's solitary gospel and limited collection of Paul's letters corresponded to (and resonated with) the most ancient inclinations of Christian theology. In short, not only yet another case of popularization but a bad job of reading the evidence as well.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Why do I still own this?. I've had this herb mill for 10 years after receiving it off my wedding registry, and frankly I'm surprised they are still selling it. I thought it would make the tedious task of chopping fresh herbs much easier. Well, it doesn't. Basically, anything even remotely leafy gets macerated and caught on the tines and doesn't come loose. Then, you have to disassemble it to try to scrape off the crushed little bits, which stick together & to your fingers and are hard to distribute into whatever you are cooking. I end up getting out scissors and just using those instead. Don't bother with this...at least for fresh herbs. I guess it might work to chop dry herbs into smaller bits, but I can usually do that with my hands.$LABEL$0,0,-100

It's also a great resource to have in the dojo for first aid--over the years I have seen bits and pieces of the stuff in this book used by various teachers (e.g. cupping, moxibustion, plasters), and having it all together in one handy volume is priceless.

This book is titled incorrectly. The guts of the book are just plain stuff for beginners. The illustrations are of an architectural nature, yes, but the book says almost nothing about creating anything like those illustrations. For instance, all of the illustrations use a hand lettered font that does not ship with AutoCAD, and nowhere is it explained how fonts are copywrited or even available outside the boxed version. Plus, much of the presentation is misleading - it seems that the book is edited for newer version by pasting more stuff onto the end of a chapter. Some key points are just plain wrong.

don't like the finish. These are not what I thought I was getting. I expected the "black satin" finish to be that low gloss black wood grain type finish commonly seen on bookshelf type speakers. Instead, it's a rough black powder coat finish directly on MDF particle board. It looks like countertop formica instead of wood. As a woodworker, I have always understood a "satin" finish to mean a smooth finished surface with a subtle luster (as opposed to a glossy polyurethane finish). It seems pretty misleading to advertise these as "black satin wood" speaker stands. There is nothing "woodlike" about them.$LABEL$0,0,-100

This book contains ONLY so-called "drive-by shootings" - it's obvious this author made little efforts to capture the best lights or composition.

This book is probably intended for tourists on a bus-tour, but not for serious photographers.If you have money to waste on this book, buy two copies of "The Photographer's Guide to Yosemite" by Michael Frye.

High protein/low carbohydrate diets are inherently unhealthy.

Furthermore excessive protein may leach calcium from the bones. DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

Howard Shore's scores are magnificent but this rendition of it is pretty bad. If I could I'd give it 0 stars.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Fantastic product!. This is the BEST cleanser I have found. Not only does it keep breakouts at bay, but it makes your skin soft and complexion even.

Sorry to see it go!. I have been drinking and loving Good Earth Tea for years. I make it cold in the summer and hot in the winter... everyday! I ordered a case from Amazon last week and upon opening the first bag, I knew something was wrong from the smell but tried it anyway. It was horrible. I called Amazon and as always, they were wonderful about refunding my money. Then I called Good Earth and found out they changed the ingredients and some boxes are the old flavor and some are not. They said they now have 3 blends. Well, I can't begin to figure out which one I am getting so I am onto trying other types of tea! So it's been lovely but no more Good Earth tea for me!!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Just read and see!. This is the best Bible translation I have ever had the opportunity to read. I read in four different languages and so far this is the best, translated and interpreted Bible I have had in any language. I investigated a lot before I started meeting with the church in my city. Every accusation I encountered was either flat out a lie or a result of blindness. It troubles me that God's children are deprived from such reaches that are in the ministry of Witness Lee. We all have been gifted with a mind. If a seeking person utilizes his or her mind with an open spirit he will see what I saw in the Bible when it is opened the way it is in the Recovery version. Just read it with an open being!Most of what is said about brother Lee or the Recovery version is not the stand of the church.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Brand name and price isn't always a good indicator of the product. Taylor is well known for quality oven thermometers. I purchased this one based on their name and it was their higher priced unit. The "Connoisseur" in the brand name also swayed me to make the purchase.Although the bracket/stand the thermometer is supposed to be attached with provides for various ways of putting it in the oven... none of them work well at all. If it is clipped to a rack it can't be read. Hang it sideways... can't read it. Hang it facing the door... you can't read it. Lay it on the bottom rack (which I ended up doing) and it's readable but very difficult to read. And, it just gets worse over time as the lens tends to get coated and turns brown.I just ordered the Cuisinart brand of oven thermometer to try instead. It looks like it has an easier to read dial with better color coding.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A Good Way to Start Easing your Worries.... Easy to setup. Got its first unfinished basement reading in about 2-1/2 days, and held within .2 or .3 of that reading for several days. I then moved the unit, and got a stable but .7 different reading in a little used corner of the family room. Seems to do exactly what it claims.Only way to know would be to get a couple of units, and exchange their locations over time. If you get a high reading, you would maybe want to get a licensed inspector/contractor to come over. If the reading is not high, this may be a lesser cost way to ease your mind...Customer support is excellent - nice people. I would recommend before paying for a contractor, and even after , before letting someone proceed with thousands of dollars of remediation.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Essential reading. John Bamberger's translation of the Praktikos and Chapters on Prayer by Evagrius Ponticus should be required reading for anyone interested in the ascetic theology of ancient Christianity. Not only does he render the challenging, often elliptical, Greek of Evagrius into approachable English, but he prefaces the two works with an invaluable introduction. This century has been one of enormous progress in the study of Evagrius, and any reader of the Chapters on Prayer and the Praktikos will appreciate why such effort has been expended. Evagrius still has much to teach us.$LABEL$1,0,-100

It's always good to hear another side of the story. I'm glad to have finally read this, I knew it wouldn't be as exciting, having already read Into Thin Air, but I'm certainly glad I picked it up.

Disturbing, but for different reasons. An account of an American intellectual who submerges himself in the common rubble to learn their horrible violent, racist ways. Interestingly, each chapter is preceded by a small clippet from Victorian accounts that define and demonize the mob, i.e., the working people. Equally disturbing are author's metaphors that consistently compare people with animals. This book is exaggerated and indeed fabricated for the most part. Does violence occur during football matches--yes it does. But the author makes no attempt to explain this behaviour on a personal level; he views it as mob mentality. Furthermore, it downright insulting to the British public, which may or may not be a good thing. It is interesting, but the tone of the book is not objective--it's an elitist account, written in inflated diction, of an upper class professional "trying" to understand the vulgar culture of the masses--culture that is made of thugs, Nazis, and alcoholics, according to the writer.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Turning point. The Killing Dance held a true appeal in its romance and relationship issues for Anita. The plot of Sabin, Dumane and Cassandra however was wasted in an attempt to throw Anita and Jean-Claude's relationship into a more mature level. I feel that the older triumvirate could have been more developed as characters, in order to give more groundwork to the Richard, Jean-Claude and Anita triangle. Hamilton tends to let the deeper plot overtake the relationships sometimes, but in The Killing Dance, she put way too much focus on Anita finally choosing between her two preternatural boyfriends. The powerful ending helped draw together the novel, and especially with the reconnection between the three main characters. All in all, the book was extremely entertaining, and Anita is now going to have to face a maturity which she has not had previously.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Entertaining. I thoroughtly enjoyed this movie. It is not rocket science but that's not what I chose this movie for. Bridget's character is not flawless.

That is what is refreshing about this movie.I save 5 stars for Gone with the Wind or Polar Express, but this is close.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Can't get my child out of her new wagon!. We gave my daughter this wagon for her first birthday. She loves it! She wants to ride every morning before work and again in the afternoons. She brings friends along (human and stuffed) and there is plenty of room for four small children.

Unimpressive. I am a fairly experienced trombonist, and I purchased the cd looking for a recording of the Serocki, which I was performing at the time.

Disappointing. This is a nice looking unit, although the knobs are poorly styled compared to the rest of the exterior. The knobs are also not particularly good ergonomically. And those are the good parts. As many other reviewers have noted, the unit does go off at times for no reason and makes a continuous noise akin to a smoke alarm, only not as loud. In the middle of the night, this can be a little unsettling. The top is not properly insulated, so it gets very hot during operation. The toaster rack does not get pulled out when the door is opened. You need to reach in, which is not as safe as the alternative. The bottom tray is plain steel, not polished stainless, like others in this price range. It does not have a door in the bottom for emptying crumbs. My 10-yr old cheap Black & Decker is better overall. Until I find a toaster-oven that is nice looking AND functional, I will keep the old one.

For DVD/Movie Lovers!. I was accustomed to watching movies on my laptop but being back in school prompted me to acquire the Toshiba Portable DVD player. I bought the product and had it shipped to my home in Kingston, Jamaica, West Indies. To my delight the connections worked in my vehicle, any electrical outlet available and even on my new 40" Sony Bravia TV, and don't forget that it's portable - once the battery has been charged you can watch up to two or more movies on battery power alone. My girlfriend and I are avid movie watchers and we watch movies after work. Previously accessing the movies on the laptop was a chore for her but since getting the portable player she doesn't wait for me anymore - she watches them sometime during work hours.

Cute Movie. Thought I'd write this review to counter all the negative reviews. I really enjoyed the movie. Didn't generally care for the Mark Ruffalo character, but liked all the other participants.

Great for the price! Few "VERY" minor flaws.. I bought this product for my mother and my mother-in-law. It has a picture that looks great from far, but is far from great. If you're 5 feet away or more, you will not notice the pixelation. As you get closer, however, you will start noticing every pixel on the picture. The transfer of images is simple and the speaker is a good addition. The speaker isn't the greatest, but how many picture frames do you know that have a speaker, it's not for music videos, it's for pictures.Overall: Great gift idea, and if you want perfection, go ahead and spend that $150-$200 on another 7" frame.

Get out the bugspray!. I mistakenly purchased Rand McNally 2000 thinking it was the updated version of the software I have been using for years. I had so many problems in the first 2 days, I called customer service who walked through all my problems and came up with the same bugs on her end - she agreed with the problems, but had no idea how to fix them! One example is the measuring tool between 2 points - it doesn't work on the icon, only around it, which leaves up to a 1.5 mile variance in any given direction! After telling her how frustrated and dissapointed I was with this software, she gave me the address to return the product for full refund (90 day guarantee).Later, I realized it was Microsofts trip planner 98 and Streets 98 that I had been using. I am ordering the Microsoft 2000 version today (and returning the other product). According to other bad reviews for Rand McNally 2000 and the great reviews for Microsoft, I am not alone!$LABEL$0,0,-100

A Biblical Reconsideration of the Apparitions of Mary, 3rd ed.. Biblical Christianity is not `polytheistic' as some "christian" religions, in this case, one which not only prays to Mary to act as an intermediary between them and God/"co-redemptrix (Where is this found in the Bible?), but to various "saints" to help them in their lives instead of solely to the one, true God of the Bible, practice it. Great subject to clarify that Jesus Christ is the only one who redeems us from our sins; the only one through whom we can know we have eternal salvation (e.g., Acts 16:31)! Very simplistically written w TMI! Could have summed it up in a few pages, rather than proving and reproving his points.CAdvoc$LABEL$0,0,-100
JUST DOESN'T CUT IT!. WHEN DEALING WITH A MOVIE LIKE THIS, YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC. I MEAN, COME ON, YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT ROSE LOOKED SEVENTEEN? YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE JACK WAS THE HERO? YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE TWO PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLASSES IN REAL LIFE COULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE JUST LIKE THAT? AND DO YOU HONESTLY THINK A SEVENTEEN (SUPPOSEDLY) YEAR OLD GIRL WOULD WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE AFTER HAVING ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD? NO WAY! THIS FILM WAS JUST TOOOO UNREALISTIC. IT DIDN'T CUT IT! THIS IS A FILM WITH MANY, MANY FLAWS WHICH UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE EVEN CLOSELY CONSIDERED TO BE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! I MEAN, THE DISASTROUS SINKING OF A SHIP THAT KILLED OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH A CHEAP AND FAKE LOVE STORY.*AND DON'T THINK I DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE, CAUSE I DO. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE IN A LOVE THAT NEVER WAS.=)$LABEL$0,0,-100
Very simplistic gameplay ruins the fun -- boring after one play through. I was expecting some level of strategy but virtually all aspects of the game are wholly simplified. A great disappointment once you realise the look of the creatures is the only amusing part of the game. I'm pretty sure a patch or add-ons would _not_ make the game better.On the issue of DRM, others say it better than I can. If the game was already cracked _before_ the game was released, DRM solely penalizes the folks who actually bought the game.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Suspenseful, clean and wholesome -- thanks MHC.. Another winner by my favorite suspense author. I've read all of Ms. Clark's books. I anxiously await the release of a new one and always buy them in hardback -- can't wait for paperback! When I finish, I pass them on to my 14 year old granddaughter who loves them as much as I. Especially great is that I don't have to worry about Ms. Clark's books being unfit for my granddaughter to read. They are very pristine when compared to today's standard fare! The way I calculate it, there should be another one released soon. I can hardly wait.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Hard pill to swallow. Let's see--you've got the unappealing main gay character, desperate to be straight...a jock addicted to anti-depressants...the alcoholic sex-addicted gay best friend...and the frumpy straight girl who drowns her sorrows in rocky road ice cream and phone sex lines. Add it all up and you have yet another painful addition to the growing list of gay movies with potential that just aren't executed well at all. At best this movie evokes laughter when it probably shouldn't, at worst you wonder if you're watching a bad school play where you're the only one in the audience wondering, why does this hurt so much to watch?$LABEL$0,0,-100
It was SO close to being a good game. I bought this game expecting to be amazed at how cool the graphics looked.... I was impressed!.... At the graphics. The gameplay, on the other hand, sucks. Driver on gbc was way more entertaining than this garbage.The good;*Graphics are way ahead of gameboy standers.The Bad;*The cops sit there and smile at you while you run over the civilions of miami.*You drive like you're drunk.*You can't shoot from your car or even at certain angles.The Ugly;*This game had potential to be a great game, but it was garbage because they didn't make it as smooth as it should of been.Don't buy this game. I find it so funny how people who don't even own the game come on here and say that it's such a great game. I bought this game along with Metal Slug Advanced and Wolfenstein 3-D. I can promise you that I will not be playing "DRIV3R" any time soon. Not to mention, I'm gonna buy Doom 1 & 2 soon, so this game is gonna be gathering dust for the next 10 years on my shelf.

Works alright. The sound quality doesn't seem to be much better than with the italk alone, BUT, on the plus side, it cuts down any harddrive noise from your ipod that gets picked up by the italk sometimes. I use mine for lectures in a relatively large lecture hall and the professor doesn't use a mic. When they do, the sound is great. I only have to turn up my volume about 3/4 for the sound to be good, but when they don't, I have to sit near the front and turn the volume up all the way. My advice would be to buy the italk by itself (or any other voice recorder, it's the only one I've used and I like it) and try it out. If the noise of the harddrive bothers you, THEN get the mic.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Bible Basher. I really wish I had properly read the reviews, especially the negative ones, as I did not spot that this was a Christian based book.

Farenheit 451. I've never thought of myself as a book-burner, but after reading the beginning of this book i'm prepared to make an exception in this case. This is the most facile piece of intellectually insulting drivel I have ever read.Armed with a topic which offers a wealth of material for a skilled satirical writer, PJO totally missed the boat on this one.There is only one reason anyone should buy this book: as a self awareness test.

Worth the Read. This book is worth the read because: 1) It is a clear, accurate depiction of the accuracy and limitations of using mitochondrial DNA in tracing human migrations over tens of thousands of years; 2) It shows how mitochondrial DNA achieved this position, overcoming strong initial resistance from the scientific community; 3) It is a well-written account by one of the key researchers in the field; and 4) It shows DNA from the Y chromosome confirms the evidence of the mitochondria and offers similar possibilities for tracing paternal ancestors.The book finishes with imaginative biographies of each of the seven "daughters". Interesting enough, but if that's what you want, you might be happier with something in the Clan of the Cave Bear series.The only question left unanswered is where do I send some DNA to find out which of the seven daughters is my purely maternal ancestor?$LABEL$1,0,-100
No Minty Tingle. I'm not sure what's going on here or why there are such discrepancies between the reviews but recently I received this product from Beena Beauty Holding Inc. I was expecting to experience a minty tingle on my scalp as I have with the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product I've used before. Unfortunately the shampoo went on just like any generic shampoo except with a very strong and synthetic lavender (and to me unpleasant) odor. This definitely doesn't jive with the majority of the reviews and I'm wondering if Amazon hasn't mixed all the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product reviews together. The strong synthetic lavender scent lingers for a very long time. I won't be able to use this product due to the strong odor. I plan on looking into this to see if I can get to the bottom of it. Hopefully I can return these two bottles.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Slow, but brilliant. Many of the other reviewers have complained that this book moves too slowly. If you go into it expecting a rollicking adventure, then you'll be disappointed. This is not a novel of swords and sorcery. It's not something that you could pull from transcripts of your last D&D; campaign. And that is very much in its favor.Stevermer has painted a picture of the life of her main character. She is not your typical fantasy heroine, nor is she a wilting flower waiting to be saved by the big strong men. She's an individual, and the joy of the book is learning about Hail.The book expects more of you, too. Unless you're familiar with Renaissance Europe, and have a more than passing acquaintance with the Arthurian legends, you'll find many of the references obtuse. But for the rest of us, Caroline Stevermer has given us a rich world full of memorable characters, and my only disappointment is that the book was too short.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Little More Than I wanted To Spend, But Well Worth It. I'm 5'11, 230lbs, large build, on a budget.I searched 2 months all over Amazon and the net for a bench that was solid, not expensive, and would support me without the rattle or shakes that you would expect from cheap benches. I initially didn't want to spend no more than $150, but after reading some of the reviews on this and others, I told myself you get what you pay for and decided on the Bowflex 5.1.I've had it for a month now and I am glad I decided to pay a bit more for quality. It's solid, supports my head for flat bench presses, doesn't rattle at all (helps if you buy some floor matts), looks and functions like gym quality benches (If not better). Has more options in angles for incline than the cheaper benches. I would reccomend it for anyone looking for a quality bench but are afraid to pay $230.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Too basic and repetitive.. I was very disappointed with the content of Ms. Collins book, which is an extremely quick read. After buying this book on impulse, I felt swindled by this amateur feng shui consultant.The book focuses on the practical elements of Feng Shui: don't place your bed or desk so you can't see the door, don't buy furniture with dangerously sharp corners, clear away clutter by throwing away what you don't need or love. These common-sense ideas are repeated ad nauseum for each room of the house. A good writer would have cut half of the text.If you like books such as "Who Moved My Cheese?," which I hated because it was overly simplistic and made a two-page paper into a book, you will not like this book.If you want a very quick read, simple ideas, and some horrifyingly bad pictures, be my guest.Maybe I'm a hypocrite; I did follow one bit of her advice. After reading the book, I threw it in the trash.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Serve with port, glowing embers and your dog nearby.... With the publication of Modern Pheasant Hunting, in 1982, outdoor writer Steve Grooms told us how he hunts pheasants. In Pheasant Hunter's Harvest, he tells us why. Too long in coming, it is a book that was well worth the wait, reflecting maturation in Grooms' prose and appreciation of his subject. Along with Datus C. Proper's Pheasants of the Mind, it is one of two volumes that goes to the heart of pheasant hunting with eloquence and understanding, and stands ahead of all others. Served at the hearth with a glass of port and a trusty pointer or retriever nearby, it is a book that can be consumed over and over again, reminding us that why we hunt is more important than how. Currently out of print, it is that rare work that deserves a place in every upland bird hunter's library, and if not in their library, in the glove compartment of their pick-up truck.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Best video series I have found. I have purchased several of the video series. Baby Genius and Bee Smart are pretty good. I also having the Signing Time videos. While I love Signing Time, my son is not quite into it yet. None of them keep my 7 month old fascinated like the Baby Einstein series. I have the language skills, bach, Mozart, and Beethoven. Doolittle is a little disappointing. I have not purchased Newton yet, and may not, due to reading of the reviews. But, in comparison to the other series out there, Baby Einstein is the top. I still use the other videos, because they seem to provide more direct education. Yet, I have to work harder to keep my son's attention with the other videos.

Could have been better.......... I've been a fan of Eddie's for years. I felt that this package did not do him justice. I'm not disputing the choice of material on this CD, it's just that Eddie had such a cache of material during his Motown tenure that I was truly surprized that more wasn't included. What happened to "Son Of Sagittarius", "Eddie's Love", "The Thin Man", "One Tear" and all those other tunes that deserved to appear on a collection such as this? It's truly not fair. It's bad enough that Motown/Universal won't re-release his most popular albums. I gave it four stars because it included my favorite EJK song, "Girl You Need A Change of Mind" in its entirety and because to this day I still love the man.

Anti Christian clap-trap. For those who believe the Bible is 100% literal (it isn't) and who dwell on suffering self abuse, this book will help fit disperate and unrelated bits of shaky history into a predetermined and particularly ideological mold they may feel comfortable being poured into.But it is a history of a very STAID and stagnant Jesus--something he or what he taught was NOT. He was a radical liberal (even the New Testemant--written centuries after Christ's death admits to this), who challanged notions of church bound hierarchy's.It's a shame that organizational religion (like the Southern Baptist Convention) promotes disdain for what Jesus taught--individual personal relationship with Jesus and God.

This book is not an effective guide to teenagers.. This book not only will not help you with your teenager, it could very well make your life a living hell. It talks a lot about how to play mind games with them and talks nothing about the trust building and responsibility training that is necessary to work with any child. Example: If your child chooses not to take a shower or put on deoderant, this book suggests dousing them with the grossest smelling perfume that you can find. This not only shows complete disrespect for your child but it teaches the NOTHING except cruelty. If you need help a better book would be - "Uncommen Sense."

Solid collection of early Martin work. This is a solid package of George R.R. Martin's early short stories. But the quality varies. "Song for Lya" itself is a moving, involving, vivid, haunting, 5-star CLASSIC, & is reason enuf 4 buying the book all by itself. Also very good R "With Morning Comes Mistfall," "Second Kind of Loneliness," & "Override." Some of the rest is disappointing: "The Hero" was Martin's 1st-published story, & it's ... not bad. "FTA" is a brief joke. "Slide Show" features a series of dazzling images, but it's not much of a STORY. "Exit to San Breta" is an OK haunted-car story on a freeway of the future. "Dark Were the Tunnels" has a WAY better (& longer) sequel in George's SANDKINGS collection.

Different from their previous albums.. but still excellent!. Lonestar never ceases to amaze me! They are an excellent group with great songs and great talent. "Lonely Grill" is different from their two previous albums in the sense that I don't think it sounds as country. In fact, a few of the songs sound like pop rather than country. But I think we need to realize that country music is changing and this type of sound is what's popular right now. Best songs on the album are Amazed, Smile, What About Now, and the accoustic version of Everything's Changed. I didn't care for the first song on the album, Saturday Night, but the rest of the songs were good. I definitely recommend this album, especially if you are a Lonestar fan like me.

Hidden copper affects many people!. This book brings light to a relatively unknown topic of health concern- high tissue copper. I learned what the dangers of copper toxicity are, as well as the symptoms. I also learned which foods are high in copper, and different ways to chelate copper out of your system. Everyone should know about the copper connection! Especially anyone with chronic fatigue syndrome or hormone imbalance!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Never Again. I've owned this specific design as well as another design from this brand. The first I bought and the second was a gift. But if I ever receive this brand as a gift again, I will do everything I can to return it. Both sets broke so easily. I had a bunch of plates break while in the dishwasher. Other plates broke while being eaten off of. One broke while my boyfriend was eating a waffle off of it! A waffle! So it's not like it takes excessive force to damage these things. They just break right down the center every time. Plus, the bowls and mugs get EXTREMELY HOT just after a couple of minutes in the microwave. If you scratch off the paint, you can see a shiny, metallic surface underneath. I've read the other reviews where people have had no problems at all. I guess luck is just involved. But I wouldn't recommend taking the chance on these plates unless you have the money to throw away.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Re-Packaged New Age Nonesense at the Expense of the Faithful. Editing review - I did not intend to give five stars but ONE star. Full disclosure, when I first read this book, I thought it was great. But that was when I didn't know any better. Today, I can tell you that this is one of the most inauthentic primers of our faith out today. It claims to promote and praise ony branch of faith (Traditional Yoruba), while mocking another (Santeria), but then offers what is basically thinly veiled Santeria. His explanations and descriptions are out of the New Age cliche catalog. If you are just starting your journey to Orisa, pick up Joseph Murphy , Wande Abimbola or just about anybody else. NOT THIS BOOK. santeria.blog.com$LABEL$1,0,-100
Only one issue. I really like the business card holder as I purchased the black leather one. The arrival time was very quick. It's quality and very nice. I ordered it because it suppose hold up to 120 business card with one extra slot and mine didn't seem to have those options. I can only fit 72 cards in there and that is doubling each insert and that's my only issue with it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Must-Avoid. The content of the book is different from what is written in the back of the cover. I bought this book in the bookstore and I was interested with the short synopsis in the back cover, but then I found out that the real story is not as mentioned and that it turned out real disappointing.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Dead Battery. Brita wants to increase landfill and waste by having you throw away your 5 year-old pitchers because that's how long the battery is supposed to last in the filter replacement timers on these and similar units. My battery ran out and now I have to guess when the filter needs to be replaced. They used to have a "sticker" system on the old pitchers which was sustainable and actually better. Companies like this should be held accountable for contributing to waste pollution.$LABEL$0,0,-100

ant farms need ants.. It took 5 months for the ants to arrive, by that time the gel had dried significantly. Fortunately all the ants were dead, so no problem. Customer service was kind enough to send a new gel farm and more ants. 2/3 of the new ants arrived dead and they remaining 7 barely do anything. My son is embarrassed we gave one of these to a friend as a birthday present and is very disappointed with the toy.$LABEL$0,0,-100
flimsy. I have used these type of dressing aids for years without problems. Unfortunately, the manufacturer's decision to engineer flex into the shaft of this one makes it almost useless. The second you put any weight or resistance on it when using it for its intended purpose, it starts to bend and keeps bending until the article of clothing slips right off the s-hook. The thing is so flexible, it bends to 90 degrees, which is simply overkill. i would believe it made the dressing aid cheaper to produce, however....$LABEL$0,0,-100

Fragile and TINY. Ok so bad me for not appreciating this book is only about 1.5 inches square... very small! Cute, but tough to handle. More importantly, my toddler ripped the cover off on day two - and she is generally gentle with books. Cute but very tiny and fragile. It's also hard to know what captions go with what, so challenging to associate the text with the appropriate animal.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Bought three, two have failed!!. I was introduced to Tivoli by my brother who had a early model PAL radio. Bought two SongBooks for myself and one as a gift for my father-in-law. Really not happy with these radios. The sound is mediocre at best and I would say better for listening to talk radio than music. The blue SongBook (I bought red and blue ones) has the worst sticky finish on it and its impossible to clean and feels disgusting to pick up. The REAL reason I have to give it such a low rating is failure rate. One of mine died completely and had to be shipped back to Tivoli. My father-in-laws did the same thing and they blamed it on a faulty power cord but would not ship him a new one until he shipped them the radio and cord for assessment (and the courier charge was not covered).Finally, don't let these radios sit in the sun as they overheat and shut down. We use them by our pool but have to put them in the shade under a chair or else they fail in about 30 minutes.I would not buy another.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Good expansion, but very short. Rainbow Six: Eagle Watch is really a good expansion set for the original Rainbow Six. It only has 5 mission though. Even though it only has 5 missions, they are pretty hard, and they take place in famous places, like Big Ben in London, the US Capitol Building, and the Taj Mahal in India. There are 3 new weapons, and they are the Heckler & Koch G36K, the Heckler & Koch G3A3 assault rifles. Also, it includes the IMI .50 caliber Desert Eagle, which can kill anyone in one hit (usually).Even though it is short, it is a really good expansion for the first Rainbow Six game.$LABEL$1,0,-100

not a good deal. I bought 3 of these shirts for my husband and they are SMALL so order two sizes bigger for sure. I will not ever buy from this store again as I paid $31.99 for each shirt and they only refunded me $23.99 plus I had to pay $15 to ship them back - so basically its not worth it.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Bait and Switch. I attended a showing of this movie and was a little put off by the rabid intensity with which it was received. During an after show Q and A, any criticisms were booed, and people not completely embracing the film-makers' belief-system were branded close-minded and victims of a biased western educational world-view.I won't blindly follow anyone and did not appreciate this kind of mob rules mentality. Before closing people were encouraged to post on message, news-groups, and review-boards as often as possible.This movie was a jumbled mess. I think it's true purpose can be exposed by the many other products and services being offered under the What The Bleep Umbrella. . .Interestingly enough if one follows the money it leads to the door of a 35,000 year old spirit from Atlantis named Ramtha. This franchise has just taken it to the next level.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Freddy Invades the Real World!!!. After The Final Nightmare, Wes Craven is having nightmares again, so he decides to write a new script. Beacuse the Nightmare films have ended, the 'real' Freddy decides to come to our world. Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon are some of Freddy's targets he tries to kill. He tries to get Heather's son, Dylan too. The real Freddy is a lot scarier and more evil than Robert Englund could ever portray! Heather decides to play Nancy one last time and kill Freddy...for good! If you love the Nightmare series, and a movie within a movie, you might like WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE!!!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Velocity -- a fast-pased performance!. I have read and enjoyed most of Koontz's novels. I just about quit reading this one because it was a little more "graphic" than I like, but I did finish it and am glad I did. Koontz writes an intelligent and engulfing story. I look at his picture on the jacket and can't imagine that such a delightfully pleasant looking man can possibly carry such devious plots of murder and perversion in his head. He does have a mishevious twinkle in his eye, however. I always enjoy the perspective Koontz provides between good and evil, and, somehow, I am left with a peaceful feeling at the end, even though, at times the evil seems so encompassing.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Disappointed. First to start out with, I'd like to say that Dee Henderson is an amazing writer w/ the special gift of writing. I would not recommend this book. The other books she has written (O'Malley Series, Danger in the Shadows) were very well written, w/ the feeling that your can't turn the pages fast enough because it's so good. Unlike the others, True Valor was slow read, and I found my self skimming and completely skipping whole pharagraghs. But even tho I don't recommend this book, the others books by Dee Henderson I HIGHLY recommend.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Another Look. Bryson did a fantastic job of pumping fresh life into subjects and historical figures that have long gone cold in modern re-tellings. Newton, Einstein, Linnaeus, and a host of scientists crossing every discipline come to life as real people in the times, often bizarre times, they lived in. I could not have been more impressed with the ease with which he writes about complicated subjects and the sheer joy and astonishment captured in his prose.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Inexpensive and it works great!. This is a nice, inexpensive, easy-to-use appliance. I bought this for my 83 year old mom who doesn't do much cooking anymore and has a hard time stooping to use her oven. She loves it! It's easy for the elderly (and non-technical people) to use, it's compact and doesn't use much counter space. I highly recommend it for the price.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Thrice Staind. Staind's newest album 14 Shades of Gray, has that same special something about as Break the Cycle and Dysunction. Staind's music contains a little something something most other bands dream about, it's called truth. Aaron Lewis is a real person, who has the ability to take his thoughts and emotions and turn them into an astonishing sound. All of Staind's albums are the kind you can pop into your CD player and get that feeling in the middle of your chest that makes you say [WOW!]. 14 Shades of Gray is definately worth the [money], pick it up, and if you have more money pick up BTC and Dysfunction.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Filth, Porn, totally disgusting movie. This is possibly the most disgusting pornographic movie ever made, which tries to get people interested in ancient Roman history to buy it. It is nothing but graphic hedonistic porn from start to finish. It's a slick way for the porn industry to spread their filth where it otherwise would not be able to. If you are a Christian, stay very far from this movie. It will sicken you as it did me.I bought it only because Peter O'toole is in it. I cannot for the life of me imagine why Peter O'toole agreed to be in this filthy movie.I have marked on this movie case: smut, porn, filth; not worth watching.$LABEL$0,0,-100
