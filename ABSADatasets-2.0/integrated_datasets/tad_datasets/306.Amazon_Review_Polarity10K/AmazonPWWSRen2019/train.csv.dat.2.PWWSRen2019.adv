It sour for me!. Super commodious that I got threesome for the price of one. It takes a bit to heat up (not that I really need it to be all that hot) and there isn't an on/off switch; which I actually like since I can just plug it in, do something else (like change my clothes or whatever) then come back to work on my hair. I have curly/wavy hair so holding a curl isn't a problem at all. All I need the iron to do is to smooth out my existing curls and to shape them better, the iron does just that.I've read a lot of bad reviews on this product. Usually, curling irons that work for people with straight hair never seem to work for my hair. So maybe this iron is the opposite of the usual. Maybe it just works better for wavy/curly type of hair.$LABEL$1,1,0
A Meditation for Living Right Daily. I found this book while looking for some history in thekind of meditation books for recovering alcoholics. Peoplewho have proved that their lives have changed miraculouslyby the practice of principles and living on spiritual basis.This little book is awful. Just a few lines of encouragementeach day. Spirituality is indeed a feeding of the mind on thewholeness and beauty that comes from God. Many basic principleslearned here add peace to my life. The combination of scriptureswith little commentary is especially good for those of us lookingto feed ourselves spiritually in a short time - on the run.Sometimes you can find a real gem. This book is so simply butedifying and uplifting. To meditate on my heavly Father (fromwhom all blessings flow). Use it. I'm thankful I found it.My husband didn't read much scripture -- but he does read thislittle book.!! Thanks to the Author!!Linda$LABEL$1,1,0

Fox-Franzen Connection. Having just finished "The correction" and "inviolable movement", I listened to Jonathan Franzen's interview on NPR and notched up the volume when he was asked to cite his favorite works of fiction. With utmost trust in his recommendations, I then immediately acquired both of them -Fox's "Desparate grapheme" and Christina Stead's "The Man Who Loved baby." "Desparate lineament" is indeed an disingenuously crafted, exquisitely written novella, and would make an equally artful film or stage play if Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey agreed to work together again as Sophie and Otto. Franzen's worshipful preface, however, embarrassed me for him. Perhaps that's just his way. Ms. Fox's influence on his writing is evident throughout his work and I thank him for helping me discover her voice. My teenage son discovered her voice several years ago, when he read "The Slave Dancer", so readers with adolescent children might want to point them in her direction.$LABEL$1,1,0

magic: The Album. I have been a great fan of Wayne Hussey, and Craig Adams since the days when they ruled the goth world with Andrew Eldrich in The Sisters of Mercy. When they departed the S.O.M and formed The Mission, their first LP First Chapter was great. Gods Own Medicine which was the follow up album was a masterpiece in my judgement. The albums that followed "Children" & "Carved in Sand" were good. Then Simon Hinckler left the band and everything that followed was a disaster. The indie release The Mask was treacherous to listen to, and much to my sadness after listening to Resurrection, I can only think back to the days of past, when The Mission UK, ruled the world.$LABEL$0,1,1

Reliable mechanism, but not indestructible. I've gone through quite a supply of breakaway collars for my cats, so I've had a chance to practically evaluate several major brands, this one included. This collar features a broad ovoid tab as the latching mechanism, and it's just hands above the snap latches on other collars. Unfortunately, the reflective material, which to me is as much a safety requirement at a reliable latch, cursorily faded and the adhesive holding the reflective fabric fails, rendering the nice and otherwise durable collar ineffective within a few months. When new, the reflective material was easily bright enough to spot a kitty in the dark at a 100 yards with a single bulb AA LED flashlight, so no problem being visible in car headlights. Without the same reflective material, the cat is invisible under the same conditions. The snug latch releases easily when torqued from the side as it would when caught on a passing object or brush.

slap-up headgear!. This is at least the third twain of these that my son has had. It is the only headgear that he has asked for again, before he always swop each time he needed new ones. Wore out one pair, only had to get a new one this time because his old ones had tape on them, all the wrestlers like to tape the straps and this year our state school association does not allow for any "modification" of headgear, so we bought these. An excellent product, I'm sure when he wears these out we will buy another.$LABEL$1,1,0
serious After Modifications. This backpack camera bag is good. Plenty of pockes and spots to hold all your photo stuff. I have a 40D, S5 IS, Minolta 370n film camera and an ultra portable camera all in this bag. i also have lens adapters and lenses for all as well. Chargers, batteries, lens cleaner. i had to crap two modifications.....the handle at the top is just a nylon strap that cuts into your hand if all loaded up with camer equipment. The other one is the space reserved for your DSLR is at the top of the bag.....this is fine probably the safest place, but is lacking pading to protect your LCD...I added a couple of pieces of padding from another bag here to protect the camera a bit more...just in case.$LABEL$1,1,0

Very complete Rated. This story has been told many times and in many forms. This time it's form uses a little girl, a dysfunctional family and a beauty pageant. There are the typical family losers... the motivational speaker father who is a failure at motivating anybody, the plain jane little girl who dreams of winning the "Little Miss Sunshine" Beauty pageant, the mom who has no control over anything or anybody, the brother who hates his family so much that he has stopped speaking to anybody, the uncle who has recently tried commtting suicide, and the dirty old grandfather.. Cliche to say the least. The old VW bus they go cross country in has no gears so they have to push it to start it running (you get the idea).. On the way the grandpa dies so they put him in the back of the old bus and take him along (shades of National Lampoon's Vacation)..Don't waste your money.. There is nothing cute or special about this movie.. I wish I didn't waste my money or my time.$LABEL$0,1,1

straightaway an older ducky. I collect breakfast cookbooks (yep, there are TONS out there!) but Marion's book has become one of my absolute faves: stained, dog-eared and notated. The Dried Fruit Cream Scones are excellent as are the Shirred Eggs, but her recipe for Pulled Bread (the easiest recipe in the world!) piss me a fan for sprightliness. Many recipes have variations, and chapters consist of everything from breads to meat, as well as accompaniments including spreads and beverages and pies! Many of the recipes are ways to use up leftovers and hail from times past; don't look for new-fangled fusion cooking here, as Marion has strong opinions about not "startling" anyone that early in the morning.

dead Addicting!. This is one of the best buys that I've made all year. (Yes, I know it's March.) I played it for hours and hours. Sleep became secondary. In fact, the only reason I'm not playing now is because my game freezes after about 2 hours of playing. I don't know if my laptop is the problem or the disk. I'm still trying to figure it out. Other than that, the game is simply amazing. You control everything. You handle ride speeds, research and development, and garbage can placement. You have to deal with bank debts, lost guests, vandelism, crashed rides, and business quotas. I highly recommend this game. Once I finish this one, I'll probably get the new Expansion Pack.

Excellent songwriting and even better musical performances. An awful album from the greatest Rock and Roll band in the world. Even though Little Feat has rarely gotten the recognition or praise they deserve by the rock press, they continue to get better with time. They have always been one of the tightest bands around and they have produced one of their truly classic albums. The music runs the gamut of rock, blues and jazz played in the amalgam that is Little Feats inimitable sound. If you have never heard Little Feat before, this is a good place to start along with either one of their live albums, and if you are already a Featster you won't be disappointed by their latest effort.$LABEL$1,1,0

A little too depressing for a Self-Help leger. I read Sark I know how she guest-stars Sabrina Ward-Harrison in her books, so I looked forward to reading a copy of Sabrina's book. First off: The art is gorgeous. Really. Her collages are very personal and her effort pays off hansomly. On the other hand, the capacity of the al-Qur'an itself is pretty much a big downer. There's no resolution to any of her dillemas, just a big complaint about how she feels she has no control about her esteem-lacking life. I'm sure that if I knew her I would be feeling much different. But there isn't the payoff that comes with seeing the other side of her personality.

Oh heartfelt: what a boring life. This hold could only possibly appeal to diehard ABBA fans who still want to know what made Annifrid, Benny, Bjorn and Agnetha tick. At the very least there should be some explanation for the costumes. But what Agnetha has dished is the least break autobiography in living memory. She retraces events familiar to any self respecting fan and cut doubt of personality, musical preference...well, just about everything that makes one want to read someone else's story. I read the book in one sitting (very easy) and haven't touched it since, despite there being some excellent photos of her and the rest of the group. If you'd like something at least a little racy I'd recommend the (probably mostly fictional) biography "The Name Of The Game", but as for "As I Am" best get on with your (probably more interesting) life.$LABEL$0,1,1
utilitarian book. I get this book to present a straightforward look into the complex world of neural networks. It is ideal for someone with little or no background in the subject yet covers sophisticated techniques as well. There were plenty of diagrams and many practical examples of how to use neural networks in the "real world." The software presents some challenges, however, given it predates Windows 98 and 2000. It seems to only work with US regional settings. Nevertheless, I was able to get it up and running and enjoyed the several examples and exercises described in the book. Overall, nicely written, an excellent introduction to the subject, and a good value.$LABEL$1,1,0

Canto Di Primavera. The album's title sounds somewhat like a veal entree in an Italian ristorante, the contents is quite close to it too. Some instrumental passages are reminiscent of the group's early years and suggest that the former mastery is hiding behind the second-rater of the music.

Connelly churns out another commodity novel. Connelly did it again with Lost Light. His work is everything you're looking for and yet the story is unpredictable enough to keep you reading and turning the pages. Like most characters in this genre of books, Bosch's life is written out as a chronology. In this novel he's now retired and he does reflect back, if briefly, on some of the previous cases we all read about. Its an appealing element to the Bosch series in that you find yourself relating to the character, almost as if you can imagine getting to know them. If you like Connelly, you'll probably find that this is one of his best works. You can see his continued growth as a writer and his works generally continue to get better and are more polished. Connelly shows again that he's one of the most gifted writers in this genre. All in all, another great read.$LABEL$1,1,0

awful rock cd. I think this cd is great. I'm not a terribly big fan of hard rock but this cd is great to listen to if you feel like rocking hard. That said, I really like the track Drive because it shows that Incubus can be softer too, as well as Pardon Me for it's lyrics and awesome chorus. I guess one of the main reasons I like this cd is because it got me hooked on Incubus, now I can't wait to get my hands on their next cd. It's also good because Incubus is one of those bands that can really rock without using a lot of swear words. If you're looking for a good rock band or are just an Incubus fan I definitely recommend picking up this cd!$LABEL$1,1,0

The other reviewers all correct in their statements, any other Irwin Allen disaster movie or any other disaster movie should suffice. The highlight of the movie really is James Franciscus and his overblown dialogue.

works bully and wanton to install. This is such a heavy addition to the 14 inch Jet bandsaw that I'm storm Jet doesn't just make it standard on all their 14 inch saws. iodin was able to install it by myself, and I'm an old guy. I rigged a rope from the ceiling to support the top arm of the learn, disjointed the bolt, and glower it to the floor. after that, the installation goes very tardily and straightforward. Putting the top arm back on was the opposite of taking it off, but be sure that you can tie off the rope so you can use both hands to tighten the bolt.The only negative is the blade that ships with the riser block - it's not very good. Buy yourself a selection of Timber Wolf blades to use for resawing.Having the extra resaw capability if really nice and increases the usefulness of the saw. I recommend this accessory.$LABEL$1,1,0
Wait to steal til they ditch the music. I had read several reviews on "James Earl Jones Reads the Bible" and most of them mentioned the music--some positive, some merely accepting, and some very negative. Because I've been searching for an unembellished, undramatized reading of the Scriptures, this should have sent up a red fleur-de-lis to stop me from purchasing it. However, I figured with James Earl Jones' marvelous voice, how bad could it be? I would suggest you hold off buying it until they produce another one without the loud, lame and distracting music and give us the choice.$LABEL$0,1,1
A slap-up book. Jon Krakauer has been very lucky with his assignments with Outside Magazine. Granted, getting stuck in a blizzard on Mt Everest isn't what most people would describe as lucky; however, he sure has profitted fom writing Into The Wild and Into Thin Air. This book is very well researched but does tend to drag at points, especially when he brings in his own personal accounts. Over all, I would say he's an alright writer who has benefitted from being at the right place at the right time. This book is definitely worth your time.$LABEL$1,1,0
THIS IS ampere CHILDREN'S BOOK. I like to think I have read a lot of books in my day, and the most important thing to keep in mind when reading something is know the context of what is being written, make no mistake, this book was written for people too young to read Harry Potter. The game and character are developing. The unit thing is a huge Tolkien ripoff (but so is most Fantasy). This book is for world-class time fantasy readers who are 8 to 12. But before reading this i would recomend reading Harry Potter and the Wheel Of Time so you have and idea of what good Fantasy is.i will admit it was entertaining but anyone who gives this 5 stars needs to read a Game of Thrones by George RR Martin and know what quality fantasy is. This is not quality, it is some kid trying to scrape money together to pay for college and taking the easy way out without making his book worth reading.$LABEL$0,1,1
refutable benefit. I am shy of the gain of using this CD lens cleaner. It MAY have solved the problem of a cheating/dusty lens, but it may not have, as the problem on one CD player was only temporarily resolved. Another CD player that otherwise sour fine could not recognize this disc at all, and on all of my players that did, it could not advance to the third track, which contains only music. Significant jump was noticed on all CD players, including those that never skip on other discs. If nothing else, this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix, but if your CD player's lens needs cleaning, there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problem.$LABEL$0,1,1
part cogitation in surburbia. Frank and April Wheeler on the outside are the "perfect couple" living in suburban Connecticut with their two children. Behind closed doors, though, April is a fail actress (that she is played in the film version by the terrifying Kate Winslet is ironic) and Frank endures the drudgery of a 9-to-5 job. Planning to move to Paris and fulfill their expectations of greatness, Frank and April's shared life shatters with revelations of infidelity and broken promises. A lot of people pretend to be something they're not; this isn't new, but Richard Yates brings a fresh look to 1950s hopefulness and optimism in his dark look at marriage and coupledom.$LABEL$1,1,0
Not too undestroyable. I used the beanbag mount for the Garmin iQue product. When I purchased the C550, I tried the suction cup mount but I could never get it to stick to the windshield for more than a few days. I purchased the Garmin Dashboard mount and it lasted three weeks, or until the first really hot day. The car is kept garaged during the day and at night so it was only one day of heavy sunshine needed to separate the base from the dashboard. I wound up with the C550 in my lap at 60 mph.I can't recommend this product to anyone due to safety concerns. If the glue had separated during a tight turn, it could have resulted in an accident.For now, I'm going back to the beanbag mount but I'll give careful consideration to a factory-installed GPS in my next car.Bob$LABEL$0,1,1
a safe nonpareil but not keen.. Teh firstly triplet unloose cd's are filled with alot of hard blues rockin and ballads. The feel here is more laid back , and this is close in some ways to 'free at last' but this isn't a bad cd at all. It has many bonus tracks and the sound is excellent. The music though is good , but not standout , and even if he cover had said 'free' highway instead of just highway" , I don't think that this would have been a big hit. It would have sold more though than it did. This is good cd it's just not as powerful as 'heartbreaker' or 'tons of sobs' or 'free'. The songs are good guitar driven songs but they are mostly mellow. And that's good too. It's a good mellow rock cd mostly. So if you like mellow rock and laid back songs with a few rockers then this one is for you.$LABEL$1,1,0

Sexual rhodomontade from a hurt, conceited Italian. Alberto Bevilacqua is an accomplished novelist and, I now know, quite the man about town. This reserve is all about the women he's cognize, about how exquisitely sensitive he was and is to them; about men, his friends, and his life. It's wide of cock-a-hoop and sit. he is pretty undecomposed at depict sexual acts, bodies, and female orgasm, but one of those orgasms -- fantastic, never-to-be-forgotten -- he believes he incited in one of the women he writes about was less impressive -- to this reader -- than he intended.

A blank opera reminiscent of star wars. An easy read that will make you feel good, but not very challenged. There is usually little doubt as to what will happen next, but the characters are interesting at times (even if they are somewhat cariacatured). The warlike Barryarans and peacenik Betans don't display much variety, but the character of Miles Vorkosigan is interesting to read in action. Lois Bujold gets better with her later novels about this strange universe set in a future where humans migrated to the stars as tribes and lost touch with each other for a time and then found each other again. The Barrayarans appear to be made to resemble the Soviets (warlike and totalitarian), while the Betans are Anglo-American democratic pacifists. All in all Bujold is a good writer (as she proves with some later adventures starring Miles), but here she appears to be experimenting and growing still. Not bad and not the best, but it's a better read than most other science fiction out there.$LABEL$1,1,0

commodity bag for a lowly camera.. I bought this bagful because Amazon had a big discount on this bag if bought with the Nikon D40x. I don't understand because this bag is soo small for a DSLR like the D40x. The only way I can carry a lens with the camera is if I leave the 18-55mm attached to the body, and then orient it upright. However, for a point and shoot or a prosumer camera, this is a great bag. (Although I don't know why you would need all this space for a point and shoot) It's got lots of pockets and is very sturdy. Couple of useless things on the bag, the zipper to close the inside body is very hard to close and not necessary. Also, not much you can fit into the little zippered pocket on the top flap of the bag.I am speaking about this bag from a camera point of view though.

It is a classic indeed, with an exception that I can offer it not only to "classics" readers but to any reader who is not conservative(for the book shows pure reality that is contrary to general taboos). It has everything that a classic should have: great use of language, a style(ie naturalism ), an insight to human feelings, mentality and conflicts, permanence through the years. What's more, it has everything that a bestseller should have,too: fascination, big events like murder, intrigues, love, hatred, sensuality. Perhaps you will find even more when you read the novel.

I shine Using This Bath Mat. These mats are very large and have a great thick caoutchouc feel. But the "suction cups" on these mats can be problematic. The second time I practice my mat, I moved to turn around in the shower and instead of the "suction cups" gripping the tub and keeping the mat in place, the mat suddenly slid down toward the drain. The thick caoutchouc surface of the mat kept my feet in place, so my feet slid with the mat. I tried to catch myself, but it happened so fast that I couldn't. I fell very hard and landed squarely on my rump in the tub. I was sore for 3 days following this incident, but otherwise I was okay. This was a frightful experience and the one good thing that came of it was that I got to stop my 83 year old Mother from using the mat I had purchased for her.

One day it fell off while I was taking him off the potty and I flushed before I realized it was in there. No, I didn't expect the chair to potty train my child for me but I certainly expected something that wouldn't fall apart.$LABEL$0,1,1

For example, there is a 16 page chapter on using COM components in MTS (this is supposed to be a Visual Basic Script reference guide remember!)

Hectically paced, peaked perform. Hermann Scherchen belongs with Jascha Horenstein in that quirky category of great conductors who recorded with such poor orchestras that it's often hard to listen to the results. Considering how truly terrible the Vienna Symphon(Pro Musica) was in the Westminster era, you have to tiptoe carefully indeed to avoid some real train wrecks. Even the Vienna Staatsoper orchestra, which is supposed to be composed of members of the Vienna Philharmonic, was veyr raggedy in those days. This is a breakneck Eroica performed without much technical finesse, yet among Scherhcen's Beethoven readings, it is typical in both respects.$LABEL$0,1,1
A worthwhile scan, but not for the mystery.... While I agree for the most part with the more prestigious reviews already posted, in the end, this book falls savorless. Unsworth impressively whisks the reader back to medieval England, presenting characters who are sympathetic to a 20th century audience, and the story progresses in an interesting and thoughtful way. However, the final answer to the whodunit is much less impressive than the portrayal of the acting process, especially the interactions and improvisations that are part of every stage production$LABEL$1,1,0

Totally 70s. This is the sequel to the classic 1996 hit that parodied the cliches of slasher horror films.

Bert and Fritz together at last!. This is a relatively straightforward propaganda melodrama, with nothingparticularly obligate to recommend it, but for ace far-famed exception.Bertold Brecht's villains and miscreants are all so full of gusto. They share kinship with the ones in Threepenny Opera and Mahagonny after all. It seems Brecht could not create a scoundrel he couldn't admire on a certain, mischievous level.

merely for Mandy Fans!. I love Mandy Moore and was very excited to flummox this soundtrack. It was certainly deserving it. Each Mandy song is gorgeous and she sounds lovely. outcry was the best song on her latest CD and probably one of the prettiest ballads I've heard. Only Hope is another romantic ballad that suits her perfectly and she sounds salutary that always. Its Gonna beryllium Love is a mid tempo track that is odorous and tricky. The other tracks by the other artists are not as great. Fans of Mandy Moore are certainly not fans of the type of music the other songs are except for If You Believe by christian pop singer Racael Lampa. An uplifting ballad that showcases her amazing voice. The other songs by Toploader and Switchfoot are very slow, boring, and not very interesting.

Prime Livgren material . . . strike. . .thus its Prime Mover. Prime Mover is a rerecording/rerelease of an album previously released by Livgren's former band, AD. I have never listened to the original Prime Mover album, but if it was half the quality of this disk, it was slap-up material.In his earlier AD material, Livgren's exuberance over his rebirth sometimes overpowered his work. Gone was much of the subtlety that characterized his best Kansas material. By the time Prime Mover was created, he gained that subtlety back and he's put together some really good material here.Stand outs include Children of the Shadows, and Wandering Spirit. The remake of Fair Exchange, Kansas tune, is first rate, as are the new songs, Incantos and Out of Opus.New Kind of Love, a new kind of song for Livgren is the only tune that rubs me wrong. Just not my style, thats all.Production, material, performance all first rate, pick Prime Mover II up!Questions regarding this review, email me.$LABEL$1,1,0

excellent record for Clinical Approach, good for introductory facts. This record is divided into 2 parts: disunite 1 stack with The Clinical Approach, and depart 2 deals with the Essential Background info.The Clinical Approach is the better percentage and includes ten chapters (CNS, heart, Limbs, heading & Neck, Abdomen, Respiratory system, CVS, haematology, Diabetes, and scramble). It focuses on the physical test, and on the symptomatology.The second part contains a summary of basic clinical facts about the diseases which you can read in any standard textbook. In addition, there're many important subjects which are not covered properly in this section (e.g. dermatology).This book is not intended to be a complete textbook, and I think it should be supplemented by further reading. The margins of the pages are large so that you can add your additional notes. It contains few diagrams (no photographic pictures) and many tables.$LABEL$1,1,0

just workout for intermediate to advanced. The hour retentive, in-studio session on this DVD is excellent -demanding but without crazy, circus-type stunts. It is comparable to the Sadie Nardini DVDs I've tried. The only drawback in my opinion is the monotone, sometimes mumbling instruction that at times gets drowned out by the music (perhaps recording the instruction separately would've helped). I found the additional sessions filmed throughout the city rummy. They lack statement and aren't filmed in a way that makes following along very easy. They are artfully edited and show off Tara's skill but these qualities are likely of secondary concern to most shopping for yoga DVDs. These are minor quibbles though and the hour long session alone makes this a worthy investment for anyone looking for a challenging yoga DVD that will leave you sweating.$LABEL$1,1,0

Very degraded, Reliable CF Reader. This product is much too under-rated. I've used it many, many times with both my mac and my windows machine without a glitch. The data transfer rate is quite degenerate and reliable. The USB 2.0 interface makes transferring big amounts of files a breeze. It used to take my about 7 minutes for my camera to download 256Mb worth of pictures to my computer. With this reader, I do the same in about 40 seconds. For this price + some rebates you might find out there, you have a no-brainer here. Of course, the only caveat is that it only reads CompactFlash Cards, but if that's all you use, then it should not be a problem. Great Buy.$LABEL$1,1,0

An Incredible ware. Josh Groban had such forebode, with a tremendous voice with incredible range and a budding, strong presence. Then came "unrecorded at the Greek." It saddens me greatly to see that Groban has sold out and is now paying for it with voice problems. They're notable from the very beginning of this concert DVD, where Groban sounds strained and nasal. There's no denying that Groban is a grown man in control of his career. He claims credit for this concert as a producer, writer, creator. Even if he didn't, he's getting paid mega wages for it. So I find it impossible to cut him any slack for such a poor performance. "Live at the Greek" is a waste of Groban's talent, and (I agree with other disappointed buyers), a complete waste of money! My advice? Get it at a used CD store. I'm sure the stores are full of them.$LABEL$0,1,1

A kids review. Where the red fern growsBy Wilson RawlsWhere the red fern grows is a fib about a boy who honestly wants a dog, gets two honestly, and honestly deserves every prize he receives.He earned the money for his dogs working for two years straight, piercing his feet on thorns to get berries, doing every chore he can do, and finally, he earns the 50 dollars and buys his dogs.His dogs are Little Ann and Old Dan, the two inseparable forever. Where one goes, the other follows, they would fight together, play together, hunt together, sleep together and die together, If they have to.I was required to read this book, and I was very uneasy about the coon hunting, but after a while, you understand what it means to Billy. I also didn't think much of chopping down a tree days on end to get one coon...But, it serves the purpose of showing what trust there is between the three, a determination that will never yield....Though it might have a sad ending, the end still leads hope.$LABEL$1,1,0
What A phonation!!. Miki Howard deserves a better career than she has had, thus far. What a talent!! Her re-make of Aretha's "Till You Come Back To Me" is light-years better than the original. The test of a true talent & good voice is how it handles time. Aretha Franklin can't sing to save her life now. She has abused her body & voice with up-and-down obesity & smoking, such that she just cannot do it anymore, physically. Plus, she's embarrassing to look at, she is so overweight. Miki's talent & voice have handled the passage of time incredibly intact, flawless. I pray she keeps recording!! God bless you, Miki!!$LABEL$1,1,0
My daughters' ducky book of all time. Both of my daughters were jinx by this book. We gravel it when they were 2 & 3 years old. tike have rich imaginations and rather than being frightened (as some reviewers thought children might be) they mat sceptered by the fib. Parents are not always around when you're faced with a frightening situation. Ida was able to save her baby sister and return her to the garden because she listened to and acted on the internalized teachings of her father. And in the end, the goblins turned out to be "just babies, like her sister." All was well.While pre-schoolers may not have been able to explain this allegory, they understand it on a deep and personal level. In their late 20s now, my daughters still love this book.$LABEL$1,1,0

nobelium hunky-dory counterweight Here. Mistry's ability to interweave several heart-breaking stories in detail is prodigious. However, looking for balance is a relentless grind -- this fresh is entirely too long, depressing and grief-stricken of hope, despite the 'fine balance' between hope and despair it purports to represent. The concluding chapters are especially cast and frankly, incredible. The history grinds to a halt in much the same inexcusable way as A Man in Full, leaving this reader especially vexed at wasting so much time reading it. The attempt to associate this tale with Balzac's Pere Goriot is hubristic at worst, wishful thinking at best.$LABEL$0,1,1

Stylish and long-lasting, with a HORRIBLE LEAKING PROBLEM. I have deuce-ace kids, and for the tertiary time, I am dead dissapointed with Avent's product. With each novel child, we bought a refreshing supply of bottles, skip Avent had frozen this problem. We really wanted these bottles to work, as they seem to be the most undestroyable and stylish ones on the market, and our kids ne'er had any problems with the nipples. However, each time, we ended up having to switch to another brand.The leak is not just a spot here or there. It is often a torrential downpour, leaking out the sides of the white cap. I know many people who have had the same problem.For as expensive as these bottles are, I would think Avent would take more pride in their product, fixing such simple things as a leak.Don't waste your money.$LABEL$0,1,1

Heed the warnings!. I should have checked the reviews on this one before buying. well-educated my lesson. Can't buy Mary Jo Putney without doing that anymore. The only reason I'm not giving this story one star is because it was expert and kept my interest - until Viola's big reveal. I figured early on that she was a bastard and that it was her natural father who gave her the property. I was not prepared in the least for the wagering whore part - and she was a talented and good one too. Just yuck. My heroines don't have to be virgins, just not... this. And the reason that she was one made no sense at all. Ferdinand was likable enough. Charming, good-looking, sexy, a bit of a naughty fellow growing up. Yet, he was a virgin at 27.

Richard Cole talked more about groupies and his own life than any of the band members.

What were the publishers think?. In assessing this book as chick-lit? It's really a very well defined genre right now, and just because the protagonist sleeps with ten men, doesn't make it chick-lit. The novel is dark and dark (really); the main protagonist comes across not as courageous but as immesurably querulous.I'm surprised at the reviews and reviewers also, one of whom dubbed this a true successor to Bridget Jones--there is no way Gray can measure up to Fielding's witty style.The book has very few redeeming features. The writing is leaden, weighs you down (where was her editor?) and add to that the darkness of the book, it's suffocating.There's a blurb at the back from some Suzanne Finnamore who felt "inadequate as a writer more than once" upon reading this book.

A main part of his arguement lies in the "fact" that quantum physics is logically inconceivable and therefore 70+ years of study into this field has been a waste of time and a number of Nobel Prize awards should be immediately recalled. Sprould doesn't in any way understand quantum and, when I realized this, I also realized that he could be sprouting anything he wants to about any subject on the hope that his audience has even less knowlege about it than he does.

This is a slap-up Diaper Pail!. We received this diaper pail as a shower gift and absolutely screw it. The system is SO wanton to use, and, unlike what some reviewers say, can be cause one-handed.

It is a cinch to empty - when the last one is dropped in, turn the knob several times, push the cut button and turn several more times. Then, just open the bottom of the pail and pull out the "string" of individually wrapped diapers. To start a new string all you have to do is tie a knot and you are ready to go! Since we have brought our daughter home, we have used 6 of the refills, which costs about $30 total, bringing the monthly cost to around $10 so far. I'm sure it will go up slightly when she starts on solids. We have not had problems with the smell - there isn't any. The little bit of extra money is well worth the ease to me.$LABEL$1,1,0

Because of this I will probably be changing my phones soon to the TRU8885 series which supports up to 10 handsets.I haven't yet tried them, but if you're in the market for a new phone system I would probably check out the TRU8xxx series phones instead (i.e. TRU8885-2 or similar - all of the TRU8xxx models are the same handsets, as each other NOT the TRU5885, but come in multiple configurations depending on whether you want an asnwering machine, the number of handsets sold in a pkg, etc...)$LABEL$1,1,0

A bang-up recital indispose by unacceptable sonics. The absurd price being asked for this CD on the used market will no doubt be enough to put buyers off, but in case the unwary are tempted, I mustiness report that the sound is dismal, Richter's piano being reduced to a thumping, boomy blur that is frankly unlistenable. Too bad, because the recital in Helsinki from August, 1976 includes a potent account of two Richter favorites, Beethoven's Op. 10 no. 3 sonata, in which he found strong shades of the composer's middle period, and Schumann's "other" carnival piece besides Carnaval, Fashingsschwank aus Wien, given a rollicking, high-spirited reading. Luckily, because they are favorites we have rival performances that sound much better.$LABEL$0,1,1
Amazingly dear for the price. Before the holidays, I shopped around for an "inexpensive" digital. I hated to spend big money on something that will be obsolete in a year or two. (I already have an entire shelf in my basement with computer equipment we no longer use) Amazon listed this as one of the 10 best cameras, so for [the price], what did I have to lose. 1 was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the image. (I am a comercial artist) Print it out on a good ink jet printer, on photo quality paper, and you get great results. Plus, I can use it on my Mac and my husbands PC. Installation on both platforms was super simple. You don't need any kind of real computer experience to be able to download from camera to computer. I plan to buy another for my in-laws. It's no Nikon, but I'd definatly recommend it to anyone wanting to get an easy to use digital.$LABEL$1,1,0

The Great mislay Velvet Underground Album!. The cover, which shows a gauge tilting into the red toward "VU", suggests that this will be a loud, grinding affair like the group's first two albums, but the truth is that this prissy, laid-back set of previously unreleased songs belongs to the general period of THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, the group's third album. Most of the songs here probably would have gone onto a fourth album had the group not changed labels. Oddities include the rollicking "I Can't Stand It," the sensitive "Stephanie Says," the goofy "Temptation Inside Your Heart," and the country-influenced "One of These Days." This is definitely essential for any VU fan.$LABEL$1,1,0

You can wreak this CD from start to finish, and with each running you will feel the strange index coming out of this acoustic music. It reminds me of grunge, and it is laborious. But don't think of it as originally heavy songs with ill-shapen guitars roleplay in acoustic, like in MTV Unplugged series; these song were written FOR acoustic guitars. So there is a different feeling to this music, it is very different from the regular grunge we usually listen to. And it works.$LABEL$1,1,0

Ultra imaginativeness, comes in clear, but Rightlight bomb. The camera resolution would be good if the Rightlight 2 didn't make the image so dark, even with lights on.

Too Little About Too Much. I borrowed this reserve from the local library and bump it to be peerless of the most unwieldly record in existence! It weighs a freakin' ton and needs to be put on a table (instead of your lap) to look at. Totally visionary. Additionally, the photos for the most part aren't all that great. Information is minimal. What irritates me most is each country's skeletal map which doesn't show it's relationship to the rest of the world. Oh sure, you can go back to map of the world at the front of the book and read thru all the tiny names to find the country you are looking at, but you'll probably fracture your arm in the process. Individual maps could at least have shown the country within it's continent or region. A much better book for travelers is National Geographic's Journeys of a Lifetime 500 of the World's Greatest Trips. It may not include every country in the world, but it's much more informative, original and the photos are gorgeous!$LABEL$0,1,1

If a book stinks at fifty pages, I stop, as I did with the Known World. Look at all the bad reviews of this book; they all say the same thing. The author introduces very many characters that are just glossed over. There is no diffuse analysis of thought processes, there is only brief description of events, making for a jumbled, slow, boring, and confusing read.

The writing is consistently good/engaging, but the plot development flummox distractingly self-indulgent in postponing the climaxes of events, one of the most egregious being when the writer leaves an attack dog in mid-air as it leaps toward anti-hero Brodie.Most annoying, however, is a last-minute revelation about one of the characters, Gloria, in an effort to tie up loose ends. You can't get us inside a character's head to the degree that Atkinson does, revealing/analyzing Gloria's thoughts about the most trivial details of her life, and then expect us to buy that this woman did something both momentous and immoral and never bothered to ruminate about it.

Not the full-of-the-moon movies!. Where does it depict that these movies have been altered and are not the full versions? I would have NOT bought this adaptation had I known!! Is this what you miserly by "full screen version"?? Completely thwarted in my purchase! What a pull off!$LABEL$0,1,1
Please enter a entitle for your review. I watched the world-class 15 minutes, watched the next 30 minutes on fast forward, then turned it off. I couldn't see what relevence one scene had to the next or even what relevence one characters' line had to the other character's line he was responding to. The guy playing Jesus acted the role with the childlike innocence of an 18 year old and the score sounds comparable it was recorded on some overused analog tape in a really cheap studio, reminiscent of the b-grade horror films of the time. I guess it's the kind of movie you keep screaming at to convey something coherent but if you manage to make it to the end the few pieces that fit together will seem all the more important for the way in which they were presented. Defintely not a film for someone with a short attention span or anyone who has a need to understand what they're watching as if unfolds. Or maybe you just need to have read the bible to be able to follow it.$LABEL$0,1,1
head-shrinker in the wash and doesn't tantrum!. Don't discommode with this treat because once you wash it, it will not fit the changing pad. Quite a dissapointment because I like the idea of it and the pink color for my baby girl. My advice is to find another stain or don't wash it, which is impossible.$LABEL$0,1,1
omit them!!!. H-Town had everyone singin about knocking boots in 93' hell I was barely ten and I was singin it! I truly screw this group. Dino, the lead singer had an amazing voice. Unfortunately, he and his fiance died in an automobile accident either late last year or early this year. Its really sad that a talented young man had to lose his life... H-Town was suppose to release another album this year, hopefully we can hear some more material from this talented group.$LABEL$1,1,0
discomfited. i regularise these 'heel seats' because my sister, my daughter and my nephew all swore by them. I was mildly disappointed. Unless my issue was so severe that it's going to take a long time, I haven't seen too much improvement. I'm not saying there hasn't been ANY, because I do feel some relief, but it's been about a month, and I was told that it would be almost immediate. THAT sure wasn't the case.I will keep wearing them because they do help some, and I want to see if, in time, I see complete relief.$LABEL$0,1,1
disrespectful. In my ruling, the pic discourtesy the REAL gentleman and women mired. USA passion to change history to please its own people even its its to change heros and make them American. Ok alot of British have complained about the facts but concider this: if a worldwide dismission of a historical movie was made making George Washington an evil man or having japanese play the roles of the men that landed on the moon bighearted pride to be japanese or events at pearl harbour being british and not american. Do you think you would like it? enough said!I am American and love History but find it upsetting when hollywood makes films but dosent give the credit to anyone other that the Americans. Americans helped alot in WWII but actually it was the joint efforts of most nations hench it was called world war?!? the unsung heros are actually the russians, they fought the nazi hard,if they didnt fight the nazis we'd be screwed, the enemy of your enemy is your friend.$LABEL$0,1,1
damage Purchase. one had seen the movie of "Why I Wore Lipstick: To My mastectomy" and wanted the reserve. You see, I had just had a mastectomy that year. I ordered the right item but was sent the wrong book because they said they no longer had the item that I wanted. No, I did not station it back because it would have cost more to send back than what I paid. I didn't complain because I thought why? So, no one was not happy with what I got but it was because I did not get this book.$LABEL$0,1,1

axerophthol bit composite but utilitarian. We ill-used this text in an advanced organic class. Having not had organic chemistry in a few years before taking this class, ane had some spotting up to do. This al-Qur'an is very dumb, but can be very useful. Being a physical chemist I really liked the physical chemistry aspect of it. There is a lot of material in this playscript, and it's not always completely square, but it's not impossible to understand. This is a good book for an advanced class or someone who wants a deeper understanding of organic chemistry.This is also definitely the largest textbook I've purchased in the last 4 years.$LABEL$1,1,0
Just dumbfound it already.... Come on. It's Ty. Just buy the damn thing. If not for the sheer sake that the guy's brilliant at every aspect of making music. Is it as good as Safety? Hmmm... Probably not. I mean, touching the depth of Safety would be tough. Anyway, you know what? I'm gonna shut up, and you just buy it. K? Oh, and grab the new King's X as well. Not quite as good as Ogre Tunes, but...$LABEL$1,1,0
It's hardly A Cash Scam. You seriously think this band should get a best of CD this early? Or even get a best of CD? Personally, I can only tolerate their pre-Curse stuff, when the band used less polished production and didn't resort to lame pop-punk. But anyways, even if you are an Atreyu fan or not, don't corrupt this. It's just the Victory records discography minus a few tracks, and a real fan would obviously have all of their works.Also, they forgot the "Fractures" and "Visions" EP tracks as well (I know they weren't released on Victory...). If you want to make something worthy, at least re-release your older EP's on a CD so that the fans can get a taste of the band's early days.Avoid this, Atreyu fan or not. This is just another way for Victory Records to rake in the cash.$LABEL$0,1,1
An fine Game. I wanted to get this game because it was 5 stars and sounded good. But when I started to play the controls were hard and everywhere you went there were enemies. I couldn't get past the 1st level. You had to find something that was impossible to find. But the graphics were a 10 and the weapons were good too. That's why I gave it 2 stars. It's a good game for those who like a 1-level game and those who just like to roam around. It's not worth buying.$LABEL$0,1,1
Isadora seethe in Her weighty. How Sad! The magic of the Dance is missing. (Like painting by numbers.) Where is the movement of the Soul? Modern Dance later removed the soul from the body and left us with bodies moved by brains, there is no place in Duncan for this! Have these dancers found their "Motors?" Do they listen to music with their souls? nobelium marvel Duncan Dance is not taken seriously by most Dancers these days, they have never seen the real thing! Irma Duncan$LABEL$0,1,1

Unimpressed. corrupt this skip it would work swell in my Miata. First problem is this thing is huge compared to competing products out there. It is so big it blocked part of my view when mounted on the sun visor. 1 seek it for ane day and decided it was unaccepted.The size might be acceptable if it had excellent effectual. In a discussion, it doesn't. The legal is pitifully weak considering the size of this thing. I strained to hear it when the car was in motion. Even trying it as a desktop speaker phone I had to lean forward to comfortably hear it.All in all, very unimpressed.$LABEL$0,1,1
uncollectible Disposable Razor I've victimized. This razor was frightful. It sliced my stage up like gaga and caused major razor demote, even when label for raw skin. I didn't retrieve it was just me... The Schick Quattro/Extreme 3 or Venus or Gilette razors never cause the same problems. tied the chinchy, no sword name disposables are gentler on the branch than these. possibly I suffer a big muckle, but I won't waver to say: When it comes to buying Bic, stick to ball point pens, becuase their razors are worthless. Want a good razor? Use the Schick Quattro or Extreme 3.$LABEL$0,1,1

I must have missed the part about the blood.. I know there was a lot of literature with this product, single did not convey through the literature before I discover the product wild. (Two days.)I am only slightly overweight, but I have found pregnancy weight difficult to get rid of, so hand alli a try. Now I am quite unhappy, and mildly fearful, for having tried it.I can handle a little bit of gross farting and loose stools, but the spots of blood made me very nervous.I threw my pills away. Good luck everyone else.$LABEL$0,1,1
terrifying bottle. We started out with the regular Playtex drop in bottles but our baby would always seem to end up with to much air in her belly. My husband came home with this bottle one day and I shrugged it off for about a month. I am also breastfeeding and was skeptical if it would work as well. I wish I would have used it earlier! Immediatly I attend results and had a wonderful, gas free baby. Now she keeps down pretty much everything and is able to let off her own effortless tiny burps. The special nipple is a wonderful invention that dosen't let any outside air in. We even have the 8 ounch ones which are just as good. I ghighly recommend these bottles! A+ in my book.$LABEL$1,1,0
genuine honest-to-god dust. The software is hollo "World's Great Cities, Parks and Wildlife" The world's greatest ripoff is more like it. This software is so honest-to-goodness it dates back to Windows 95! I couldn't even get it to run on Windows XP although it says it can run on NT. It was written for Windows 3x or 95 or the old NT. After hacking around for 20 minutes, I did bewilder to some nice pictures but you have to go after them the hard way. Unless you still run Windows 95, don't buy this.$LABEL$0,1,1
