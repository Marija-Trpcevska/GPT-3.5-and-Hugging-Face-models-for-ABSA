Agreed with others here, will not purchase - waiting for Extended Version. I love these movies, they are some of my all time favorites. But most of us who love them already have them, and won't likely be forking out more money for a version that does not include the extended release.

deep end. Heralding from Glasgow, Scotland, Aqua Bassino delivers a pitch arrant album under a startling array of influences, ranging from Jazz and African rhythms, to Nu-Soul and House. "overreach and Bobs" unfolds each track with a deep and adumbrate layering of textures, a lot of which is provided by live instrumentation and vocal performances. Avoiding over sampling and the generic feel of drum machines, it favors quiet rhythms with an organic feel. At times, the piano delivers such emotionally rich melodies, a strange melancholy creeps in, and seems to resuscitate the spirits of Eric Satie and Claude Debussy.$LABEL$1,1,0
Foreign talent wasted in American film.. All state side movies featuring excellent kung fu talent like Jet Li and Jackie Chan are slow and boring because in the U.S. there are no good martial art choreographers working in Hollywood. This movie is a font in point. The first fight scene with Jet Li does'nt happen til a good 20 minutes into the movie. And the rest of the picture you see Jet in slow, week, "American"(by which I mean explosions, bullets, and one or two punches) fight scenes that are a waste of his time. You dont believe me watch this movie, then compare it to some of his sweet over-sea pictures like "Legend" or "Legend of the Red Dragon" and you'll know what Im talking about. Dont buy or even rent this piece of garbage or, any of his state side films like "The One" which is just special effects (any fight movie is sad if you need computer special effects to make your kung fu look neat like Blade 2 with Wesley Snipes).$LABEL$0,1,1

Starts out good, doesn't last-place. I liked my first Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse I bought a year ago to use with my laptop so much that I bought two more within the last six months, one for my desktop and one for my business use laptop. The mouse has great features, I liked the small "tail" and the especially the fact that the tail can swing to multiple positions to accommodate other USB plug-ins. However, that swinging tail doesn't seem to hold up for long. All three of our mouses (mice) are experiencing the same problem with losing connectivity to the PC, we can wiggle the tail or turn it to another position and it may, or may not, light its little green "good to go" light. Very, very aggravating, we expected better from Microsoft branded products.$LABEL$0,1,1

These stickers are height quality in every respect. They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems. The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only job these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers. The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond, but will pull off. It appears they are designed to do this. I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect. However, in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us. You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you.$LABEL$1,1,0

I am more to pick than Jordan. I was vacationing in Kenya when I finished "Eldest" and needed a new book desperately. The only book of interest I found a bookstore in Mombasa was Crossroads of Twilight. For some reason I do not remember, I read all previous 9 books in the Wheel of Time epic (and I use that in the negative sense). So I place the blame squarely on my shoulders for reading such an awe-inspiring leger.Jordan creates a fascinating world, but after Book III, he gets lost in his own story. Honestly, and without exaggeration, there is not ONE plot development in this book. Yes, that's correct: not one thing of importance happens in the 800+ pages. Unfortunately, that has become the norm for Robert Jordan. If you just have to finish this series (I am officially at the "I could care less" stage), do yourself a favor and skip this book and go on to Book XI.$LABEL$0,1,1

total of sport. Blackmailer overflows with colorful characters and a suspenseful plot with a well done twist at the end. The protagonist is a publisher in a down and out New York shop who is offered the chance to publish a sure fire best seller which would catapult his firm into the top ranks.Twice. And that's just in the first few chapters.After that, we dumbfound the usual goons, gams, and gunsels so popular in 1950's noir. However, there is a lot more here than just a clever plot. The author understands the publishing business and wiretapping quite well, and the reader will learn a bit about both in several well-turned passages.The plot moves quickly enough to keep us from not questioning it too much. The profusion of unusual characters keeps the book interesting all the way through. And just when we think we know what's going on, we get another twist.This is not great literature, but it is a fine way to while away a rainy Saturday afternoon.$LABEL$1,1,0
not slow for a child to enjoy. i was dissappointed with this house. My 3 year old girl loves Dora and was excited but when she started to play with it, it doesn't do often to keep a childs interest. They made one door open. No other doors,oven, cabinets, etc open. The family figurines don't fit on the couch and keep falling off. They should have made this so the figurines can use the furniture. THe world-class thing my daughter does is she goes to put the family on the furniture, and they fall off. They are hard to keep standing, not very flexible at all and i think they could have done some more things with this for them to enjoy..

Want a fun mystery? scratch with book one!. In my opinion, the "Hannah Swensen Mysteries" should definately be read in order! To me, the whole series is like one big book of friends. If you pick up this book, which is the sixth in the series, and read it before you have read the previous stories, you probably will be disappointed. Every book I read, I love Hannah, Lisa, Norman, and Moshe more! Is Hannah sodding? No! But, who is? So, if you are interested, start with book one.Yes, this book is different from the first five. But, I liked that it had a different flare. This is not my favorite in the series but I wouldn't have missed it! Don't compare this series to others! This is the type of mystery where you lean back, kick off your shoes, grab a bon bon, and enjoy a fun and entertaining story. I love the development of the characters, the funny situations, the mysteries, and the conclusions. These are definately not boring or tedious. They are light and fun.$LABEL$1,1,0

ane detest this automobile.. one hate this auto. single like to drink espresso so I absolutely cherished a machine that would make both coffee and espresso. The main job is the machine has no automatic shut off so if I leave the house and forget to manually turn off the machine, the coffee evaporates and the pot burns. I didn't think they made machines like that anymore - it should come with fire insurance. Also, the coffee results are spotty. Sometimes the coffee is great but then I've had several times when only hot water has come through. The coffee filter holder is very hard to fit into the machine. You have to line it up exactly with a hard to see notch to insert it. I have a Krups coffee grinder that has been a wonderful workhorse for me so I decided to buy this when my DeLonghi gave up the ghost (that one I loved). I would never recommend this and if you want to buy it from me, I'll give you a good deal! I am going to call Krups and see if they will take it back or exchange it. Ha, good luck to me.$LABEL$0,1,1

Biased, sapless and with little manipulation, but concise. I understand this book here in Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I like to read books.This book has an obvious anti-catholic bias.About the popes who were murdered by their catholic faith, there's nothing.The enormous failures of famous protestants such as Luther (anti-semithism and racism), Henry VIII (madness, womanizer, etc.), etc. have no place on this book.Even about the founder of pentecostalism , the pastor Charles Fox Parham who was an eugenicist, pedophile, gay and racist, there's no place in this book.The anti-catholic bias is obvious.No defects are showed, among famous protestant founders.In fact, 100% of great protestants had enormous defects.The best chapter of this book is about Islam.Showing Islam as a result of a weak easter christianity,in a chapter.This book has some very little utility.$LABEL$0,1,1

Now that the Dead had a certified hit record, how would they follow it up?

slap-up Lamp- commodity Value. I was surprised at how prissy this lamp is. It's quite heavy, all metal and has tempered milky glass - not plastic- on the underside of the shade. The base felt like it weighed several pounds. I like it because it not only provides indirect light upward, it also shines a nice diffuse light downward. There are two sockets for bulbs. It says you can use up to 150 watt bulbs -if you want that much light. It has a long cord that you pull out from the base. I did find it a bit trying at first to push all the extra cord into the pole segments that screw together. But putting things like this together is not exactly my forte.

A knife to crap you smile. Every time I pick up this fantabulous knife I smile, knowing that it's going to be fun to use. It was a gift, and one of the best gifts I have received in a long time. After ten months of heavy use it looks like raw.This knife is lighter than you might expect, which I feel helps me to work rapidly, and is just the right size for excellent control-- I tend to "choke up" on the knife and grip the blade with my thumb for extra control. Its slim profile and the granton edge mean easier chopping and the ability to easily create very thin slices. The light weight means less fatigue. As a result of excellent design, this tool can mow through great quantities of all sorts of veggies. It's also incredibly sharp. A winner and an amazing bargain.I own other Forschner products, including theR.H. Forschner by Victorinox 8-Inch Chef's Knife, Black Fibrox HandleandR H. Forschner by Victorinox 3.24-Inch Paring Knife, Small Black Polypropylene Handle. Both are also excellent.$LABEL$1,1,0
Don't devastate your time. I rented this as you usually can't go wrong with Bruce Willis and Forrest Whitaker. How unseasonable I was. none of the type are likable and by the death, I wished they would all die. Also, for a unretentive movie, it seems there were a few picture just to stretch it out. For example showing the girls driving around with loud music and smoking. 10 seconds of that was enough to get the feel for the scene. It seemed like it dragged on for 3-4 minutes. I fell asleep during part of one of those long drawn out scenes.I can only assume Wills and Whitaker did this for the money. It is awful!$LABEL$0,1,1
Cheapie Tray!. valet Bumbo, I'd be willing to pay an extra five bucks for a QUALITY tray. The one you're selling now is JUNK!The tray would be PERFECT if it stayed put and was easy to attach. My 4.fin month old can easily take the top of the tray off. I read somewhere that the top of the tray snaps into place if you work with it, but I haven't found this to be confessedly.Great idea, just needs to be improved.$LABEL$0,1,1

Behind the 8-Ball: A Recovery manoeuver for the Families of Gamblers. I'm shinny to grow through this Book. If you are looking for something positive to get yourself through a difficult time, this book is not for you. It does tell you what to look for and how to protect yourself, but does not tincture any hope for a future for the compulsive gambler, whether you are staying with them or not. Again, if you are looking for hope, this book isn't it. All it does is leave you depressed.$LABEL$0,1,1
666- Is there anything evil in there?. When you first hear the name 666, you think of something evil. WRONG! The record, Paradoxx, is full of slap-up dance tracks, and the only thing to remind of the "diablo" are the Spanish-evil-sounding lyrics. The aggressive sound of the synths is well combined with the party-shaking rhythm, the result is guaranteed to make you terpsichore.$LABEL$1,1,0
deserving it. I picked up "To Kill A King" at a movie rental place nonpareil night when I was just browsing (as usual) for something more than the action/crude comedy/horror that so often lines the shelves of the new releases. The store had only one or two copies of this one and so iodine thought I'd withdraw a tone. unity was pleasantly surprised to enunciate the least. Since that night, I purchased the DVD for my own appeal and have shared it with a few people who all liked it as well. I've watched it several times since I bought it and will watch again I'm sure. It's not often that I want to see any movie more than once or twice in a year but this one is definitely worth it, I think.$LABEL$1,1,0

eff it. I didn't think I'd be interested in this movie but I cease up absoutely eff it. I've never seen the play so it was completely new to me. I screw the music and the humor. This is a movie that will put you in a good mood for sure. All the lead characters were great but for me, it was the supporting characters that really pee-pee this a great movie. James Marsden, Amanda Bynes, Michelle Pfeiffer, and others were all great! I did feel though that John Travolta was miscast. He doesn't have a good singing voice and he seemed to be trying to be Mike Myers. If they're going to have a male for the role, I think Myers would have be perfect for it. But Travolta was still good.$LABEL$1,1,0

This book is trance.. I read the making of the atomic bomb by the same author and remianed fascinated for 800 pages. This book is equally improbable. The previous book dealt with the advances in science and the people who made them, beginning in the 19th century. The hydrogen bomb was conceived during the epoch subsequent to the making of the atomic bomb and its promoter, Edward Teller, was not a popular person at the time; he encountered resistence. The author describes the personalities who were working on these weapons, famous scientists, and their quirks and weaknesses. Also, all of the science that goes on. I did stop to study a bit.$LABEL$1,1,0
identical discomfited. My VIII class erstwhile Logos corrupt the RipStik with his keep and ane we detest it. He is serious with skates and skateboards but can only razz this a mate of foundation. I read the reviews on Amazon and people said the product was bang-up and how fun it was. He has sample to ride it and cannot let more than a few feet. I decidedly do not urge this product for a shaver. It articulate ogdoad and up but I would not even consider it unless they are in their high teens. I am very disappointed that he spent so much money and cannot ride it. The wheels spin forward and backward and in a circle at the same time. I tried to stand on it and had to hold the counter to keep my balance. It is very hard to balance because of the way the wheels spin. Would never buy this again.$LABEL$0,1,1
second-hand and too plastered. It actually is of little grandness to a listener how long and why this outfit kept in the shade. This album will, for all we know, put them away for longer still. Reason is a-plenty. To begin with, neo-romantic synhty-pop is not quite making hey these days. The material smacks of Wet Wet Wet's heydays. And anyway, this sort of nagging suicidal gloom is too much to bear in A-ha, Weeping Willows, Doves and the entire Glitterhouse label's output. On the plus side we have here 11 cute and crafty tune arrangements - but then again, vaguely reminiscent of 80's new wave era which Erasure never failed to subscibe to. Wake up, little Suzie, wake up!$LABEL$0,1,1
Perversely Uplifting. I am trying to be frugal with my five star reviews but this album deserves full marks without question. Judging by my screen name, one can safely assume that I am a Will Oldham fan.

Not too bad, but nix much rattling. Now don't get me wrong here. It's a great movie, well a good movie. But this isn't the movie, it's the comic book.The problem is, it IS the movie! There is nothing here that stands out on it's own from the movie and all the other hype. It's a good movie, but it's not a good comic book in it's own right.Or to simplify further, it'd be better if there wasn't a movie, because this is just the movie on paper (well, a movie on paper is a script, but you get the metaphor). If you've seen the movie, don't bother. If not, go ahead.$LABEL$0,1,1
authorize on the '06; you'll motive the '07 by the metre it arrives. I arrange this calendar as a Christmas present for my friend at the beginning of December with a shipping estimate of about the 16th of December, and the 16th of January is approaching and it still apparently has not shipped. In my opinion I should receive 1/12th of it for free since my friend won't be able to use the January page; along with a costless Christmas empower for next year. But instead I decided that I would do the world a favor and save them the embarrassment of wrapping and giving an empty box with an IOU note as a gift. You can't use an IOU note to keep track of the date. So please do ME a favor and pass on this calendar no matter how attractive you think an actor might be. They're not very attractive when they're stealing your hard earned greenbacks, think about that. Oh and by the way I've also been forced to give this item one star of which it doesn't deserve since to my knowledge it may not even exist. Thank You.$LABEL$0,1,1

tragedy........ one am sorry to allege this leverage was a number liquidate of money. I swallow some of the blame. I purchased this game not love that it was actually an ADD-ON game to an early version of "Combat Flight Simulator". I purchased combat of Britain as a stand alone gamy...this plain was not going to work. experience opened the package and reading the pedagogy i thought that it may work as I do have Combat Flight Simulator 3. This is not the case... Now the game required is no longer available, so I am left with a game that is absolutely useless. I emailed my issue to Amazon and was informed that I could return the item but having destroyed the packaging and the cost of returning the game to the USA, I chose not to do so.I guess it's a case of "buyer beware" and make sure you understand all the instructions.$LABEL$0,1,1
It Does Spark. When it comes out of the box and I first start using it, the air is powerful but definitely not hot enough. So the more I have used it over some months of time the hotter it has gotten, which I really like. But the last few weeks I have noticed some sparking. Freaks me out a bit! I have been buying this brand for a while and my previous ones just shut down after about a year but this ones sparks. Time to buy another blow dryer I guess. Sparking from an appliance is never good.$LABEL$0,1,1

incredibly rummy!. wow, this book was sooo suspect! This book is about a teenage boy, whose mom is a stripper at a sleezy club. He's completelly ashamed of his mom, so he doesn't tell his girlfriend. He is a typical teenage boy; very insecure. His only real friend is a girlcrazy self acclaimed doctor. This is all until he meets his future girlfriend. She's beautiful, and new to the school. When he finally gets the courage to ask her out, she automaticlally says yes.He finds later, that he really loves this girl, and he can not keep the secret about his mom. Him and his girlfriend broke his virginity, and did everything together. This book is better for teenagers, because much of the subject matter is "unsutible for young children" lol$LABEL$1,1,0

NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS. Although reasonably well-executed, this CD is performed, in its entirety, by the BB Band, apparently a studio group. This fact is not clear from Amazon's description. In fact, Amazon lists it as "Various Artists". The CD itself does not let you know it's by the BB Band on the front cover. It tells you on the side and on the back, in very fine publish. I assume people looking for these songs are also looking for the original artists--they should not buy this album.$LABEL$0,1,1
