just tremendous. this remake of a 1956 movie classic is awesome. the master movie, produced in 1956, starring Jan Sterling and Michael Redgrave was much more superior. It really told the story of Oceania and Eurasia, with much more depth than this remade DVD fiasco. Richard Burton's performance was outstanding, however placing John Hurt was a poor choice of judgment. The eurythmics soundtrack is sorry, distracting the overall view of the feel of the movie. The producer was right in removing them from the soundtrack. All we need then is Giorgio Moroder and you could dance in Victory Square! If you are able to obtain a copy of the original version (sometimes on ebay, but the George Orwell society disapproves because of copyright) compare the two, and the original is much better. The original was scored with the London Symphony Orchestra, and the 2 minute hate scene is far superior. But, until its released so that everyone can enjoy it, this DVD version you are stuck with.$LABEL$0,1,1

As Distant Experience from the Book as Possible. "The Phantom Tollbooth" is one of my favorite books. I like the text. Very unusually for a children's book, I genuinely like the illustrations -- to the extent that I'd consider hanging a few on my wall. It's a distinctive book, and it has hugely valuable object lessons for children. sol I had highschool expectations, paying to see it in a theater. They were completely daunt. The animation is weak standard fare -- a cold shock, compared to the excellence of the book illustrations. The book in some way cleverly holds the narrative together, the movie is a bunch of disjointed, cheezy, cheap cartoon shots. Director Chuck Jones did the same thing to Walt Kelly's "Pogo" -- enraging Kelly to such an extent that Kelly took control of the next Pogo film. Jones is a myopic Hollywood talent, seeing only his vision. What is deep in the book is superficial in this movie. The movie is disappointing and bland commercialism.$LABEL$0,1,1

With out a doubt I am fortunate to haved trained with both of these famous Pilates instructors.When I firstly heard that Romana was die to be on video, I thought, WOW, this is great! Unfortunately, this television does not populate up to the excellent teach of Romana. It seems like the producer and director didn't have a focued purpose: did they want to create a documentary, or, did they want to creat a mass market Pilates video? It's a little of both, and somehow, this video is neither a documentary nor a mass market video. Watching this video, I wondered if Romana had control.As I watched the performer demonstrate Pilates, she seemed self-conscious and a little nervous about which exercises were coming next sometimes.I was hoping to get a first rate documentary, and a good instructional video.

occupy but not plenty. Psycobiograghies are new in genre, but they may be enlightening, provided the subject that is being studied is analysed deeply.So, to write a similar kind of work regarding so complex a man as was Richard Nixon requires a good amount of knowledge about his life, his personal and political choices and particularly the latter for the very reason that are the most delicate : how can this be accomplished with a playscript a mere 149 pages ? Inevitably the informations here given verge on the general and the analysis done seems to be a little bit amateurish. Although the book is good to read, it certainly does not say the last word on Nixon'personality - not in the least !In the end, I appreciate the choice of having chosen former president Nixon as a subject, but that would have required a very bigger work, at least three times as big as the size of the present book.$LABEL$0,1,1

It played well in many different situations. I bought a script from Jeff several years later as I couldn't get it out of my mind and wanted to direct it.It plays well because the staging is very dim-witted with really very little set requirements and simple costumes. It concerns the story of the thieves telling us who Jesus is and what happened during that particular Easter week. It is a story told with much humor and heart. If your church is looking for an Easter show, this two man play or I had a friend who did it with a much larger cast with all the characters being fleshed out by individual actors, it is a powerful story that makes an impact.$LABEL$1,1,0

half-baked Funny. When this movie started playing, I groaned to myself. I didn't think I would be able to watch it. I don't tend to go for stupid comedy, but it soon won me over. If you liked Walk the Line (the Johnny Cash story featuring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon which was excellent), this will have you howling with laughter. It takes that basic story line and completely obliterates it with lunacy. It's so stupid that you just have to laugh. It starts to lag when Dewey meets the Beatles. That part wasn't in Walk the Line and I didn't think it added to the story. When it wraps, you feel good both from having laughed so hard and also because the ending is sweet.

This is awful and I can only think of two other playscript that can do this. This is why I rate this book with Orwell's and Huxley's.

However, three chapters into it, I wanted to start into the book and slap the characters around because they were so annoying. Everything about this volume is nettle. The coincidences are just too many; the characters are predictable. I knew exactly how it will end three chapters into the book! The fact that the professor goes through all those coincidental circumstances is just ridiculous. Also, Brown keeps re-writing the same thing over and over again....I don't know how many times he described TRANSLTR to the reader...at one point, I literally said out loud: "ok, I get it, move the hell on!".Maybe this book sucked because it was one of his firsts...not sure. Definitely wouldn't recommend it, because the reader will be disappointed. I liked his "The Lost Symbol", "Angels and Demons", and the "Da Vinci Code". This one literally p****d me off.$LABEL$0,1,1

Indiana Jones's "Kid Brother" meets the evil Set. If your wait for a unplayful repugnance movie here, you are looking in the wrong place! There is nothing scarey in this demur how much they borrowed from other movie themes. Can't anyone think of something original?? This guy is a archaeologist...and wants to throw the other team off the track of the find...so he plants a artifact in loose sand, and expects the other team to fall for it....Idiot! They also find King Tut's tomb under like 5 inches of sand...WOW...that was hard! This movie is very well written...for a High School kid...actually, I take that back, as my daughter (16) and I were laughing through the whole thing. Very silly movie.

People Shouldn't Be Ashamed!. This story is about a young deaf girl who is about 5 years old and who has an older sister who is around 12 years old. They both have long silky straight black hair. The best percentage of the book is that it had a lot of bm in the pictures. However, the pictures were black and white and some were shaded in. They had prissy big backgrounds in the story too. I recommend this story for little kids between 6 and 8 years old. If you read this book you will find a lot of things you will like.

See It For What It Is. I terminate the book last night and eff it. Rebecca's writing style is inspiring and beautiful. The story was engaging enough for me to finish in two sittings. Every life is worth a novel and we should all be so lucky as to write ours down for others to read. Many of these reviewers are judging Rebecca's choices or her parents emotional distance or accusing the book of being published only because she is Alice Walker's daughter. But there are thousands of books published each year by not so famous children. Rebecca could have rested on her duff and done nothing, but instead she used her talent as a writer to heal something inside of herself by telling her story. Read the book for what it is - an interesting account of one woman's coming of age, one woman's account of being biracial in America, one woman's story in a sea of millions. I applaud her.$LABEL$1,1,0

Buy the subtitled version instead; it does the anime justice. <i>Revolutionary Girl Utena</i>, or <i>Shoujo Kakumei Utena</i> in the Japanese, is a brilliant and complex anime, which contains the best writing and art I have ever seen. It's really unfortunate that the dub line is so dreaded. The English-language acting makes even the more profound moments of the series melodramatic and trite, and lines of dialogue have been changed from the actual translation (which can be found in the subtitled version) in such a way as to be offensive in more than one instance. The subtitled version is phenomenal; I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching a brilliant work of art, with amazing acting in the Japanese language. Words such as "travesty" are appropriate in this case, I think, to describe the butchering that took place in the dubbing of this series. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because the anime itself is so great even the dub job cannot ruin it completely.$LABEL$0,1,1

No Eyeliner Needed. This CD came out at a time when heavy metal was suffering a woeful testosterone deficiency. Rooster-haired poseurs like Poison, Warrant, and Firehouse were getting all the attention, and bands who were true to blues and rock were being largely ignored.Enter a handful of bands who nixed the image gimmickery and just offered in-your-face rock/blues/metal. One of those outfits, Dangerous Toys, brought to the table a nice mix of crummy, blues, Southern rock, and straight-forward metal. Ferocious vocals from Jason McMaster punctuated the no-nonsense attack, and the end result was a fine first effort from the Texas group.This is one of the handful of albums from the late 80s that I still listen to today.

The horn - henpecked numbers primed perfectly with Frank's unique wah - wah style and George Duke's impressive keyboard work to produce an album that has lasted through time. From the long title cut to the ultra-funky keyboard riff of "Eat that Question" to the impressive, jazzy, and spacey sounds of "Blessed Relief," this album is definitely worth buying if you are into FZ's jazz-fusion instrumental works.

I was expecting something a little smaller and wimpier, but no dice ... this thing gets tawdry. And with the adjustable bass (three settings: no bass, some bass, lots-o-bass) it sounds really wide and not "tinny" or distorted when you crank it up. I only turned it up to 6 and it seemed like I was disturbing my neighbor's peace!Plus, the radio tuner is digital, so you know if it sounds crackly that it ain't YOUR fault. I always have to pay a lil' bit for the good sound when it comes to boomboxes, but it pays off, because I'm hard on them -- 3 or 4 years, tops.

Dr.Benjamin Hobhouse. This is a reserve which simplifies QFT in a way not suitable for encyclopedism the real principles and theoretical foundations of QFT. It uses the synthetic path integral approach only, whilst the canonical approach is more appropiate to understand the foundations of QFT. For this, it is not enough to know how to write down the path integral and calculate scattering amplitudes only. It is good for an experimentalist, who wants to apply the theory of QFT to his measurments and vice versa. Who wants only to have a glance at QFT (including recent developemants) without being too superficial, the book of Michele Maggiore or the book of Thomas Banks are more useful, exactly because they present both approaches. For a major in QFT the book of George Sterman can be recommended.$LABEL$0,1,1

I've been looking for cable replacements (yes, the iGrado's are worth salvaging) but decided it was cheaper and easier to just buy new ones. Well to my surprise, the new ones are better. The cable is much thicker with a thick jacket. The Y split in the cable is much more rugged and the plug is a nice L shape now. I also noticed the headband is wider and a little more comfy. Best of all, they sound the same--GREAT.Do not be fooled by other reviews of behind-the-head headphones that get 4 and 5 stars--they sound nowhere near as good as the iGrado's.

The things the author has to say about my AB blood type just do not fit with reality as I know it. He has my physiology wrong and my personality wrong- and wrong in some very fundamental ways. Foods he says I shouldn't eat are foods that I do well on and foods that he recommends as highly beneficial give me heart burn. He says people with my blood type don't lose weight using lo-carb, high fat and protein diets i.e. (Dr.Atkins). In actuality- the Atkins diet is the only way I have ever been able to lose weight. For anyone sincerely interested in improving their health, I would recommend reading "Sugar Blues" by William Dufty, "NeanderThin" by Ray Audette and "Dr Atkins New Diet Revolution" by Dr. Atkins. These are good solid books that have seriously helped me. Not pseudo science like "Eat Right for Your Type".$LABEL$0,1,1

Welcome Back Bob. In the era of bubblegum pop crammed down our throats by the diluge of boy bands, teen-pop princesses, and tasteless record executives, Dylan's newest, "Love and Theft" is the stuff dreams are made of... arrant songwriting, lyrical prowess, and one of the pie-eyed bands ever assembled. Dylan's latest masterpiece is the long-awaited follow up to the 1997 multi-Grammy award winning "Time Out of Mind" and is more than worth the wait. If you love top-notch songwriting and the incredible group dynamic possessed by Dylan's latest band (his road band for the last several years), you need to do yourself a favor and pick up this album!Sadly, this album was released on the same date as the horrible terrorist attacks in NYC and Washington. However, leave it to Bob Dylan and his impeccable songwriting talents to add some joy and pleasure into a dark and dismal day in American history. A true masterpiece.$LABEL$1,1,0

Not undecomposed. I'm a Boston fan from way back. It seems as though with each album they've made, it gets uncollectible as time goes by. I'm at a loss for why, too. Scholz wrote most of the music back in the "old days" and Fran Cosmo sounds creepily like Brad Delp (for the most part). But this outing is far below equation. Far below. The best song on here is Cryin'. It really sounds like they should sound. Cryin' is really a good song. The rest, to me, is filler.Also, all the feel-good environmental, save-the-animals stuff plastered all over the booklet is a big turn off. It comes off as some left-wing baloney to me. I'm all for protecting the environment and unnecessary slaughter of animals, but they go too far in the cd booklet.Of course, those that read this and disagree will have all kinds of nasty things to say.

sour very well for me. I was somewhat surprised to see this trap rated so poorly because I had very good luck with it. It was the third kind I tried and I the first my mice weren't able to outsmart. Caught the whole family living in my garage over the course of a couple of months (one at a time of course). I agree with the reviewer who said you do need a hard, level, flat surface (like my concrete garage floor) for them to work properly. Also, Re: the person who said that they don't always lock shut, a tiny squirt of WD-40 on the yellow plastic tab completely eliminated that problem. They get a 4/5 only because they are a pain to clean out after each use (bait + frightened mouse = lots of pooping & peeing). Also need to get that mouse out quickly because they will overheat in such a small space and die, missing the point of a humane trap.$LABEL$1,1,0
wreak in the waist, but that's about all.. This bra is grotesque for wearing under vintage clothing, when you're going for that bullet bra look. It brings in the waist and provides that lovely rib-cage shaping so vital for 50s "new look" dresses. However, it offers very little in the way of cup support and nothing in the way of the kind of cup molding that is common with modern brassieres.

Affordable, square. Bought and installed the two-bike version. For an cheap detail, I have no complaints. Certainly, it's only as sturdy as your wall-mount point (since the spine is assembled from several poor square pipe segments, it would not hold vertical by itself, even if bike weight were well balanced). If I had my druthers, it would not hang the bikes quite as far out from the wall (a road bike or kids bike only needs 10-inch arm for hook, and this is longer), but it's a one-size-fits-all solution, and will handle even fairly wide mountain bars easily.$LABEL$1,1,0

A bragging no-no. okey, there are times you want to relax by watching something well-fixed and entertaining, so you go for a movie with a bit of this'n'that: action, violence, humor, romance. This was my premise when choosing this movie. I was hoping for very uncomplicated fun, with some mystery, action, intrigue, romance, etc. Let's face it, we might love gourmet cuisine, but every once in a while a hotdog sounds really good. Well, this hotdog was a real dog. Sure, this is a straightforward movie, with an easy to follow plot, and with many of the ingredients listed above, but the end result was bad. Wesley Snipes is such a talented actor, and somehow he gets these roles where he is a thuggy good guy, decent but not very bright, getting in trouble (as usual). Alan Alda was disappointing as the National Security Advisor. The only refreshing character was Dennis Miller almost playing himself. But in summary, this movie was way too lame and predictable, better left on the shelves.$LABEL$0,1,1
effective idea, big product. I bought this clock for my 9-year old. The sound quality is so poor that it's difficult to understand both my son's self-recorded wake up message, and the clocks pre-recorded time announcement. The volume is so loud we put the clock in a drawer when our baby is napping (in another room). Additionally, the clock is supposed to announce the time if you clap. However, it announces the time in response to all sorts of noises, such as "THREE EIGHTEEN AM" when my son rolls over in bed. High points for durability because I've "accidently" knocked it off the dresser, top bunk etc. several times and it keeps ticking. Skip it.$LABEL$0,1,1

I'm so sick and tired of bands releasing albums that aren't worthy of themselves. And the Beatles startle it all with this travesty.

tardily read. Ok, this book has its plusses and minusses. The plusses:great info, preseted in a easy to read and comprehensive fashion. It covers quite a bit in regards to the effect of insulin and simple sugars on body fat. The author also does a nice job explaining how exactly to follow a low carb diet as well as how to follow a high carb, very low fat diet.The minus: He's a little hedgy here in that he never really gives his opinions regarding what fat loss plan is best or ideal. He leaves that up to the reader to make his own decision. While I can appreciate he may have wanted to cover several topics and to leave the choice open to the reader, I think, with his knowledge in the field, he has done the reader an injustice by not being exactly clear which diet is best.Overall, enjoyed the book, was pleased and impressed and am putting a "strong buy" recommendation on it.$LABEL$1,1,0

actually really deadening - yuk!. Ray Liotta has been in some bad movies, but this one ranks veracious up there among the very forged. Some reviewers enjoyed the love story, but these two would-be star-crossed lovers were incredibly unappealing to me and dull. This film didn't wreak for me on either level - boring love story or boring revenge story. I usually enjoy even the bad Ray Liotta movies because he can be so delightfully crazy, but he isn't quite crazy enough in this one even though he's the bad guy (he does make an attempt toward the end to come through, but it's too late by then - anybody who has stuck with the movie this far, doesn't really care by now.). If you really want a star-crossed lover's tale, surely you can dig up something more exciting than this one; and there are definitely better revenge plots out there than this one.

A pleasant room to spend a couple of hours.... If you liked Steve Martin's movie, A Simple Twist of Fate, (he adapted the screenplay) then you will probably like this book. It was a degraded easy read. I blew through it in a couple of hours on a plane. An interesting story about being alone in a world full of beautiful people, when you don't feel so beautiful yourself. The emotional rollercoaster of day to day life, when you wonder if the anti-depressants are still working and a coming of age story for all three of the main characters. It's a different side of Steve Martin, his intellegence and wit shines. It's a curl up on the sofa and waste a rainy afternoon kind of book.$LABEL$1,1,0
Surrealistic and capricious. Yoshimoto's style isn't for everyone -- her writing is simple and straightforward, and these qualities too often aren't given the credit they deserve. Somehow she manages to use this method to recite taradiddle from the unusual to the bizarre to the magical -- and in so doing wreak elements of metaphysics or science fiction into the everyday. The second fib in this Scripture is a fairy tale, but one that uses the trappings of ordinary life to illustrate a near-universal experience; I think it's one of the most moving short stories I've ever read.$LABEL$1,1,0

Epson 3200 and Software Review. I launch the Epson 3200 to be an excellent upgrade from my Epson 1640. The Epson twain and the Smart Panel software worked without any problems and the scans are great. What would improve their software is to provide a PDF file for the User Guide instead of the HTM file. What I was disappointing in was the SilverFast software. After changing a few settings the software stopped working altogether. LaserSoft, the company that makes SilverFast, does not provide any non-chargeable phone support for installation problems. Many companies offer a 30-day free installation support but not LaserSoft. Fortunately, I found a software upgrade on the Internet but it does make one wonder about quality control. Also, I found their manuals difficult to read. It appears that they were written by engineers and embellished by product management. A good technical writer and editor could certainly improve the documentation.$LABEL$1,1,0

Long-distance hike through knee-deep mud. I couldn't wait to get this book after reading the reviews. I'm a lover of serious literature. I was disappointed to find the characters loathsome and tedious. I need at least one person in a story whom I like and am rooting for. I didn't even feel compassion for these people. They are so infuriatingly self-destructive, irresponsible, selfish, and emotionally lazy.The account itself was foresightful, slow and unengaging. I dragged myself through it in hopes of a pay-off in the end, but the "corrections" were skimpy, simplistic, and left me frustrated and irritable. The writing itself was pretentious and tiresome. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.Franzen seems skilled and smart, but defeated by his own self-consciousness. I hope to see better from him.$LABEL$0,1,1

DON'T thriftlessness YOUR MONEY!. The movie on the second disc is billed as the original theatrical release. This is only partly true. It was shown in 1977, but this was after it was cut to a commercial length. I am not a die hard purist, so don't get this wrong. However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character "Biggs" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length. I guess George Lucas just doesn't care about those of us who cherished the first release, which sadly now no longer exists for those who desire to see it. Shame on you Mr. Lucas!!Moral: Don't waste your money!$LABEL$0,1,1

risible masterwork.. I've read a few of Barth's books and this one standsout for sheer entertainment value and laughs. I thinkBarth has an original satirical mind but you mightnot agree.The book is long - and I'm a little averse to long novels.I dislike getting into a book and discovering thatI'm far from finishing and not enjoying it much - yetstill feeling somehow committed. I did not have thisproblem with The Sot-Weed Factor.Even right now I am reading an 800 page novel by one ofour great American writers...

Don't discommode reading this book unless you have a lot of time.

title doesn't do the book justness. The title makes it sound like a clone of Atkins, but it's not. I think this is unfortunate, because the book gets doomed in a sea of diet al-Qur'an. As a diet book, this isn't the best, but this is much more than just a diet book. There is some overlap in information, but Dr. Ullis puts much more emphasis on exercise with even a section of illustrated strength training exercises. Atkins and other low carb diets are about keeping insulin levels down to burn fat. Ullis talks about that, but also about balancing all your hormones for improved health, longer life, and to reverse the affects of aging. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into the technical details as much as I would like (which accounts for the deduction of one star), but there are definitely some good things to learn about this book. Ullis emphasizes not only what to eat and how to exercise, but also timing. So, I think this is a worthwhile read.$LABEL$1,1,0

Be inclined to mislay a cluster of rice. care basically everyone else, I bought this rice cooker to replace an old one, whose non-stick coating was starting to flake. The idea of a stainless steel bowl really appealed to me, but the reality of it is that you're loss to misplace a sight of rice when cooking a batch.There are a few recommendations for reducing the effect of this, the most helpful being to coat the bowl with oil (I haven't tried a cooking spray yet) prior to adding rice and water, but it won't completely solve the problem and it also affects the taste of the rice.Soaking the bowl overnight does allow for easy cleaning, but it's still a bummer to have a substantial layer of rice go down the sink (or, if you don't have garbage disposal, to be fished out of the strainer and into the trash).This might just be the trade off, for being able to avoid aluminum or non-stick coating, but be prepared for it.$LABEL$0,1,1

Considering that 95% of all anime is based on a ludicrous premise and then pretending it is normal, parent swapping hardly seems that far fetched when compared to giant robots and/or psychic powers. After all, excepting something that isn't normal as an operating truth is kind of the point. I retrieve this series trys to show how wanton it is to get confused by emotions. Also, this series made me laugh out loud quite a bit.

We were planning experts. But we couldn't implement.

This album clears up the past!. After just a few listenings of this CD, it becomes abundantly unclouded that Scott Stapp's contribution to Creed was often less than he would have had us believe. This album is shallow, OBVIOUS, and contrived. His "lyrics" are very simple and predictable, and the overall tone of the album is really a poorly executed clone of earlier Creed. What this album want is originality and imagination....well......that and a SONGWRITER.Oddly enough, I read an interview today with Scott Stapp saying that he WAS basically the whole Creed sound. I couldn't disagree more.......although the throaty voice that bores you to tears is here in this new effort, the songwiriting here is just very immature..

All of the dynmaics seem exaggerated and the solid performance seems so mannered that the players call attention to themselves rather than to the music.

While consuming "aggressors" ' deeds.... Really prissy doco required a personal bravery and some financial gambling to produce while an artist traveled terrorist-infested zones of Iraq, the Palestinian Authority and frontier Israel.What I like in this movie personally is depicting the surrounding as visualized and seen by a stranger to localities. What does not grasp my appreciation much is openly aired producer's own interpretation of historical facts, which prepared a viewer to particular conclusions in advance explicitly.Nice music undisputedly as a nice idea of keeping peace worldwide was, to a reviewer's feeling, much spoiled with dilettante simplicity of complex affairs by a critic himself consuming the "aggressors" ` deeds either directly or indirectly.$LABEL$1,1,0

My last cordless would become through the day fine, even make it through an hour or so the next day if I forgot to charge it. This thing goes out after about 3 hours of talk time. I'm on the phone a lot, so I need something that lasts a little longer.Third, after just a couple weeks, I can already feel the flimsy nature of the phone.

Frontwoman Terri Nunn has a beautiful and powerful voice, she's dumbfound some pipes!The song, Take my Breath Away ultimately caused a riff between the band and their creative process became threatened due to the popularity of that song.

Card lame genre hit the gamecube. This is the safe plot that no one bed about. It is a card back based (like Magic: The Gathering) RPG. This makes the gage very interesting and fun. The graphics are superb (weigh 2001 release), sound is okay, and the controls are very nonrational. The game is relatively easy for an RPG, with occasional places of difficulty.

doodly-squat Flynn winnings again...and it's fifty-fifty more fun.... McGrory continues the fetching saga of jackfruit Flynn. The playscript is yearner than the first in the series and perhaps a bit respectable. The plot avoids some of the aburdist elements of the first. The al-Qur'an is paced well and Flynn remains a charmer. It was prissy to see how he has grown in life. iodine was surprised to see that the FBI love interest from the first book was not even mentioned here. What happened to her? Elizabeth Riggs is far better character, but still...I was glad my favorite fictional golden retriever Baker was back. It was great to meet Hank Sweeney too. McGrory's work is at times light and funny--Flynn is a great alter ego. The bigger mystery is still a bit nutty and unrealistic, but fascinating all the rest.

To my surprise, the author expresses strongly negative opinions towards some of Plato's conclusions, while maintaining that Plato "asked the right questions."The author presents Plato as a proto-fascist.

Good gameplay, tremendous story. The graphics were great. The battle system was different than most RPGs, but it was ok. The gameplay was pretty good (like camera angles, manuverability, ect.) But there were a lot of things I didn't like. The story line started out ok but got really boring and was kinda stupid as it progressed. And the end was tremendous. The 30 mins or so it took to watch it could have been much better spent doing ANYTHING else. I also didn't like the method for upgrading weapons. You had to recruit people to make stuff, make certain items and then add it your weapon. But they never made anything all that great for me (and I spent many hours trying).

the journey and not the destination. I detect this book to be wholly and completely rent. While it's true that Murakami does leave many, in fact, dozens of questions unanswered, I believe the beauty of his book is in the journey and not the destination of the story. Toru is clearly overwhelmed by the ambiguity of both his situation and the people he meets. He searches for something "concrete" that he can wrap his head around.

It's jolly awesome.. Stephen Baldwin is a horror writer who discovers he has an identical, murderous clone. This silly Dean Koontz adaptation is free-base off of his equally goofy new, so it's no surprise the script has all the typical Koontz plot elements: Government conspiracy, heroes going on the run, and a final fight in the middle of nowhere. The only difference is that the mystery is revealed at the beginning! Overlong miniseries (Which actually features nudity in the video version)features countless leapholes in logic, unconvincing special effects, and a hilariously wooden Stephen Baldwin as the writer and killer. You can count the number of good Koontz novels and movies on one hand (Phantoms, anyone?), and this sure as hell isn't one of them.$LABEL$0,1,1
maybe shallow than its field.. This is a very piteous al-Qur'an. It has almost nothing to do with la Vegas at all. It midpoint on porn asterisk and the porn industry, and the people profiled are most vapid and boring along with being incapable of reflection. The narrator's inability to seduce note of their deficient qualities and provide any sort of insight is its real flaw; yet, as Sheehan appears incapable of judging anything or anybody which is indicative of many an academic nowadays. These types concentrate on being "tolerant" and "non-judgmental" which results in their having nothing to say. Porn is a means to an end for most guys. It isn't intriguing or meaningful. It's something in lieu of something else. If you enjoy reading about Las Vegas, I'd advise you to look at other titles.$LABEL$0,1,1
remixes came too previous to save the song. world-class of all, like my title says, these remixes came to late for the club crowd. But, if you like Willa you'll be intrested anyway:ace. Mike Rizzo Club Mix (6.39): Love this mix it speeds up the chorus vocals but keeps the verse vocals at almost regular speed. Really cool beat. Best mix in my opinion.2. Sal Parm {of Plasmic Honey}Club Mix (9.14): Sal doesn't do a very good job. The track is cool but the vocals are way too slow for the bpm (beats per minute). Same goes for his radio edit.3. Mike Rizzo Hyper Vocal Mix (6.09): Hyper vocal indeed. If I didn't know the words to this song by memory I wouldn't be able to understand the verses in this mix. They just go by too fast.4. Sal Parm Dub (7.14): Very, very disappointing. Usually, even when the mix is bad, remix artists have a chance to redeem themselves on their dub but not Sal Parm. I really expected better mixes form him.5. Sal Parm Radio Edit (3.59): See Track 2I'd give 3 stars but the mixes were too late.$LABEL$0,1,1

slap-up book. I'm obsessed with Shaker furnitue and architecture. I'll get around to reviewing all of my books in time. I think I have every Shaker book printed!This one isn't "Complete" but there's an aweful lot in here. I look at "complete" more or less as meaning "most" variety of furniture. I didn't take it literally.This is one book that sacrifice a lot of weight to Shaker built-ins as well. Of which I'm trying to re-create so I've been referencing this book a lot lately.I do have other books, some of which focus more on details and drawings with potential variety in drawer configurations for example, others more on color and simple photos etc.So far it 's been one of my favorites in terms of the wide variety of material it contains.

"White Ladder" cypher Remarkable. Wow. It's rare to see an album rated a clean 5 stars across the board, and for that reason alone I was willing to give this record a listen. Add to that the facts that I love the song "Babylon" and that Dave Matthews, whom I respect, claims to have listened to this record almost exclusivly for months. Armed with that information, I was prepared for a record that would sit at the top of my collection for a good, long time.Ho-hum. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Perhaps it's just the hyperbolic whiplash inherent in overexpectation. Perhaps it's that David Gray writes lyrically mediocre songs then records them with undistinguished musical backing. Perhaps it's his grating voice, which works well on a single song, but annoys on an entire CD.I won't dispute the hundreds of other reviewers here and elsewhere who loved this album unquestionably. I'll just assume that I'm missing something and move on.$LABEL$0,1,1

Not indisputable about this ace.... I am new to java but not to programming, so maybe this wasn't the reserve for me. While the style is new and innovative, I eventually got worn down by the constant humor, margin notes, and off-the-wall analogies. I also get that trying to use this book as a reference was nearly impossible. When the book did have a clear answer to what I was looking for, it was buried in the same quagmire I mentioned above.I suppose that if you are completely new to writing any form of code, this may be the right book for you. I would tend to think, however, that you will quickly grow out of it, and then its use as a reference later will hardly justify the space on your shelf. As an alternative, I would suggest "Learning Java" 2nd Edition (also published by O'Reilly).$LABEL$0,1,1
Gets big with each passing minute.. Charlize Theron is a concerned wife who believes her astronaut husband (Johnny Depp) isn't quite himself after a mysterious accident in outer space. Paranoid, Roman Polanski-style thriller moves at an incredibly dense pace, rambles on predictably, and concludes with an obvious, Outer Limits-type ending.

Elegant excogitation and functional, when it process.. I recently purchased this palm for my mother who was interested in getting a new PDA. While the device itself worked perfectly, there was one major problem we seemed to have with it. The device itself seemed to stop turning on after a while. We had purchased the store's extended warranty so we just took it back and they replaced it. Second one, the same thing happened again. So we tried fiddling around with the battery, apparently the battery easily loses it's connection so the unit itself will not power on unless you fiddle with the battery. Two PDA's in a row with the same exact problem, and another reviewer encountered something similar, I think it's fair to say the initial release batch of this PDA has definitely had some issues. We ended up exchanging it for a Palm TX.My mother said she loved it while it worked, and is very disappointed such a trivial problem can cause so much annoyance.$LABEL$0,1,1

The plot is standard-issue "man falls in love with hooker with heart of gold and has to save her from the mafia" stuff.

The veridical job is.... foremost, this movie does some matter well. The introductions of most of the cast were reasonably undecomposed and the general plot began to develop quickly. As for the comic relief parts, some of the one-liners in this movies are expert than the one-liners I've heard in most movies.The main problem this movie has is, once the main premise, ants attacking humans in an office building, is underway... the threat level never increases. As you'd expect, the body count rises, but in this movie, that is usually the result of the victim's actions.I think the writers should have spent more time trying to decide what actually happens when ants start attacking people. Aside from that, the only problem is that a central character debuts far too close to the end of the movie.It does have its good points, but ultimately, the main elements of the plot could have been handled better.$LABEL$0,1,1

simple-minded yet enjoyable stories of revenge.... Cornell Woolrich is one of those 1940s writers who pumped out loads of pulp fiction that have by now largely gone out of print. He was a very good storyteller but only an average writer - that is, his prose and characterizations are not particularly good. 'The Bride Wore Black' fits this rule completely.In 'The Bride Wore Black' we have essentially five different murder stories with one seemingly common element: the same murderess. In the end we understand a bit more about her motive and why these victims were chosen. Woolrich also delivers a delicious surprise ending. Don't expect any subplots or side romances. This is pure, simple reading enjoyment that doesn't tax the brain but keeps your eyes glued to the pages.Bottom line: certainly among Woolrich's better books. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,1,0

tremendous.. It amazes me that for all of his pomp and "patriotism," Mr. Hannity cannot see that by eliminating liberalism (which he classifies as part of the "evil" we must be delivered from) he is advocating a Republic form of government. Unlike Sean, I believe it's ok for people to have different opinions -- one of them crazy "liberal" ideas -- but for someone who claims his love for America with such fervency, it's ironic that he so clearly resents the most integral aspect of democracy: more than one voice. He equates 50% of the American population as on par with terrorists at worst, as opposition at best...I would argue that someone who loves and understands this country knows that the left and right are part of a system of checks and balances created in order to avoid one party having absolute power -- not enemies with clearly defined agendas of good and evil.$LABEL$0,1,1

Went online to civic forums and they said the blue wire that my car already came with was the tach wire. Installation was so easy, took about 20 mins, I thought I did somethign wrong.

At the same time, I keep believing that if I stick it out a little longer, I will find it more compelling and that I might miss out on a good book if I give up. My philosophy has always been that I would rather walk away from a book I'm not enjoying or gaining anything from in favor of others that I would find more satisfying. With this one, I'm very torn.

flop on sentence. The Timex Travel Alarm Clock works great. It's pretty small and compact but not too tiny where you can't see anything. The ringer is loud enough and the time is fairly easy to read. The only downside is it does not have an LED back light to light up the time. Instead when you push the light button it shoots a tiny light onto the screen. Kind of a trippy set up but it works alright. iodine recommend it if you just need a basic alarm clock to wake you up.$LABEL$1,1,0
scourge of Time.... This is the world-class Dunwich book I've ever read, and I'm not sure I'll be picking up another one. My main problem with this book is the bibliography.

disappointment equate to the initiatory two. I totally fit with "Barry" a former referee who nail this on the head. The master Carol and Mike Brady actors from the first two film salve this from dip like a star shriek. The girl who plays Marcia is good, Jan hunky-dory, but the other children are completely mis-cast. The actor who plays Greg acts and expect more like Peter. Peter and Bobby simply share no resemblance to the true characters and have few cameos because of it. I thought the first part of the movie was confused and strained. Better plots are available. Some of the original series plots are brought forth, but never really captitalized on, except for the "slumber party" which was well done. This attempts to be as funny and comedic as the first two films, but fall short in depth and cleverness. Fans will want to see it...but take my advice and rent.$LABEL$0,1,1
A Cute piddling Inspirational Movie. I do totally agree that its about time somebody made a movie about marching band. All these cheesy teen movies about high school football stars drive me insane. There was some good stuff in it.... while I didn't feel it was all completely realistic, that didn't necessarily take anything away from the movie. although I must say, if you found this movie to be the least bit interesting or entertaining, you should definitely check out Drum Corps International (DCI). If your not into paying 98 bucks for the finals dvd, PBS is broadcasting a show about finals in most states right now, and it should be in the rest by thanksgiving.

So when we went to buy a new coffee maker i insisted on this one to match my kitchen, even though my husband thought it was too expensive.

He finally agreed. this worked great for about 2 years and then i got an error3 message on the computer screen of the pot. I turned it off and on like the manual said to do. then i got a new error message, error2. according to the manual that meant the computer was shot in the coffee pot. I couldn't believe it.

helium conk out on a high billet.. I enjoy these two saucer for much of the same reasons that I prefer Billie Holiday's later music. Sure, both of their voices had lost what range they had once possessed. Yes, their voices cracked and were off key much of the time; victims of the addictions which eventually claimed both of their lives. But comparable Billie, Chet Baker's voice developed an emotional level which often border on the scary. Just heed to him on the two versions of "My Funny Valentine" presented here, and see if you don't find yourself wiping away a few tears. Mr. Baker's trumpet playing, however, never seemed to fall victim to his addictions. If anything, its beauty only continued to bloom. The concert presented here was recorded only 2 weeks before the artists death and features the wonderful NDR Big Band and Radio Orchestra Hanover. For the pure emotional impact of the music, I highly recommend these discs.$LABEL$1,1,0

tough, Offensive Film. Stylistically this film was interesting. HOWEVER. This film is seriously problematic in its portrayal of a trans woman. I didn't even buy that Veronica was trans. Her identity seemed based around clothing and surgery as opposed to an actual gender identity. One reviewer talks about this being an accurate portrayal of a trans woman or representative of the trans experience? As someone who is trans and has many trans* friends, I have to strongly disagree. This film manages to slay every unrealistic stereotype about trans women. I wonder if anyone involved in the making of this film was even queer.$LABEL$0,1,1

Best Lord of the Rings lame. Everyone who played the Two Towers yearned for 2 player longer levels and more characters, and EA happily responded. First the graphics are pretty darn good, except the in-game characters' mouths don't move, but that's my only nitpick with the graphics. The sound is spectacular, exactly from the movies, which is pretty cool, and the voice acting is great with the actors from the trilogy lending their voices(watch "Hobbits on gaming." It's downright hilarious!). Controls are precisely lifted from The Two Towers, not that it's a bad thing. My only complaint with this is that even with 15 levels, it's a tad too short, enemies can stop your combos way too easily, game can get intense and hard, even on the easy difficulty. But they're only minor complaints. If you're a fan of the movies or books, you owe it to yourself to pick up The Return of the King. You won't be dissapointed.$LABEL$1,1,0

Still, it's a sound account with a logical plot and a significant message.

Her natural ability provides a good outline, but her lack of knowledge in the art of telling a good story well proves to be a crippling flaw. In an interview with Mrs. Roby, she proudly said she had never attended a writing course or worked with a writing group.

Good level-headed, piteous build quality. I've been a Fender fan but recently purchased a Les Paul Studio Deluxe and love it. I like the shorter scale and wanted a less expensive guitar to haul around. I thought this was a great mess - an American made Gibson for $500. But the build quality is so poor I'm considering a issue. The fret edges are crisp, and the pickups aren't even installed properly. They're wrapped in shoddy electrical tape and just kind of stuck in there. They move around a lot. It sounds OK, but the pickup selector seems very cheap too, and I'm worried it won't last. I don't mind the cosmetics much - stripped down to bare bones. But it looks like it's just thrown together with absolutely no concern for quality. It's the poorest assembly I've seen on any guitar at any price - except maybe those $100 kits you see in music stores. Not recommended. Try an Epiphone maybe.$LABEL$0,1,1

Not only is it so funny you laugh out tawdry, but the scenes with the serial killer are so scary that I had to stop reading to make sure the doors were locked!This is a fast-paced and funny book, and I'm looking forward to the second book in the series. Jack Daniels is a great character.$LABEL$1,1,0
fearsome. This is one of the whip CD I have ever bought. There is nothing here to distinguish it from other radius&b albums. It's cookie-cutter hip hop at its absolute uncollectible. If you lack to try the vocal "saint", then download the call and don't dissipation your money on this cadmium.$LABEL$0,1,1
dandy Car prat, but very laborious to tighten!!. ane am actually happy with this car seat and my 2 year old loves it as advantageously!! I corrupt this car invest in memory. I went in with another car seat in mind, but after talking to the sales man, who is a car seat inspector, he recommended this car hindquarters to me. He said that this car bottom is the only car seat that he recommends buying (at least the ones in store) that were a car seat/booster combo. This one was the only one that had the EPS (the stuff found in bike helmets). He said that it could be life saving in a side inpact accident.The only problem that I have with this car seat is that it is very hard to tighten. I pull the strap with all of my might and it feels like it is not going anywhere. It takes a while for me to tighten the straps everytime he gets in the car seat.If the straps were easier to tighten, then I would give it 5 stars!$LABEL$1,1,0
CD is bully, PBS show was great, look onwards to DVD. As a friend of the Marsalis family for 24 years and the President of Basin Street Records (where drummer and youngest son Jason Marsalis has recorded two wonderful CDs, Music in Motion, and Year of the Drummer) I have seen members of the family in all sorts of configurations.Those of you in the dozen cities or so where the family will be performing this month and next should make sure you go out and curb them out. Individually they are all great musicians...together they push each other to the top and have a lot of fun doing it.The CD is great, the PBS special last night was fun to watch and I am looking forward to the DVD.$LABEL$1,1,0
A true reason why they were on sale. Bought these the day after Thanksgiving sale on Amazon for a great price of 30 dollars in comparison to the original price of over 130 dollars. Got headphones and was not impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. Very humbled bass and as it is noise cancelling, it also acts as a mini-speaker since it protects so loudly when off the ears. Also within 7 days, the right phone kibosh working and I had to send off to Sony Service Center to get fixed. The good thing is that that was a very fast turnaround. Final thought, dont purchase if you are a true audiophile as you will be disappointed, even at the discounted price of 30 dollars. I have had 10 headphones I was happier with.$LABEL$0,1,1
51025 light bespeak. When stressful to supersede xenon bulb, the metal liaison on the game of the fateful electronics board (the actual place where the light bulb plugs into) broke off and now the loose is a flier. I have looked for a replacement part and have been unable to find one.$LABEL$0,1,1
slap-up reference book.. This is a great english dictionary. The paid $48 edition includes appendixes. The free one on kindle for pc only includes the dictionary A to Z. I like the encyclopedic information under some entries. On my Kindle 2 there seems to be a formatting error at locations 801955-801964. At the start of appendix 1 countries of the world, some of the data looks messed up. Data for some of the countries is missing while other country data is repeated twice. But it looks correct on my kindle for pc. There are no formatting problems with this on kindle for pc.$LABEL$1,1,0

An charge experience. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud while reading. Michael Tenaglia is one shady writer. The warning on the cover was not true I was not offened by the sex or th violence.The bigest thing I came away with was a desire/fantasy to meet the writer for a late night drink. I mean one minute you're in the middle of a fistfight on a Manhattan street, the next minute your hearing a political rant that would make Dennis Miller jealous, and the next minute he says something so poetic you're stopped in your tracks. Somehow he makes you laugh through it all. Bravo!$LABEL$1,1,0
evenhandedly serious, But admit Factual fault. I am only doing the pediatric section so far, but have distinguish factual errors. For example, question 155 in the pediatric section: An infectious process that could cause meningitis would have which sign? You have to choose between headache and stiff neck, but either one of these could indicate meningitis. Consider question 205, which suggests that lymphocytic thyroiditis is temporary. No, only the subacute form is temporary, but they left out the word "subacute" -- otherwise it would be chronic, Hashimoto's disease.Another problem with the book is that the pages come out easily, with only slight pressure.But most of these NCLEX books do contain a lot of factual errors. I feel like they should hire me as an editor; the so-called editors for most of these books must be whiskey drinkers.It's a decent book, compared to the others. Not the best, but in the mid-range. I would buy it again, but double-check the answers to make sure they're correct.$LABEL$0,1,1
No where penny-pinching as skilful as the real shows. The real display of this were far better. This is a butchered, sanitised, underdone version despite the DVD claiming to be 20 minutes longer. Many of the performances are no where as hefty as prior feat and some content is ignore down to small portions of the prior pieces heard on DEMOCRACY NOW and found on YOUTUBE. Kilcher's reading of Chief Joseph is slay on this DVD for a better version see the link on my website [...] links to a youtube from Sundance 2009.There are huge topics watered down or omitted by this presentation. Where is Haymarket ? Where is Alexander Berkman? Why is Ellsberg included ? So many other thoughts ran through my head watching this. Go to youtube watch Sandra Oh's performance of Emma Goldman on Patriotism so much more powerful than what seems like a rehearsal take on this DVD.$LABEL$0,1,1
Plain, Simple, slow. This book is sate with information. Information that is mainly useless. I usually read 60 pages a day reading about wine, but I always dreaded having to read 10 pages a day from this book. Everything is reprize over and over again. There is no pronunciation guide, so if you see an unusual word that you do not know how to say, you'll feel like your losing ground by not saying it right. The the main maps of Australia and New Zealand are somewhat decent, but the maps that they give for each region, for each chapter or section, are so detailed that there is no way you can reference where about they are in that specific region. Meaning they zoomed into roads, not cities (unlike French and Italian Wines for Dummies). To cut to the chase, the only positive thing I could come up with about this book, is that it is a rather large book and it would look good in your wine book shelf to impress friends. :)$LABEL$0,1,1
passably salutary. When I started reading this book I thought it was going to be another epic story but it turned out to be middling good. I like the way that Flewelling draws her world and the history behind it. Some of the characters such as Nysander and Alec are a bit predictable but I have hopes that the characters will develop through the trilogy.Flewelling keeps dropping hits about Seregil's past and we just want to learn more about it, doesn't always work for me, but it did this time.All in all a good and fun read.$LABEL$1,1,0
soda Confection idol. Of all the Beatle sound-alike artists I have ever heard, these guys withdraw the cake. unity could swear that's John Lennon on lead vocals and the melodies to "Vegetable Row", "Homefront Cameo" and "My Before And After" would make McCartney proud. This album plays like the missing link between Rubber Soul and Revolver. The band never really transcends their Beatle influence/obsession which is o.green with me. That's what we have Oasis for.$LABEL$1,1,0

The legendary Slowhand. Although I prefer Clapton's earlier guitar driven works like "Stepping Out", "Hideaway", "Have You Heard" from the legendary "Beano" album and "Crossroads" from Cream, this album was what would become a maltreat stone to his more laid-back experimental works like the classic "Slowhand" album. My preferent tracks included self-aggrandizing Bill Bronzy's "Key to th Highway" and Jimmie Cox's "Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out". A supreme transformation, true to Clapton's innovative improvisation. I was a bit dissapointed that "Blues Power" was not in the album but it won't do justice to the album if it did since this is a love album. This is an album for circa 70s Clapton's fan. An ultra-supreme album, well-deserved to be a classic of its genre and era.$LABEL$1,1,0
abominable, detestable, detestable!. I had such high outlook for this al-Qur'an, i am so discomfited. one very didn't care anything about it. one take some rattling glowing reviews and was so shake to rule a Book that seemed care it was something iodine would passion.I didn't caution for the writing, the mystery, the fibre, or the supposed fuck worry or coquette luck of the tale. Indiana fact unity believe the whole story was ridiculous. And the repetition of the word odious was very annoying.I so wished this had been something like Kate Ross's Julian Kestrel Mysteries which I loved. Sadly it was not at all like that and I wasn't able to find anything to love about this one.$LABEL$0,1,1
