Simply Hilarious!!!!!!!!. This is one of the best collections of children's poetry I have come across (and I consider myself a connoisseur). These poems are hilarious- sometimes didactic, sometimes fanciful and absurd-- they all appeal to the humorous sensibilities of children (and adults). This has worked for me as an extremely successful present on many an occasion- highly recommended!!!$LABEL$1,0,-100

This Is Not Metal Or Even Rock. Hearing that Led Zeppelin was a heavy metal band,(and I am a huge metal fan), I decided to buy this album since I had heard it was pretty good.Well it stinks.Not anywhere on this lousy album is not even the slightest hint of metal. Actually The Beatles get heavier than this. Dy'er Maker is so un-heavy it should be included with Frank Sinatra. Only if you are a pop fan should you buy this album, so metalheads and headbangers, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$0,0,-100

It works for me!. Super convenient that I got three for the price of one. It takes a bit to heat up (not that I really need it to be all that hot) and there isn't an on/off switch; which I actually like since I can just plug it in, do something else (like change my clothes or whatever) then come back to work on my hair. I have curly/wavy hair so holding a curl isn't a problem at all. All I need the iron to do is to smooth out my existing curls and to shape them better, the iron does just that.I've read a lot of bad reviews on this product. Usually, curling irons that work for people with straight hair never seem to work for my hair. So maybe this iron is the opposite of the usual. Maybe it just works better for wavy/curly type of hair.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Bravo Mr. Iyer!. I read this book many years ago when Cuba wasn't so much in the news and I must say that I have only the fondest memories of reading this passion packed novel. I felt every emotion whether happy or sad that the protagonists felt. It is a wonderful book that provides an accurate not exaggerated insight of how Cubans really live in Castro's Cuba. If you love the Cuban culture, its music and people, I recommend you read this novel. It will transport you to la Habana in seconds and it may even help you better understand the very sad and depressing Cuban phlight.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great and practical book. The book is very practical for advanced programmers. Definitely, it's not for beginners.Although the book was published in 2005, most guidelines are applicable today. However, some others are outdated (pictures of old versions of Visual Studio, some settings have changed in recent versions of VS, newer languages and .Net frameworks are obviously not covered here).The book deserves a careful reading; it will help any coder develop quality, maintainable code.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A Meditation for Living Right Daily. I found this book while looking for some history in thekind of meditation books for recovering alcoholics. Peoplewho have proved that their lives have changed miraculouslyby the practice of principles and living on spiritual basis.This little book is amazing. Just a few lines of encouragementeach day. Spirituality is indeed a feeding of the mind on thewholeness and beauty that comes from God. Many basic principleslearned here add peace to my life. The combination of scriptureswith little commentary is especially good for those of us lookingto feed ourselves spiritually in a short time - on the run.Sometimes you can find a real gem. This book is so simply butedifying and uplifting. To meditate on my heavly Father (fromwhom all blessings flow). Use it. I'm thankful I found it.My husband didn't read much scripture -- but he does read thislittle book.!! Thanks to the Author!!Linda$LABEL$1,0,-100

Fox-Franzen Connection. Having just finished "The Corrections" and "Strong Motion", I listened to Jonathan Franzen's interview on NPR and notched up the volume when he was asked to cite his favorite works of fiction. With utmost trust in his recommendations, I then immediately acquired both of them -Fox's "Desparate Characters" and Christina Stead's "The Man Who Loved Children." "Desparate Characters" is indeed an artfully crafted, exquisitely written novella, and would make an equally artful film or stage play if Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey agreed to work together again as Sophie and Otto. Franzen's worshipful preface, however, embarrassed me for him. Perhaps that's just his way. Ms. Fox's influence on his writing is evident throughout his work and I thank him for helping me discover her voice. My teenage son discovered her voice several years ago, when he read "The Slave Dancer", so readers with adolescent children might want to point them in her direction.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The book is not the best!. It is not the best book I have read. It was really weird and freaky. The thing about it was that I didn't comprehend it much. It was really a book that doesn't suit me that much. I didn't understand it much. At times, I felt stupid reading it because I didn't understand it. If you are a person who likes reading books about fire, this book is for you.I really don't want to have to read it again and I didn't like it. It was way out of my league. I didn't care for the Ray Bradbury. But, I am not saying I hate him. I am sayinh I might tru some of his other books as well as this book that I didn't like.

Good Basic Overview, Not Current with Today's IP Technology. I expected the 2006 fourth edition to be more up to date with today's IP satellite technology. While the networking chapter discusses IP, it is in the contex of ATM and TDM technology with little or no information on current IP topologies and satellite Internet IP services like Hughes and BGAN among others. Additionally, there is no mention of current DVB-S or S2 technology which is widely deployed today.

Another Great Bruder Toy. Everything works about this set. All the parts on the loader operate smoothly and easily. The details are appropriate for the price and the intended purpose -- play -- of the set. My three year old has great fun switching out the attachments.

LIGHTS ! CAMERA ! INSIGHT !. I always dismissed Orwell as someone who wrote a great book ("Animal Farm") and who otherwise "showed no leg".Wrong.The "Essays" sits like a seeming cinderblock on my nightstand, but gets nibbled at each and every night, at precisely the time when it would be so easy for me to simply go to sleep. Demonstrably, he writes well, for I do not go to sleep.Orwell is a master of the English language and of reasoned discourse. His politics are not MY politics, but who cares ? His well-written essays bid me forgive everything. Besides, there are more than a thousand pages of his "stuff" right here at my fingertips, so how could I possibly go to sleep?Thanks, George.

DECEPTION: The Album. I have been a great fan of Wayne Hussey, and Craig Adams since the days when they ruled the goth world with Andrew Eldrich in The Sisters of Mercy. When they departed the S.O.M and formed The Mission, their first LP First Chapter was great. Gods Own Medicine which was the follow up album was a masterpiece in my judgement. The albums that followed "Children" & "Carved in Sand" were good. Then Simon Hinckler left the band and everything that followed was a disaster. The indie release The Mask was treacherous to listen to, and much to my sadness after listening to Resurrection, I can only think back to the days of past, when The Mission UK, ruled the world.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Reliable mechanism, but not durable. I've gone through quite a supply of breakaway collars for my cats, so I've had a chance to practically evaluate several major brands, this one included. This collar features a broad ovoid tab as the latching mechanism, and it's just hands above the snap latches on other collars. Unfortunately, the reflective material, which to me is as much a safety requirement at a reliable latch, quickly faded and the adhesive holding the reflective fabric fails, rendering the nice and otherwise durable collar ineffective within a few months. When new, the reflective material was easily bright enough to spot a kitty in the dark at a 100 yards with a single bulb AA LED flashlight, so no problem being visible in car headlights. Without the same reflective material, the cat is invisible under the same conditions. The snug latch releases easily when torqued from the side as it would when caught on a passing object or brush. This would be a 5 star review if the product were durable.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Very disappointing. After years of using a 10/100 hub I decided to "upgrade" to a switch. Expecting a good product from Linksys, especially since they were acquired by Cisco, I purchased the SD208 8-port 10/100 switch. I put it on my network and the problems began. Any time I would attempt to transfer large volumes (1GB+) of data between two of my PC's the switch would freeze up on me and I'd have to unplug it and plug it back in to regain network connectivity.I've put old reliable hub back in place and I'm returning the Linksys back to Amazon.

great gift - surprisingly interesting!. I gave this book to my husband, at his request. He's an engineer, so I figured that this would be a book that interested similar minds. :) It turns out to be really facinating - our extended family and friends have enjoyed sharing it, and the photos are beautiful and interesting for all ages. My only wish is that it still was easy to find in hardback, as I think that would be nice.The book is written "story-style," which makes the information a lot more palatable to those who don't have a geology background. The historical and environmental perspectives are woven together with very thoughtful writing. There is a lot of data in this book, but I don't think it reads like a textbook, which is nice.Overall, this is a great book. It makes a wonderful gift for just about anyone who appreciates the environment or anyone who has an interest in understanding the land formations they see or live on.$LABEL$1,0,-100
My tub now feels like a spa!.

Inexpensive, wireless, great graphics, fun for whole family.. As always, nintendo may not be doing the whole package such as HD dvd or Blue ray, or monster HD graphics, but The 480P, wireless network, unique controlers, and low price tag make this unit a very formitable competition for the X box 360 and PS3. One thing nintendo has never left out is the whole family.

Excellent *****John Merril has done his homework.. John Merril sets up three portfolios,each holding stocks bonds and cash.He takes the reader thru every bull and bear market from 1926 thru 1997. Many authors of investment books avoid the investment history of the 1930s and other prolonged bear markets but Merril wants the reader to realize the risk and the reward that comes whith investing.I would urge anyone who has a 401k plan or Ira to purchase this book. Mr.Merril may have some different views then others when it comes to indexing and foreign investing but explains his views honestly.This is a great book and I don`t know why since it`s published over a year ago that no one has reviewed it.This is a book that should be updated every year.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Why was this supposed to be a masterpiece??.

Vocals on some tracks are just hideously recorded... did they just take the demo scratch vocals & then built everything else around it?Unfortunately most of the stuff sounds dated and at the most sounds like an interesting demo.

I own most of his releases and have been at many of his concerts since the 1980's - most recently his solo accoustic.For several years, I have been hoping for another accoustic Neil Young release. My wish came true with Silver & Gold. If you like Neil's accoustic style sound, you'll love this release. It is so soothing with intelligent, thoughtful lyrics. Think about this - with this release, this artist has had major hits in 5 decades (60's, 70's, 80's, 90's and now, 2000. Incredible.

Volume "blues" keeps this little guy from being a rock star.. Some reviews on this device allude to the volume not being loud enough. After owning it for a month, I agree whole heartily.

I have the much larger Zen and although I dig the reduced size of the 512TXFM, I honestly miss the volume of the Zen.

So, what I have been doing is uploading my tunes and then during playback I find the ones that are really low in volume(most 70's stuff) and then go in take it out, MP3gain it, put it back in......bummer..Otherwise, this is a great little product and well worth the $$$$LABEL$1,0,-100

What else would expect for a K-body - 5 stars. If you are looking at Bessey K-Bodys, you already know how good a quality of clamp these are. I've been using the four I purchased for about a month now and have experience absolutely no issues. These 24's are perfect for edge gluing and I've made some pretty nice raised panel blanks using them.Amazon can do a better job packaging the clamps for shipping, but that is an Amazon issue, not a Bessey Issue.$LABEL$1,0,-100
awesome minus one. I saw this musical at the Dominion Theatre in the West End and it was truly amazing, unlike any musical I've been to before. The audience was rocking out, waving glowsticks, clapping, and singing along by the time the cast sang "Bohemian Rhapsody" at the end. The soundtrack perfectly captures the fun of the show, and I recommend it wholeheartedly. The only downside is that "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" is omitted, quite strangely given its prominence in the show and its popularity in general. Still, the CD is entirely worth buying AND the show is definitely worth seeing if you get the chance.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Bad acting. The movie was very boring. Mostly, because of SJ Parker. She can't act. She was so fake that I hardly made myself to finish watching it.

The Bean Trees. Taylor Greer encounters many obstacles in her journey headed to nowhere. She leaves her hometown looking to start a new, when a lady puts a child in the front seat of her Volkswagen and walks off. Taylor has no choice, but to take care of the child at least for a little while. But Taylor ends up loving the child more and more each day. Along her journey she meets many interesting people; Maggie- a woman that fixes cars for a living , Lou Ann- an overprotective mother and Mrs. Parsons- an old, blind woman that babysits small children. Taylor picks up a few jobs here and there, until she meets Lou Ann and moves in with her. Taylor's mission in this book is to find the child's relative's, but she never does. That's why I gave it two stars. I don't really like how the book ends, because it leaves you wondering. This book is slow paced and easy to read, if your looking for something simple it's nice.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Back to the past. Reading the reviews and listening to the album I get confused because itis, surprisingly, just a remake of her excellent album "Dry" of... 1993! It seems that, along with U2's latest, she is getting back to her roots. If that is all she could extract musically and creatively from living in New York in the last year, then I would conclude that is a lot of hype for nothing.

Suckular at best. Luckily, my boyfriend picked this up in the $5 bin at a discount store. If he had spent anymore on this soon-to-be door stopper, I would be irate. I'd donate this to Goodwill, but it seems unfair for someone else to be duped into buying this suckular movie.I've seen and enjoyed "Wet Hot American Summer," so I thought that this film from David Wain would deliver..nope. The final scene is an absurd musical recap of the disjointed sketches. The finale just didn't work. I thought for certain that this was originally a musical/play penned by the writers, and adapted unsuccessfully into a film--I wanted desperately to think that this was not the intended product. Nope.Skip this movie. Charlton Heston's Moses made me laugh more than this wannabe religious satire.

A short well written book on Medical Aspects of Eating Disorders. This book is a gem. It is clearly written and well edited. In spite of its brevity (perhaps because of it!)it manages to pack into a neat and organized package most of the key clinical info that I need to fulfill my role as Medical Director of a Partial Hospital for E.D.s. This book helped me remember and retain (and have quickly available for cases), all the basic Medicine knowledge that is pertinent to my role; knowledge that I needed to be a Physician in the broad and well-rounded way that is necessary when treating women who are not only psychiatrically challenging, but who are often quite sick due to medical complications of their disorder.

Great headgear!. This is at least the third pair of these that my son has had. It is the only headgear that he has asked for again, before he always switched each time he needed new ones. Wore out one pair, only had to get a new one this time because his old ones had tape on them, all the wrestlers like to tape the straps and this year our state school association does not allow for any "modification" of headgear, so we bought these.

Cliche to say the least. The old VW bus they go cross country in has no gears so they have to push it to start it running (you get the idea)..

Now an old favorite. I collect breakfast cookbooks (yep, there are TONS out there!) but Marion's book has become one of my absolute faves: stained, dog-eared and notated. The Dried Fruit Cream Scones are excellent as are the Shirred Eggs, but her recipe for Pulled Bread (the easiest recipe in the world!) made me a fan for life. Many recipes have variations, and chapters consist of everything from breads to meat, as well as accompaniments including spreads and beverages and pies! Many of the recipes are ways to use up leftovers and hail from times past; don't look for new-fangled fusion cooking here, as Marion has strong opinions about not "startling" anyone that early in the morning. This is comfort food, folks, tried and true.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Absolutely Addicting!. This is one of the best buys that I've made all year. (Yes, I know it's March.) I played it for hours and hours. Sleep became secondary. In fact, the only reason I'm not playing now is because my game freezes after about 2 hours of playing. I don't know if my laptop is the problem or the disk. I'm still trying to figure it out. Other than that, the game is simply amazing. You control everything. You handle ride speeds, research and development, and garbage can placement. You have to deal with bank debts, lost guests, vandelism, crashed rides, and business quotas. I highly recommend this game. Once I finish this one, I'll probably get the new Expansion Pack.

Excellent songwriting and even better musical performances. An amazing album from the greatest Rock and Roll band in the world. Even though Little Feat has rarely gotten the recognition or praise they deserve by the rock press, they continue to get better with time.

The music runs the gamut of rock, blues and jazz played in the amalgam that is Little Feats inimitable sound.

Poor Effort with Liberal Racist Overtones. If this one of the best books that contempory fiction writers have to offer, then the TV set and old, worn-out movie plots have little competition from the literary world.

Personal view. Music appreciation is a very personal thing, and I can only express my own view, which others may disagree. The first thing is that I found Mr Watson's voice to be not that beautiful.

Waste of time!. This book tops the charts for worst book I've read in quite some time. Heavy-handed characterisation, dull plotting, lots of gratuitous violence, and bad writing to boot! I mean, how can both of the women characters (there are only two, besides the 9-year old girl in danger of being molested) be the most beautiful ever? Why do they both have - I kid you not - "chalcedony" skin? Did the writers run out of words for white? I mean if you're going to be cliche, at least you could use "alabaster" or "ivory" for variation. Oh yeah, did I mention that both of these women are rape victims - one before the book, one during the book - sadly, all too typical. Too bad, because the premise looked interesting.$LABEL$0,0,-100
RESPECT FOR HAMILTON, he is a real artist. I really enjoyed this CD from the first song to the last. His songs are REAL and I have alot of respect for his artistic talent and his sexy raspy voice.

urbane but stupendous ignorance, sold as profit. How can I take seriously an "expert" who devotes pages 5 and 6 of his book to trying to convince us that the Phoenicians invented talking? Does Mr. Urban really believe what he tells his readers - that, until a mere of thousand years ago when the Phoenicians came along, humankind communicated purely by drawing pictures and letting loose the occasional wordless grunt?It simply did not happen that way - ask any linguist, archeologist, or historianThe author of this work also misleads his readers on the origin of the word "phonics." Contrary to his assertion, it doesn't have to do with the word "Phoenician" at all. Checking "phonics" and "Phoenician" in any dictionary which gives word-origins will confirm that.I'd rather fail to communicate at all than communicate false-to-fact information, even for the vast sums that Hal Urban claims he makes from selling his inaccuracies to corporations and the general public.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A little too depressing for a Self-Help book. I read Sark I know how she guest-stars Sabrina Ward-Harrison in her books, so I looked forward to reading a copy of Sabrina's book. First off: The art is gorgeous. Really. Her collages are very personal and her effort pays off hansomly. On the other hand, the content of the book itself is pretty much a big downer. There's no resolution to any of her dillemas, just a big complaint about how she feels she has no control about her esteem-lacking life. I'm sure that if I knew her I would be feeling much different. But there isn't the payoff that comes with seeing the other side of her personality. I do hope she keeps writing (she does have promise and her art is great), but her next piece has more "arc" to it from the internally repressed to the externally liberated.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great Small Sat replacement. I purchased these because my old JBL sats. finally died after 8 years. These are excellent replacement sats. for any installation.

Excellent compilation.. I normally stay away from Greatest Hits cds because you tend to get cheated somehow. The songs are usually the radio (i.e. shortened) version of the original, or the Greatest Hits cd only includes the more widely accepted songs of the artist and exclude the gems that didn't get a lot of radio play. This Babyface Greatest Hits cd includes the original versions of the songs and even an extended live version of his song with Eric Clapton. This is a nice cd, even for those who feel Babyface is a little too "soft" for their taste. I would highly recommend it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A sad but powerful story that everyone should read. One of the best books I have ever read. Sad but extremely powerful. It is a must read for anyone, especially mothers who are having a difficult time coming to grips with the sexual orientation of their children.The book is well written and detailed. You feel a connection with Bobby and his mother through out the book. At times, the book can be a tear jerker.

Centrifugal Bumblepuppy. Matt Mahaffey, the creative force behind Self, has accomplished one of the most compelling and enjoyable albums I have ever heard. In his first outing on DreamWorks records, the band has produced a powerful and skilled recording full of catchy hooks, uncommon sampling and creatively appealing lyrics. All of this is backed up with competent instrumentation. This album just knocks the balls off of my chin and forces me to take notice. And notice I did. Not to say that the other tracks on this CD aren't anything less than outstanding, but be sure to pay close attention to "The End of it All", "It All Comes Out in the Wash" and "Placing the Blame".$LABEL$1,0,-100

This cable was poorly manufactured. I bought this cable to listen to music on my cell phone. It does not work at all when it is plugged into the earphone jack. It only works if I push and pull the male end of the plug until I find a spot where it conducts. Since it's not in the correct position, it will not lock in place and I have to use tape in order to hold it. I have tried two other similar cables to check that it wasn't the cell phone causing the problem, and they both worked perfectly. I recommend you not buy this product.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Sometimes growing up is not easy. I always enjoy Ms. Pappano's books and this is no exception. She certainly has expert touch in character studies. Ethan and Grace have a lot to over come, not only with each other but within themselves. Abuse comes in many forms and how it affects each child depends upon the individual. Ethan became wild because everyone expected him to and Grace withdrew into herself and tried to become "invisible". Good read, not just fluff. Message for all. Forgiveness would seem to be the key word...they had to forgive themselves, each other and family. Acceptance comes next. Their row to hoe will not be easy.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Mediocre at best. This book basically gives you the watered-down rehashed MSDN version of .NET socket and network programming. This is a 350 page book attempting to cover all aspects of this subject including remoting and the structure of the .NET libraries without getting into much detail in each one.A mere 18 pages is devoted to server side socket programming, but even that is packed with so much fluff that a programmer winds up with too little information to implement an regular TCP socket server, much less an asynchronous one.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Pass on this one.... I bought this gun a few months ago at Lowes. Most of my experience with this gun is with using 2" nails. I can report to all that this gun frequently mis-fires (dry fire). Also, the gun doesn't always 'reset' back into the proper firing position. DeWalt has missed the mark with this gun and I would not recommend it to anyone. In my opinion this gun should be recalled. Don't be lured by the good looks and light weight - the substance is not behing the style. Thank goodness Lowes took this product back - I told the customer service person that it's a RTV (return to vendor)...$LABEL$0,0,-100

Stick a Fork In It. I've read this series since the first installment, and unfortunately they keep getting worse.Renie, who used to be somewhat amusing, keeps getting more and more annoying. Way too much time is spent on stupidity such as her stuffed ape being "kidnapped" and her rabbit dressed in a tutu. Her mouthiness and attitude are also no longer entertaining -- the character has become unbearable. And Judith isn't much better -- people talking to her because she smiles warmly at them has long since gotten ridiculous.When you run out of feasible reasons for your characters to be involved in murder and the reasons become as convoluted and lame as they have with this series, it's time to stick a fork in it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Time travel, love and getting to change history!!. I bought this book after reading a review somewhere. When i picked it up i was like ok it is good but it did get better. It is definetly for kids 15 or younger just becuase of the way it is written. However i am 21 and i liked it.After wrecking her dad's brand new BMW, she wishs (while holding her necklace) that she was anywhere else only to transported back in time. She soon finds herself in love and wanting some soap. She eventually gets back only to find that everthing has changed because she went back in time, so she goes back again to fix what she did.

Wildly over rated!. From Brooklyn myself, there are loads of bands regurgitating simplistic, non-catchy, synth meets poor guitar work ballads about the lost and lonely artists of the world, and in this case Williamsburg.

Oh dear: what a boring life. This book could only possibly appeal to diehard ABBA fans who still want to know what made Annifrid, Benny, Bjorn and Agnetha tick. At the very least there should be some explanation for the costumes. But what Agnetha has dished is the least revealing autobiography in living memory. She retraces events familiar to any self respecting fan and ignores questions of personality, musical preference...well, just about everything that makes one want to read someone else's story. I read the book in one sitting (very easy) and haven't touched it since, despite there being some excellent photos of her and the rest of the group. If you'd like something at least a little racy I'd recommend the (probably mostly fictional) biography "The Name Of The Game", but as for "As I Am" best get on with your (probably more interesting) life.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Useful book. I found this book to present a straightforward look into the complex world of neural networks. It is ideal for someone with little or no background in the subject yet covers sophisticated techniques as well. There were plenty of diagrams and many practical examples of how to use neural networks in the "real world." The software presents some challenges, however, given it predates Windows 98 and 2000. It seems to only work with US regional settings. Nevertheless, I was able to get it up and running and enjoyed the several examples and exercises described in the book. Overall, nicely written, an excellent introduction to the subject, and a good value.$LABEL$1,0,-100
You need this!!!. For residential or commercial use, you can't go wrong. Working in the home improvement industry, my line of work is window and door installations.

Hauntingly beautiful a true work of art!. Kaitlyn ni Donovan's Cd, Songs For 'Three Days' echos of impressionistic classical music, jazz Celtic and pop. Every track held attention. I was constantly suprised at the diversness and fluidity of the music. Lots of stringed instruments, oddest being ukulele create a delicate backdrop for the CD. I'd compare ni Donovan's vocals a bit of Enya mixed with Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins and Suzanne Vega. Lacking a lyric sheet, the lyrics I could make out seemed enigmatic and personal. Excellent introspective bedtime or reading music. Kaitlyn ni Donovan's Songs for 'Three Days' could have mass appeal if it weren't too painfully an original rare find.$LABEL$1,0,-100
wannabe classic. This is just a mediocre crime novel masquerading as high literature. If you like this genre, go for established crime writers - at least they write well researched books with interesting plots. The prose is patronizing, the characters are shallow, the big bang of the beginning is an inaudible invisible whimper by page 20. The lack of research may not be obvious to an American reader, but as an Indian let me assure you that no Indian can have a name like Ray Singh (they are both last names) or Ruana Singh. I cannot believe I wasted my time reading this through to the end...with all the hype about it I felt I had to!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Canto Di Primavera. The album's title sounds somewhat like a veal entree in an Italian ristorante, the contents is quite close to it too. Some instrumental passages are reminiscent of the group's early years and suggest that the former mastery is hiding behind the mediocrity of the music.

Connelly churns out another good novel. Connelly did it again with Lost Light. His work is everything you're looking for and yet the story is unpredictable enough to keep you reading and turning the pages. Like most characters in this genre of books, Bosch's life is written out as a chronology. In this novel he's now retired and he does reflect back, if briefly, on some of the previous cases we all read about. Its an appealing element to the Bosch series in that you find yourself relating to the character, almost as if you can imagine getting to know them. If you like Connelly, you'll probably find that this is one of his best works. You can see his continued growth as a writer and his works generally continue to get better and are more polished. Connelly shows again that he's one of the most gifted writers in this genre. All in all, another great read.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good overall. I have had this product for I think about 6 months now and I still haven't had to change the filter. When I first got it, I did have to buy an attatchment from the hardware store for my faucet. My faucet is the kind that is supposed to look like an old farmhouse faucet, so it was a little small. The attachment was only around $1 so it wasn't a big deal. The filter does leak every now and then, epecially when I use hot water, but it doesn't leak enough to bother me.

awesome rock cd. I think this cd is great. I'm not a terribly big fan of hard rock but this cd is great to listen to if you feel like rocking hard. That said, I really like the track Drive because it shows that Incubus can be softer too, as well as Pardon Me for it's lyrics and awesome chorus. I guess one of the main reasons I like this cd is because it got me hooked on Incubus, now I can't wait to get my hands on their next cd. It's also good because Incubus is one of those bands that can really rock without using a lot of swear words. If you're looking for a good rock band or are just an Incubus fan I definitely recommend picking up this cd!$LABEL$1,0,-100
"There's not going to be any evacuation!". Ouch! Man, alive, this movie almost has to be seen to be believed! How Irwin Allen convinced all these stars to even look at the script is an amazing feat! If you want a medley of disaster movies, than this one is for you, others should stay away like it was the plague. The other reviewers all correct in their statements, any other Irwin Allen disaster movie or any other disaster movie should suffice. The highlight of the movie really is James Franciscus and his overblown dialogue.

irritating piece of research. Anyone doing research into the history of anaesthesia should check this out, but this should definitely not be the last or only word on the controversy. Historians tend to disagree on who should be credited with the discovery of anaesthesia in the United States: Wells or Morton. MacQuitty plants herself well within the Morton supporter's camp, oversimplifying a complex series of human interactions and relationships by dismissing Wells' role in the "discovery" (excuse the scare quotes) and adpotion of surgical anaesthesia, especially when treating ether, nitrous oxide, and cholorform as historically identical substances.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Good Equipment. I purchased this because I do alot of number punching at work and I hate using the embedded keypad on the top row of the laptop I use. The install was easy and the driver also includes a calculator software with number transfering capabilities as well. I found it useless, but it [work for] many poeple's needs. My only Gripe is that the cable comes out of it on the right hand side, if you have it on the right side of the keyboard it has to go back around to the left side. No big deal but it is just kinda quirkie and thought that I would throw that in.Other than that it is awesome, the keys respond like it is an embedded keyboard and it doesn't hog a usb port, I know some have the hub but a co-worker has one like that and the hub on it doesn't work so I figured go with the Serial port and not use the USB...

All of the songs are on the CD and you get to hear Jimmy's comments to the audience which many times make the show. But there is only about an hour of the actual concert on the DVD. I would have preferred that they tape the whole concert and sell it separately. However, in my case something is better than nothing so I would recommend this set.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Different strokes for different folks. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I happen to think that the first CD is crap and I love the second CD. It just goes to show you, don't listen to what half of these people say, Get what you want because it's what you like. The first Cd is to much trance for me to handle, the second CD was great soulful house music with a latin flavor. I enjoy most of the Knee Deep remixes and it's nice to finally have 'pasilda' on disc.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Unblack to the core!!!. This is no joke. This is the real deal for Unblack Metal. We stay true to glorifying Christ and to His Message. "Invert the Inverted Cross" says it all! This is not a rip-off of Darkthrone or any other Black Metal band. This is simply giving you the other side of the story, the TRUE side!This music is for those who have drowned themselves in the lies that Black Metal has told. This music is atmospheric and truly a classic! It existed long enough to say what needed to be said. The lyrics are extreme, just as Christianity is. You can burn our churches and kill our people, but God has the ultimate victory!Hail the Eternal Emporer, Jesus Christ!Love,Servus Dei from Offertory$LABEL$1,0,-100

Pretty . . . and Flimsy. Cool glowing lighted keyboard . . . combined with flimsy build quality and it's a gigantic waste of money.

Almost as good as No!. 'Here Come the ABCs' is a very good children's record/dvd. It is really well made and although it is made for pre-schoolers, it isn't annoying for a parent/adult.The animations and videos on the dvd are very intersting too, even though the budget for them was clearly low.It is obvioulsy made for a younger crowd than NO! was, but still, it's almost as good and entertaining for any TMBG fan.I say definitely worth buying.$LABEL$1,0,-100

8th day of christmas 2011 review. On the 8th day of christmas 2011 Im going to review...Child's Play. There are so many plotholes in this film that I can't type them all in one sitting. The acting is terrible at best. The premise is preposterous & stupid. The devices that made Chucky look like he was real are faulty at best. Worst of all,even thought the cast saids that Chucky's body is becoming more human,he can still move & LIVE without a head,with one arm and with only one leg. They to shoot it like a million times before he goes down for the count for good. Overall,while it is scary for some people,it's dated at best. I give this movie a 2 and a half out of 10.$LABEL$0,0,-100
They just keep getting better!. After seeing the show True Blood on HBO this past year I just had to know more about Sookie's world. I thought the series started a little slow with Dead Until Dark but DEFINITELY picked up with Living Dead In Dallas. Club Dead blew me away! I LOVED IT! I picked it up four days ago and finished last night. I'm already two chapters into Dead to the world. I love the development of the characters relationships. Especially Sookie and Eric.

Poor Syntax, Spelling, and Lack of a Translator. I would be careful purchasing this edition of The Master and Margarita. The lack of a translator was apparent with misspelled words (haze, spelled ha2e), poor sentence structure (often lacking a verb), and the spacing was not indicative of who was speaking.I have since gone on and purchased the edition by Picador and find it an entrancing read. I realize now how much I missed out of the first three chapter of the edition I purchased from Amazon by Classic House Publishing.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A Very Underrated Movie. I saw this movie on TV about 10 years ago while channel surfing and loved it so much I could not get it out of my head. I had to buy a used VHS tape as there is no DVD available in US.William Holden and David Niven are terrific but the best in the cast is Maggie McNamara and I wish she had done more movie work. The dialogue is witty and the story is charming.With all the trash being put on DVD it is a shame that this little gem is not. It is also fairly hard to find the tape and it is not cheap but it is worth paying a higher price for.Again, the biggest asset of this movie is Maggie McNamara and you will not get to see her in anything else of this caliber.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Loved It. Everyone that has commented seem to think the movie was awful.. Me on the other hand has never watched the Avartar Airbender cartoon.. So maybe I don't know what it should have or shouldn't have been .. But I really enjoyed the movie.. And i'm a strong movie buff of any Fantasy Movie as long as their is a story line.I actually hope their is a 2 on the horizon. And any way it was only for entertainment.. Not to build my life on.. So i give it a big thumbs up and to me the special effects was awesome.The actors did a good job on bringing to movie to life. I wasn't trying to pick the movie a part but to enjoy the movie. But then thats just my opinion. I would recommen you watching it and forming your own opinion.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not My Favorite. I love almost everything written by Georgette Heyer. And this book is one of the reasons why I say "almost"...This book is more of a Gothic-style romance, but even considering that, I found it a creepy and unpleasant read. And if you are looking for a romance novel, there is very little focus on the romance and more on the weird goings-on of possibly deranged family members.I would steer clear of this one! She has so many other great novels, don't waste your time here.I'd give it a one-star, but I just can't do that to a Heyer novel.$LABEL$0,0,-100
DON'T READ!!!!! BAD INFO!!!!!!!!!. I just want to say that i love 98 Degrees!!!! I love their music, their looks, and their down to earth attitudes. So don't get me wrong when i say i don't like this book. It has nothing to do with them. The one who wrote this book can't even get their names right. She keeps on calling Jeff....Jeff Lachey. If you are going to write a book about someone you should at least get their names right. Plus it was so chessy. One part is like Nick is sad....Nick is lonely.....He is wearing only his boxers and his tattoos. He has tons of girls numbers but no true love. He wonders if there is any yoo-hoo in the fridge. It gets annoying. Plus when she talks about the songs she gets the parts wrong of who sings what. I know everyone may not know everything about 98 but if you are going to write a book about them you should get your facts straight. Anyone go get their offical book when it comes out. Don't waste your time or money with this one!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Better to save your money. Having read Hernandez's high-powered "A is for Admissions," I was very disappointed by this product resulting from the collaboration of two seeming experts. Each page contains one advice, with only a few sentences of explanation, so the content of the book could've easily been compacted into fewer pages. Also, the advice seems to be a downgrade compared to those offered in Hernandez's other book; some are rehashed, while others non-brainers. Save your money and time by avoiding this book.

HP1209 = JUNK. The FUNCTIONS of this printer/copier/scanner are AWESOME, but the QUALITY is absolute GARBAGE. For about the first 6 months, this printer would handle envelope printing reasonably well, but after that printing envelopes is essentially impossible. The printer usually destroys 3-4 envelopes before it gets one that is marginally acceptable. Additionally frustrating is that - like many HP printers - there is no reasonable way to extract paper jams. Also, the software that comes with the printer is NOT user-friendly. Finally, after recently re-installing Windows XP, the HP driver software (unnecessarily) re-installs the printer drivers EVERY time the computer boots up; sometimes it re-installs the printer drivers at random times. This is VERY FRUSTRATING.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Two Damfools (three, counting moi). I remember the afternoon in 1968 when I walked into downtown New Haven's Merle's Record Rack and was shown with great furtiveness a NEW John Lennon LP that was being kept UNDER the counter. It was literally encased in a brown paper slipcover that revealed only John's and Yoko's b&w; faces.As if being let in on a big conspiracy, I was told that the Beatle and his wife were totally naked on the cover: frontal nudity and rear nakedness on the LP sleeve's flip. So, like a dummy I laid out good money for what is TOTAL GARBAGE.Noise. Junk. Offal. Piffle. You pick the negatory noun.The photos are ugly. The recordings are uglier. This is the barrel bottom of Sixties crapola, and that's coming from a devoted John Lennon fan.Please don't make the same mistake I did way back when.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Brainless, Shallow, and Absolutely Hilarious. This film is from the same wackos who gave us Airplane, Police Academy, and Naked Gun. If you've seen even just one of these, you pretty much know what to expect from this one. Except for one thing: for sheer mindless fun, Top Secret tops them all.The movie stars a young (and apparently not very role-choosy) Val Kilmer as a teen rock n' roll idol who goes on a road tour in East Germany, where he meets and falls in love with Hilary (Lucy Gutteridge), who enlists his aid to rescue her scientist father.But really, who cares about the plot? Watch this show for the deliciously insane gags. I won't even mention a single one of them, because they have to be seen to be believed.Sure, the humor is unsophisticated. Even dumb. But that's the point. We all have to treat ourselves to this sort of lunacy now and then. And I'd have to say that Top Secret is the best way to do just that.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Well Crafted Lyrics. Listen to "Yummy Down on This". Ignoring the song's perverted subject matter, you have to admit that the lyrics were very intelligently crafted. Jimmy Pop obviously spent a good deal of time getting these lyrics to flow smoothly, often with several different levels of meaning. The other songs on this album have many of the same characteristics.Guys may tend to relate to some of the songs more than the gals. In fact, most women will probably find songs like "A Lap Dance Is So Much Better When The Stripper Is Crying" offensive. Come to think of it, this song manages to press almost every offensive button imaginable.The bottom line: This album is very vulgar and perverted, BUT contains lyrics that are much more complex (hidden meanings and subtle humor) than most rap albums out today.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The MM275 is cheap and flimsy. I bought the Black And Decker MM275 based only on an Amazon recommendation. Within minutes of using this lawn mower I knew that my purchase of the MM275 was a mistake.Cons:* The bar height is not adjustable. I'm 5'11", and the bar is below my waist, which is uncomfortable.* The power switch is mushy soft plastic, like a chew toy for a dog. This essential part feels like it will break within a year, and reviews of similar Black And Decker lawn mowers say that it does.* The power connector doesn't have a lock or clip, so the power cord falls out. You'll need to tape or glue the power cord to the switch housing.* The motor is under-powered. I had to mow my lawn twice to get an even cut.* The shroud has a big nose. You can't do edges with this mower.Pros:* Very light. You can mow with one hand.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Works great and easy to install. This is such a great addition to the 14 inch Jet bandsaw that I'm surprised Jet doesn't just make it standard on all their 14 inch saws. I was able to install it by myself, and I'm an old guy. I rigged a rope from the ceiling to support the top arm of the saw, disconnected the bolt, and lowered it to the floor. After that, the installation goes very easy and straightforward. Putting the top arm back on was the opposite of taking it off, but be sure that you can tie off the rope so you can use both hands to tighten the bolt.The only negative is the blade that ships with the riser block - it's not very good. Buy yourself a selection of Timber Wolf blades to use for resawing.Having the extra resaw capability if really nice and increases the usefulness of the saw. I recommend this accessory.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Granted, getting stuck in a blizzard on Mt Everest isn't what most people would describe as lucky; however, he sure has profitted fom writing Into The Wild and Into Thin Air.

THIS IS A CHILDREN'S BOOK. I like to think I have read a lot of books in my day, and the most important thing to keep in mind when reading something is know the context of what is being written, make no mistake, this book was written for people too immature to read Harry Potter. The plot and characters are underdeveloped. The whole thing is a huge Tolkien ripoff (but so is most Fantasy). This book is for first time fantasy readers who are 8 to 12. But before reading this i would recomend reading Harry Potter and the Wheel Of Time so you have and idea of what good Fantasy is.i will admit it was entertaining but anyone who gives this 5 stars needs to read a Game of Thrones by George RR Martin and know what quality fantasy is. This is not quality, it is some kid trying to scrape money together to pay for college and taking the easy way out without making his book worth reading.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Questionable benefit. I am unsure of the benefit of using this CD lens cleaner. It MAY have solved the problem of a dirty/dusty lens, but it may not have, as the problem on one CD player was only temporarily resolved. Another CD player that otherwise worked fine could not recognize this disc at all, and on all of my players that did, it could not advance to the third track, which contains only music. Significant skipping was noticed on all CD players, including those that never skip on other discs. If nothing else, this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix, but if your CD player's lens needs cleaning, there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problem.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Character studies in surburbia. Frank and April Wheeler on the outside are the "perfect couple" living in suburban Connecticut with their two children. Behind closed doors, though, April is a failed actress (that she is played in the film version by the terrific Kate Winslet is ironic) and Frank endures the drudgery of a 9-to-5 job. Planning to move to Paris and fulfill their expectations of greatness, Frank and April's shared life shatters with revelations of infidelity and broken promises. A lot of people pretend to be something they're not; this isn't new, but Richard Yates brings a fresh look to 1950s hopefulness and optimism in his dark look at marriage and coupledom.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not too Durable. I used the beanbag mount for the Garmin iQue product. When I purchased the C550, I tried the suction cup mount but I could never get it to stick to the windshield for more than a few days. I purchased the Garmin Dashboard mount and it lasted three weeks, or until the first really hot day. The car is kept garaged during the day and at night so it was only one day of heavy sunshine needed to separate the base from the dashboard. I wound up with the C550 in my lap at 60 mph.I can't recommend this product to anyone due to safety concerns. If the glue had separated during a tight turn, it could have resulted in an accident.For now, I'm going back to the beanbag mount but I'll give careful consideration to a factory-installed GPS in my next car.Bob$LABEL$0,0,-100
a good one but not great.. Teh first three free cd's are filled with alot of hard blues rockin and ballads. The feel here is more laid back , and this is close in some ways to 'free at last' but this isn't a bad cd at all. It has many bonus tracks and the sound is excellent. The music though is good , but not standout , and even if he cover had said 'free' highway instead of just highway" , I don't think that this would have been a big hit. It would have sold more though than it did. This is good cd it's just not as powerful as 'heartbreaker' or 'tons of sobs' or 'free'. The songs are good guitar driven songs but they are mostly mellow. And that's good too. It's a good mellow rock cd mostly. So if you like mellow rock and laid back songs with a few rockers then this one is for you.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Sexual braggadocio from a smart, conceited Italian. Alberto Bevilacqua is an accomplished novelist and, I now know, quite the man about town. This book is all about the women he's known, about how exquisitely sensitive he was and is to them; about men, his friends, and his life. It's full of bragging and posturing. He is pretty good at describing sexual acts, bodies, and female orgasm, but one of those orgasms -- fantastic, never-to-be-forgotten -- he believes he incited in one of the women he writes about was less impressive -- to this reader -- than he intended. (What if she was faking?) I liked his memories of his very young adolescence. This book was adored in Italy but I would guess that they saw right through it in France.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A space opera reminiscent of star wars. An easy read that will make you feel good, but not very challenged. There is usually little doubt as to what will happen next, but the characters are interesting at times (even if they are somewhat cariacatured). The warlike Barryarans and peacenik Betans don't display much variety, but the character of Miles Vorkosigan is interesting to read in action. Lois Bujold gets better with her later novels about this strange universe set in a future where humans migrated to the stars as tribes and lost touch with each other for a time and then found each other again. The Barrayarans appear to be made to resemble the Soviets (warlike and totalitarian), while the Betans are Anglo-American democratic pacifists. All in all Bujold is a good writer (as she proves with some later adventures starring Miles), but here she appears to be experimenting and growing still. Not bad and not the best, but it's a better read than most other science fiction out there.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A truly magical album. I can still remember the feeling of electric delight that went through me when I first heard this album. While cynics can dismiss it as derivative, obnoxious, mindless frat-rock, I feel like they're missing out. This album is the most visceral expression of joy I have ever heard. It's triumphant, vibrant and elating. Exploding with hedonistic zeal, this is an album about being alive and present in the purest sense. Whether one enjoys it ironically or sincerely, the feeling is the same: delighting, uplifting and intoxicating. And in case anyone is wondering, I'm being dead serious.$LABEL$1,0,-100

T-fal Iron. In the short time that I have been using the T-fal iron, I have been impressed with the smoothness of the soleplate, as well as the Easycord System. If there is a problem, it is in the instruction manual, which I found somewhat confusing. Actually, the manual makes the iron seem more complicated than it is. However, the Manual should be consulted in depth prior to use of the iron, and its precautions adhered to.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Getting rid of this toy today. My baby received this toy as a gift, even though it's a good looking toy, I am concern about my baby's safety, He doesn't walk yet, so I used it in the sitting mode, today my baby was riding it and he tried to reach the front toys, in a flash the car roll over itself getting upside down, my baby's forehead went straight to the floor, thanks God our floor is carpeted and he was far away from furniture. If it wasn't for the carpet my son would have a big bump on his head. I was happy with this toy before this happened but I am not let my baby to play with it anymore.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great Fuzz buster!. This detector has saved me already a few times on the highway. I purchased it because I used to drive a sluggish SUV, and now find my self driving a new sports coup far faster than I am used to. To be on the safe side, I got this to be precautionary. The distance it can detect in a straight line is great. I do have questions about how well it can detect from behind but so far so good. I do like the blue lights that go off to alert you, but they will make you jumpy when driving at night on the highway and they go off like a cop is already on your tail. Great for price and like the City mode that mutes false alerts.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointed as well,. I have been trying to concieve 13 years now, I got the flu 3weeks ago and since have been tired my 13 yr old daughter said "mom, I know your pregnant, I just feel it" so I went and bought a test easy enough pregnant or not pregnant right, well I took the test in the morning 1st thing and it said pregnant I was on cloud nine in shock my husband and I were elated, but I wanted to be sure before I got telling people outside my immediate family so I had a blood test "It was Negative" I'm so tired from this emotional rollercoaster and I called Clearblue they said they want all the packaging and are sending me an envelope to send it in to them for their lab to review,, I looked here and it seems I'm not the only one, what emotional distress, I think I'd pull this product until the testing phase is over, or until all the kinks are worked out..$LABEL$0,0,-100

Exciting!. With his first novel, Dan Blankenship shows he has a real gift for writing. The Running Girl is suspenseful and exciting! The classic tale of good versus evil. The characters are well written into the author's vivid imagination. This book shows a positive family situation with a good message and I would classify this book as Christian reading. There are a lot of religious beliefs and ideas that may not be shared by all readers. I look forward to reading more suspense writing in the mainstream from this author.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Good bag for a small camera.. I bought this bag because Amazon had a big discount on this bag if bought with the Nikon D40x. I don't understand because this bag is soo small for a DSLR like the D40x. The only way I can carry a lens with the camera is if I leave the 18-55mm attached to the body, and then orient it upright. However, for a point and shoot or a prosumer camera, this is a great bag. (Although I don't know why you would need all this space for a point and shoot) It's got lots of pockets and is very sturdy. Couple of useless things on the bag, the zipper to close the inside body is very hard to close and not necessary. Also, not much you can fit into the little zippered pocket on the top flap of the bag.I am speaking about this bag from a camera point of view though. I can see how this bag would be quite useful and spacious for a digital video camera.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great book. Great book. Really practical, clear, balanced and logical. I've read a lot of books in this area of study lately and it is unquestionably one of the best. A good balance using the most pertinent information from cognitive behavioral, psychotherapy and spiritual studies. The case studies are great. It's nicely grounded.

Great Fun. I have read some negative comments on this game, all I have to say to is, where's your sense of fun?

Mediocre At Best. Another reviewer said that it is lamentable that MIT is no longer using this book. I'm an MIT student that had to use this book and am very happy that MIT had enough sense to change texts.

I wound up using my high school AP Calculus book by Thomas/Finney (I think this is the book MIT uses now) rather than this text. There are a number of excellent Calculus books published, but this isn't one of them. Anybody who says this is the best calculus book hasn't reviewed many books.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Their best album...Technical deathmetal, at its best!. Cryptopsy are a band that althought their sound changed quite a bit? They still manage to come out with some amazing music..."None so vile" by cryptopsy is in my opinion their best album todate and its even better then their debut "blasphemy made flesh" which was a very amazing technical album but had horrible production. Now onto, "none so vile" ? If you love your deathmetal technical,intelligent, amazing drummer (Flo) and originality for days? Get this album!As for the vocals ? I prefer lordworn's vocals over Chris barnes (sfu) , George "corpsegrinder"fisher (cc) ,and, Will rahmer (mortician), I mean those are the worse bands and all of those bands have horrible vocalists. If your a deathmetal purist? Then buy cryptopsy' "none so vile" because its a masterpiece.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Clara was a pathetic, unfulfilled, horny character who gives romance writers a bad name and McClain was an arrogant jerk who was always being rude and insulting to her.

Classics won't scare you anymore. I just couldn't believe Emile Zola's genius when I heard that he wrote Therese Raquin on a newspaper manager's order of a detective novel.He simply read the newspapers for a clipping about murder and started writing it. What is surprising here is not how he started the novel but how he managed to make it a classic. It is a classic indeed, with an exception that I can offer it not only to "classics" readers but to any reader who is not conservative(for the book shows pure reality that is contrary to general taboos). It has everything that a classic should have: great use of language, a style(ie naturalism ), an insight to human feelings, mentality and conflicts, permanence through the years. What's more, it has everything that a bestseller should have,too: fascination, big events like murder, intrigues, love, hatred, sensuality. Perhaps you will find even more when you read the novel. It is everything one expects from a book.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Stop kidding yourselves.... Look, Gnecco's voice is extraordinary--there's little doubt about that. But there isn't one decent song or original turn on this whole album. It's all forgettable overproduced noise, and its edge is completely dulled by its own indulgent and corporatized marketing 'package.' I kinda wish they just cranked out a low budget live thing instead of this Dreamworks-2-years-in-overdevelopement monstrosity.I saw this guy play in a coffeeshop in northern New Jersey--just him and a guitar--and he was pretty damn impressive. He should hire/collaborate with a guy who can write and produce a decent song and become very, very, famous.This album could and should have been a lot better.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Bulky, but very useful. Until the recent release of low power CF wireless lan cards, this was your only option for going mobile with you iPaq Pocket PC.

With new Pocket PC 2002 iPaq's (or the pending upgrade from Compaq for current owners), you can use VPN features while away from the office.

Yuch!. I listened to the audiotape of this book. The reader did the best she could with the incredibly cornball dialogue and trite descriptions, but it was still barely tolerable.If I heard the words "Little Bear Lake" and "Robert Flaubert" one more time I would have screamed. Who told the author that constant repetition was a GOOD thing? Somehow she must have the idea that it is somehow romantic to constantly repeat names and places.Not only is the story trite and predictable, but the bigger than life protagonist and his idolicized dead father are annoying as hell. If Robbie was so perfect then why on earth did Maggie dump him? And the wize words that come out of 25-year-old Elliot's mouth are ludicrous. Quoting the Great Gatsby?

short lasting HDTV for over $200!. I had bought this item at SAM's Club in Sept. 2008. The TV started acting up near the end of April 2009.

Early-90s "dump" to CD needs RE-MASTERING!. There's a problem here. The Cars sold mega-platinum, especially Heartbeat City, which virtually defined the mid-1980s sound and look. So! Why is this CD a crude, early transfer with virtually no packaging?Seems the problem is, Elektra's out of business, or bought-out by a larger, more apathetic company. Also, could be the more "casual" Cars fans are tired of these Top Ten singles and MTV staples.Being ignored are we, the long-term, die-hard Cars fans who listen to EVERY album, EVERY summer ("it turns me upside-down / like a merry-go-round"). Whether this album is too commercial, or that other album too "arty" is NOT THE POINT.

Good Working Picture of the Opening. This book offers advice for the practitioner of the Spanish. It is reasonably complete in the fact that it covers the opening from the point of view of black's responses.As you know the Spanish goes 1. e4-e5, 2. Nf3-Nc6 3. Bb5 ... It is here where the author starts. The book goes through all the major variations in some detail. (Often my computer will eventually diverge down some hidden lines of play which were overlooked by this book.) The only major drawback with this book is that the exchange variation is not covered in-depth.Overall, this is a good book and recomended for any player. (Also, if you are a beginner and are looking to study the openings, the Ruy Lopez and the Queen's Gambit are a good place to start.)$LABEL$1,0,-100
I Fell Using This Bath Mat. These mats are very large and have a great thick rubber feel. But the "suction cups" on these mats can be problematic. The second time I used my mat, I moved to turn around in the shower and instead of the "suction cups" gripping the tub and keeping the mat in place, the mat suddenly slid down toward the drain. The thick rubber surface of the mat kept my feet in place, so my feet slid with the mat. I tried to catch myself, but it happened so fast that I couldn't. I fell very hard and landed squarely on my rump in the tub. I was sore for 3 days following this incident, but otherwise I was okay. This was a frightful experience and the one good thing that came of it was that I got to stop my 83 year old Mother from using the mat I had purchased for her. My Mother is very frail and had she slipped on the mat and fallen as hard as I did, I have no doubt that she'd have fractured bones.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Put your money towards something else. We have had nothing but trouble with this thing. Like other reviewers said the part that lifts up to empty the potty is not convenient. The latches on back to keep it together are very flimsy. The step stool only works when you take the potty apart and turn it upside down. The only time its convenient is if you are ready to move the seat to the adult toilet and use the step stool part as a step stool full time. But the worst part of this thing is the splash guard. My son never played with it. But once it was moved to the big toilet it would often come off and fall into the large toilet all on its own as my son was trying to get down. One day it fell off while I was taking him off the potty and I flushed before I realized it was in there. No, I didn't expect the chair to potty train my child for me but I certainly expected something that wouldn't fall apart.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Horrible Conversion!!!. I love this show. That said... the creators of this masterpiece should have the right to shoot whoever made these DVD prints. When the DVDs do actually play, they look like I made a copy with a pudding covered VHS tape. On some episodes I can almost see through Sam if he has on black. The black levels are horrible. The coloring is just plain off. Colorized versions of old Gilligan's Island look better than this. Also, I thought I could get past the music part, but OMG it just sucks. Next time let me record some Casio songs and throw them in there... it'd be better! The music was such a part of the show.. I feel ripped off in every way buying this. Seasons 3-5. Season one played fines and had the music.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Teach ANYTHING to anyone?! I don't think so!. These books have the most misleading titles! Unless you are teaching Sunday school bible classes, this book is mostly useless, because the only examples it gives you are about how to better teach the bible. The title says 'teach almost anything to pratically anyone'. That is so NOT TRUE. Sure, it gives you some pointers, but I feel I have to squeeze the text really hard to get some juice.I bought this book and 'Almost Every Answer for Practically Any Teacher' hoping to learn how to teach better, and to get in touch with modern teaching skills. What a disappointment and a waste of money! The other book went straight to the garbage can.Another thing: if all the examples of bible teaching were stripped out of the book, it would be half the size and, perhaps, a much more pleasurable read. Maybe it would even earn another star!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Can't judge this book by its cover.... I was looking for a good "reference" book on VBScript that would cover each function, their methods, properties, etc. While this book does indeed contain this information, its only 100 of its 800 pages (in an non-indexed appendix). It tries to be a little bit of everything (COM, ASP, browser controls to name a few), but doesn't excel at any of its topics. For example, there is a 16 page chapter on using COM components in MTS (this is supposed to be a Visual Basic Script reference guide remember!) This is a topic that can't even be introduced in 16 pages.The book almost seems like outtakes from books that never quite made it to print.If you're looking for a good VB script reference, this isn't it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

So Outdated Dont waste your money!. This book was written in 1988, and refers to the mass suicide in James Town as "a few years ago." This book is completely outdated and truly truly for people who have ZERO self esteem. I admit I have my issues hence why i purchased this but even I couldn't finish, let alone really start this book. I spent a half hour attempting to read the beginning and skimmed for another 1/2 (see? I tried) I'm 21 years old and its completely irrelevant to these times, the way my generation thinks and behaves. My advice, leave this one alone unless your a pathetic wallowing mess who wants to read examples of other wallowing pathetic messes ( example: Robert R. "I hate my life because my gf left me." Susan Q. "My work makes me feel worthless" etc etc) No real advice just a bunch of bull. Whatever it takes to sell books I guess.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Excellent saw.. I bought this saw with some reservation to replace my existing Porter Cable 347's. Those saws were my favorite and I could no longer find them anywhere. I was pleasantly suprised that the saws power and design did not let me down. It appeared bulky from the pictures but the actual saw gaurds and the such are not intrusive like I thought they would have been.The basics are the same as the trusty 347. Nice substantial magnesium base, light weight, lots of power etc., but the subtle improvements (angled cut to the base, built-in sawdust deflector, rubber handle, to name a few) are very nice, making this saw a joy to use.Enjoy.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Excellent book for even reluctant readers!. I loved "Belle Prater's Boy" from the moment I began reading it, and my love only deepened when I began teaching the book to my 6th grade students. The children were immediately fascinated with the many mysteries in the book, such as the sudden disappearance of Belle Prater, the mysterious circumstances of Amos' death, and why Gypsy has strange, violent nightmares. The author skillfully reveals clues steadily throughout the book, causing readers to keep reading until their teacher forces them to put the book down. :-) My students loved examining the clues and playing detective to determine how the pieces fit together, as well as discussing the themes of forgiveness and how appearances can be deceiving. "Belle Prater's Boy" proved to be an excellent book for my 6th graders, many of whom are reluctant and/or struggling readers. I give it my highest recommendation for children's literature!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Interesting Beef Jerky. This brand of jerky has its own different, distinck flavor compared to other brands. It's quite a good flavor, I would call it interesting as it tastes different than most jerky's out there. The consistency is good, it has a nice texture, chewy and a bit juicy. It's not the best out there but it is very good in its own way. It has a bit of a sausage taste to it, kind of like a slim jim but you can barely notice it. Also, it is a bit salty. There is nothing out of the ordinary in the ingredients list.This is a good choice if you want a high protein, low calorie, low fat, and low carb snack on the go.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Hectically paced, poorly executed. Hermann Scherchen belongs with Jascha Horenstein in that quirky category of great conductors who recorded with such poor orchestras that it's often hard to listen to the results. Considering how truly terrible the Vienna Symphon(Pro Musica) was in the Westminster era, you have to tiptoe carefully indeed to avoid some real train wrecks. Even the Vienna Staatsoper orchestra, which is supposed to be composed of members of the Vienna Philharmonic, was veyr raggedy in those days. This is a breakneck Eroica performed without much technical finesse, yet among Scherhcen's Beethoven readings, it is typical in both respects.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A worthwhile read, but not for the mystery.... While I agree for the most part with the more prestigious reviews already posted, in the end, this book falls flat. Unsworth impressively whisks the reader back to medieval England, presenting characters who are sympathetic to a 20th century audience, and the story progresses in an interesting and thoughtful way. However, the final answer to the whodunit is much less impressive than the portrayal of the acting process, especially the interactions and improvisations that are part of every stage production$LABEL$1,0,-100

Dissapointing. A Steven Spielberg sci fi film starring Tom Cruise can create a lot of hype and expectations and unfortunately this film fails to live up to them. The film's first twenty minutes are compelling but once Cruise has to go on the run the film falls apart. The action scenes in this movie are laughable and their is far too much CGI. The process of how the precogs determine the future is not explained well enough either. Spielberg last great film was Jurassic Park and he has been slipping ever since, by focusing too much on effects and not on relatable charachters or compelling story.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Truly illiterate and truly fatuous.. I am 55 years old and have a master's in journalism. I am a professional copy editor. When I read this book I became so frustrated I came close several times to throwing it away.This book had to have been published without an editor. About every third sentence in the entire text is not a sentence with a subject and verb -- instead what you get is a clause, dangling by itself, with a period at the end.Also, the author must have sat down before he wrote this manuscript and compiled a list of every obscure word he could find in the dictionary -- or worse, German publications from the 1920s and 1930s -- and made sure he used every last one.If I knew a way to ask for my money back I certainly would do so.This book is a nightmare.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Let's get back to our roots!. The battle for everything is a wonderfully musical album that really goes back to the roots of a true artist. John more or less is Five For Fighting and his passion for music really shines through. Similar to America Town, there are classic guitar sounds combined with beautiful piano melodies. One Hundread Years, the single from this album, is the type of song that makes you think, laugh and cry. Disneyland just puts a smile on my face and reminds me of many summers at Disneyworld. NYC weather report really shows urban flare to it, and just is a wonderful song. I had very high expecations after America Town for this album, and John delivered 1,000 fold.

As one of the reviewers noted the useless pillows slide off, the sofa has a bar in the middle once it turns into bed and I have backaches all the time after I sleep on it.

Then next trip it rained and when we found out it was leaking everyhing was soaked soo bad that we had to pack up and go home.

For those that enjoy military SF.... While the author's style adds little to push the edge of the envelope in SciFi it is, when action is presented, a fast paced exciting read. This helps to cover the logic inconsistencies that pop-up from time to time. His character development leans too heavily on sterotypes, but that doesn't get in the way of the story line.

Too messy!. I bought Harrah my large dog some of this 2 years ago, and of course it smells SO GOOD, but it is just too messy.Most of the "bar" has been turned into powder from it being so brittle. So you get maybe 1/4 of the "ice cream bar" intact while the rest just sits on the bottom.I do not mind my Harrah having fun while eating a treat but even she was turned off trying to figure out where the "powder" went. (Since its freeze dried, unless you get a sizeable chunk the minute the powder is wettened by her nose or tongue its "melted") This just confused her and she ended up leaving the powder and small pieces alone.But if youre lucky and can get a pretty entact bar, I'd say give it a try.

Totally 70s. This is the sequel to the classic 1996 hit that parodied the cliches of slasher horror films. A typical updated slasher film, yet the brilliance lies in parodying that which it is, a chessey slasher film on a low budget. David Arqutte is a Clive Barker look alike. I gave it two stars because my tastes have changed since I was the geek rooting on the killer. At one dollar, you can't go wrong for cheap slasher flicks, except it lacks the drive in aura of Halloween or even the classic icons of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. As a straight slasher film series, this would be great, instead it's poking fun at the slasher film cliches. A joke it is.$LABEL$0,0,-100

sympathy for women over 50.... felt so bad that these wonderful beautiful talented actors had to resort to such drivel to make a sawbuck... at least Joan looked normal and aged well, Bette having to out ghoul the ghouls to illicit some scare tactics and rats n tweety bird for dinner just took the cake, and that dang song would not leave my head about that DaDDY!!! whose address is heaven above, well I wish that is were this film would go, the ending on the beach was unexpected but that ice cream looked good and back then they made it with the good stuff... Bette's daughter is abs gorgeous and expected to see more of her but after she witnessed this death march would expect she would steer clear, oh well, maybe a remake with Angelina Jolie and Jenn Aniston in 2025 is something to look forward to!! ;}}$LABEL$0,0,-100

Boring!!!!!!. I have been a Stephen King fan for years and loved his earlier books. This one is a disaster. I kept trying to read it but finally gave up. I think he has lost his ability to write great books such as The Stand, Carrie, Pet Sematary, Salem's Lot and other earlier books. Luckily I got this book as part of an introductory offer for membership in a book club. I'm glad I didn't spend much money on it.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Classic?. Seems most like to refer to "Heartbreaker" as his masterpiece, and while I tend to like "Love Is Hell" and "Cold Roses" a hair more, this is in my top three. Being his first solo album after he ended Whiskeytown, this naturally sounds like that band more than his later albums do. It's all alt-country here. After the intro track, this starts out rocking with "To Be Young (is to be sad, is to be high), then quickly mellows for most of the rest. Many of these are what I consider to be quality sad songs, if not lyrically, then musically. The first half of "Heartbreaker" I find the strongest, and a few songs are really slow, but the whole thing holds up well. There's no doubt this guy can write a good song. Again, this might not be the first Ryan Adams album I reach for, but It'll always remain in my vinyl collection.$LABEL$1,0,-100
First Rate Production is a MUST for Serling Fans. This is an excellent biographical documentary about the life and works of Rod Serling. It is brilliantly constructed and edited. This well crafted presentation is a first rate production all around. Rod Serling was a man of great literary and social intellect, somewhat ignored because of the genre he worked within and was famous for. His endearing legacy, "The Twilight Zone" frequently bordered on the edges of science fiction if not immersed in it. Society's values being what they are, science fiction has never been thoroughly embraced by conventional thought as a legitimate literary or cinematic art form until very recently. That is society's loss and Serling's heartbreak. I originally saw this documentary on Public Television and was pleased to find it issued on VHS. Highly recommended!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Funny, but it didn't make me feel any better about my weight!. Camryn Manheim is an sassy, award-winning actress and laugh-out-loud funny. This book is a personal account of her experiences of fat-ism and her journey to self-acceptance.Manheim is a natural storyteller and, being overweight myself, there was a lot here to relate to, but although I enjoyed the book, there were no groundbreaking revelations for me here ... though it does make a pretty strong case against society's obsession with being thin, this book is in no way a "self-help" book (to be fair, it doesn't claim to be) and it didn't help me to "make peace" with my fat. It did however make me laugh a lot and that's reason enough to encourage others to read it!Thank you Camryn, for speaking out for big women everywhere.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Bert and Fritz together at last!. This is a relatively straightforward propaganda melodrama, with nothingparticularly compelling to recommend it, but for one notable exception.Bertold Brecht's villains and miscreants are all so full of gusto.

Only for Mandy Fans!. I love Mandy Moore and was very excited to get this soundtrack. It was certainly worth it. Each Mandy song is gorgeous and she sounds lovely. Cry was the best song on her latest CD and probably one of the prettiest ballads I've heard. Only Hope is another romantic ballad that suits her perfectly and she sounds better that ever. Its Gonna Be Love is a mid tempo track that is sweet and catchy. The other tracks by the other artists are not as great. Fans of Mandy Moore are certainly not fans of the type of music the other songs are except for If You Believe by christian pop singer Racael Lampa. An uplifting ballad that showcases her amazing voice. The other songs by Toploader and Switchfoot are very slow, boring, and not very interesting. As I said, this is a must for Mandy Moore fans, she is at her best.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Amy's best pop music album. This is Amy Grant's best pop album. There are the hits we all know about such as Baby Baby, Every Heartbeat, Good For Me, That's What Love Is For, and I Will Remember You. But she also does well with the fun songs Galileo and Hats. Ask Me is an incredibley poignant song about sexual abuse. And You're Not Alone and How Can We See That Far are relationship ballads.Is this album "Christian" or "Pop"? The answer is it is a pop album that clearly has a Christian base - many references, some obvious (Hope Set High) and some not so obvious (Every Heartbeat) point to her faith in God.Top to bottom, one of the best all around pop albums if the early 1990s.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointing. If it were any other band, I'd probably rate this higher, but my boys just took a bad turn. I don't know what Chris was thinking when he wrote these lyrics. How he went from the poetic "Girl From a Pawnshop" off of Three Snakes to "Heavy" and "Kickin' My Heart Around" is beyond me. He used to write the best words. Also, the album has too much noise; if they've completely changed their style, I don't like it.

Not worth it. I had this thermostat in my home for 3 years. It mysteriously failed for 3 days last year (no AC) and then suddenly worked right before the AC repair man could arrive. It worked another year and experienced same issue but never regained consciousness. It would not keep the numerically selected setting. I could actually stand there and watch it climb or drop over 10 degrees in a matter of seconds, which in turn would immediately shut off either my heat or AC, whichever.

Relaxation & Meditation. Most people who are serious about meditating yearn for a combination of sounds that harmonize with music. I like many types of sounds, rain, ocean waves, tranquil melodies.I am sorry, Hans Peter Neuber presents to many instrumental pieces. It is hard to meditate when once into a nice mood an electronic oboe or electronic piano comes blairing to the forefront.

Flat and dissapointing. Although Sawyer writes competently I gave it 2 stars for failure to live up to possibilities. Two humanoid societies interact after 40,000 or so years of separate development with differing histories, cultures, values, etc. What happens? We obsess about the characters and love lives of Mary (the human) and the Neantherthal (whatsisnameagain, he looks like Arnold without the chin), a couple of boring representatives of their species. "Harlequin" as another reviewer labeled it, sounds right.I think Sawyer's desire that things turn out right prevents a sense of danger or conflict that might make things work. I kept waiting for the Pentagon to start war-gaming the possibilities (you could send an army over in New Mexico and have it pop up in Beijing for instance), for the Neanderthal vs Human championship(Neanderthals win), but all I got is this unrealistic plot and goody-goody philosophy.Oh well, back to the Martian Chronicles, Dune, whatever.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Really nice blend of fast and slow titles.

Bathtime fun!. I like this toy for my toddler son. We work on concepts "in" and "out" with the bugs in the net while he is in the bath. One thing I will note is that the toy we got has a pink net and a lot of pink in it. (Different than the current picture.) We don't mind but I probably wouldn't feel comfortable giving it as a gift to a little boy who is not my own because some people would think it is a girl's toy with all the pink.

Only Nick Carter, American superhero can stop him. Will he? Of course, but as expected by the title, lots of dead bodies litter the streets of the Middle East before its over.

People's, I Love You!. There have been {So Called} One Hit Wonder artist's that I thought were extremely underrated and they had Stunning Hits and one of those artist's is the band, People!. Their late 60s version of the song, I Love You, is worth the price of admission by itself plus they had other good songs too. I finally found myself an alternate Disc of People! with this song on it (it's the, Long Album Version, and I love it) and it's called "Best of People!

"Sunrise" remix- NOT worth it!. I LOVE Duran Duran, but I wish I had my money back for this import single. "What Happens Tomorrow" is an incredible song, but I bought this for the Eric Prydz Mix of "Sunrise," hoping to finally hear a club mix that actually included the vocals. (The first batch of remixes found on the "Sunrise" single all neglected to include Simon's full vocals.) Disappointed again! The beat to this version is great, but it is only 3 & a half minutes long & features only a few background vocals at the beginning. I guess there will never be a full-out vocal club mix available on CD. The closest thing I know of is the Jason Nevins Mix on the "Queer Eye" soundtrack.Bottom line: Someone needs to take lessons from bands like Erasure, who still put out singles with multiple remixes & non-album songs that are well worth the money. 13 bucks is just too much for an album version that I already have & a short, vocal-less club mix.

So once I set the volume I'm ok. It's nice to have the pause when I stop next to one of my riding buddies and I don't have to dig out the ipod to pause it to hear what he is saying.

It is not flimsly - sturdy and well made.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Hilarious...... Oh dear? This is for real???????. I thought "Redneck woman" was a hilarious camp send-up of Country & Western music until the truth dawned on me - that this Gretchen Wilson woman was for real.Being ingorant, illiterate, uncultured and narrow minded is not a sin - as long as one is endeavouring to do something about this situation. Celebrating ignorance is foolish.Dear Gretchen,Buy some books, do some reading. Travel and try to travel to some other countries. Listen to more music from other places and other times. Use the money you make from this CD to get yourself an education. I think you will be very embarrassed about this CD in the future. Sorry!$LABEL$0,0,-100
No es Karaoke. This isn't Karaoke. No lyrics display. This is strictly music without a vocal track. The lyrics are included in the liner notes, in little tiny print. Of course, if that's what you're looking for, the music is nicely done, and sounds like Mana.Este CD no es Karaoke. La letra no sale en pantalla. Es tan solo la musica sin cantante.

BROKEN AFTER 15 MONTHS!. I BOUGHT THE EDGER TRIMMER ON APRIL 25TH 2009. THIS IS IT'S SECOND SEASON AND ALREADY TWO BATTERYS HAVE GONE BAD. SO I BOUGHT ONE NEW BATTERY FROM THEM TWO MONTHS AGO AND 12 SPOOLS OF CUTTING WIRE.TWO DAYS AGO IT STOPPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER.NOW I'M STUCK WITH A NEW BATTERY AND TWELVE SPOOLS OF WIRE THAT IS OF NO USE TO ME.I CANNOT HONESTLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OUT OF THE 15 MONTHS OR SO THAT I HAVE HAD IT I ONLY GOT TO USE IT ABOUT 35 TIMES.

Necessary. The Fruit of Your Pain by Laverne Hanes-Stevens, PH.D is a necessary tool for anyone who wants to mature in their Christian walk. First, it helps one to accept the fact that there "will" be -not "might" be - seasons of struggle and pain in our lives. But, as the book explains, we can do more than simply accept that fact, we can actually be fruitful and grow as a result of our struggles. The 31 Meditations for Growing Kingdom Fruit exercises at the end of the book are especially helpful because it helps you to actually "develop" the fruit in your life.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Cute idea...cheap product.. This is just the product I was looking for as I searched the internet all month for the perfect toy for my car-loving 23 month old son. I was so excited to find this cute playmat. When I recieved it I was alittle worried about the durability, but my son loved it Christmas morning! It is now the day after Christmas and this morning I realized that the paperlike covering is peeling off of the mat, leaving white spots all over the cute town/road side of the playmat. It had not even been open for 24 hours. I am sad, because my son loves it, but the peeling stuff is a choking hazard so I had to put it up. The funny thing is, my son is young and has been very gentle with this mat. I wonder how fast it would have fallen apart if I had a 5 or 6 year old son!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Prime Livgren material . . . Moving. . .thus its Prime Mover. Prime Mover is a rerecording/rerelease of an album previously released by Livgren's former band, AD. I have never listened to the original Prime Mover album, but if it was half the quality of this disk, it was great material.In his earlier AD material, Livgren's exuberance over his rebirth sometimes overpowered his work. Gone was much of the subtlety that characterized his best Kansas material. By the time Prime Mover was created, he gained that subtlety back and he's put together some really good material here.Stand outs include Children of the Shadows, and Wandering Spirit. The remake of Fair Exchange, Kansas tune, is first rate, as are the new songs, Incantos and Out of Opus.New Kind of Love, a new kind of song for Livgren is the only tune that rubs me wrong. Just not my style, thats all.Production, material, performance all first rate, pick Prime Mover II up!Questions regarding this review, email me.$LABEL$1,0,-100

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR METAL MEATHEADZ. Most METAL people will probably say the SCORPIONS suck or that they are GAY and what have you. They only know the 80's material and unfortunately, the SCORPIONS probably do not play this kind of material anymore.ULI JON ROTH and his solo band is the only unit keeping this monumental music alive. Mere words will do this recording an injustice. The only thing I can say is that if you are a fan of RETRO 70's heavy rock, then you must seek this and LONESOME CROW by the SCORPIONS, for you would be truly missing out.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Impressive!!!. I had no prior knowledge of this movie other than seeing the dvd at Best Buy. I was able to rent a copy and was supremely pleased with the results. This is a high caliber action movie that was extremely gripping from start to finish with many surpises along the way. The pace was relentless with high octane action set pieces from start to finish.

Excellent book for Clinical Approach, good for basic facts. This book is divided into 2 parts: Part 1 deals with The Clinical Approach, and Part 2 deals with the Essential Background Information.The Clinical Approach is the best part and includes 10 chapters (CNS, Eyes, Limbs, Head & Neck, Abdomen, Respiratory system, CVS, Hematology, Diabetes, and Skin). It focuses on the physical examination, and on the symptomatology.The second part contains a summary of basic clinical facts about the diseases which you can read in any standard textbook. In addition, there're many important subjects which are not covered properly in this section (e.g. dermatology).This book is not intended to be a complete textbook, and I think it should be supplemented by further reading. The margins of the pages are large so that you can add your additional notes. It contains few diagrams (no photographic pictures) and many tables.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good workout for intermediate to advanced. The hour long, in-studio session on this DVD is excellent -demanding but without crazy, circus-type stunts. It is comparable to the Sadie Nardini DVDs I've tried. The only drawback in my opinion is the monotone, sometimes mumbling instruction that at times gets drowned out by the music (perhaps recording the instruction separately would've helped). I found the additional sessions filmed throughout the city peculiar. They lack instruction and aren't filmed in a way that makes following along very easy. They are artfully edited and show off Tara's skill but these qualities are likely of secondary concern to most shopping for yoga DVDs. These are minor quibbles though and the hour long session alone makes this a worthy investment for anyone looking for a challenging yoga DVD that will leave you sweating.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Very fast, Reliable CF Reader. This product is much too under-rated. I've used it many, many times with both my mac and my windows machine without a glitch. The data transfer rate is quite fast and reliable. The USB 2.0 interface makes transferring big amounts of files a breeze. It used to take my about 7 minutes for my camera to download 256Mb worth of pictures to my computer. With this reader, I do the same in about 40 seconds. For this price + some rebates you might find out there, you have a no-brainer here. Of course, the only caveat is that it only reads CompactFlash Cards, but if that's all you use, then it should not be a problem. Great Buy.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Classic, yet contemporary - and surprisingly good!. Fans of 1960's era Europop chanteuse - Francoise Hardy - will find much to be surprised and delighted by with 'Tant de Belles Choses' a contemporary (2004) album that plays hallmark to all of Hardy's strengths and charms while managing to sound positively fresh, relevant and certain to appeal to the post-millennium iPod set with absolutely no previous exposure to Hardy's works.While some tracks retain the classic 60's era Chanson sound (À L'ombre De La Lune' - 'Soir De Gala' - 'Grand Hotel'), the majority of the album uses modern studio production and instrumentation (eg - 'Jardinier Bénévole' - 'Sur Quel Volcan?' - 'Un Air De Guitare') that will easily fool listeners if you tell them that these are tracks by such melodic, atmospheric artists such as Air or Ivy. 'Tant de Belles Choses' is incredibly moody and melodic. Perfect rainy day music to deliciously gloom over, yet fantastically sexy all the way through thanks to Hardy's vocal magic.$LABEL$1,0,-100

An Incredible Waste. Josh Groban had such promise, with a tremendous voice with incredible range and a budding, strong presence. Then came "Live at the Greek." It saddens me greatly to see that Groban has sold out and is now paying for it with voice problems. They're notable from the very beginning of this concert DVD, where Groban sounds strained and nasal. There's no denying that Groban is a grown man in control of his career. He claims credit for this concert as a producer, writer, creator. Even if he didn't, he's getting paid mega wages for it. So I find it impossible to cut him any slack for such a poor performance. "Live at the Greek" is a waste of Groban's talent, and (I agree with other disappointed buyers), a complete waste of money! My advice? Get it at a used CD store. I'm sure the stores are full of them.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Egyptian Goddeath. I was 100% disappointed by the aroma of Egyptian Goddess. I put it on and immediately wished I hadn't. It stayed on for 3 good days, and I showered each day. I have tried to give it away, but nobody wants it. Next week it will be making it's way to the great-grandmother, maybe she will like it. To sum it up very quickly: Do not buy this scent if you are under the age of 75; it smells like old lady, exactly. Pretty much the same reason I cannot give it away.I would give 1 star, but I don't want to trash the entire Auric Blends line. Their Patchouli blend is awesome and I love that.

A kids review. Where the red fern growsBy Wilson RawlsWhere the red fern grows is a story about a boy who honestly wants a dog, gets two honestly, and honestly deserves every prize he receives.He earned the money for his dogs working for two years straight, piercing his feet on thorns to get berries, doing every chore he can do, and finally, he earns the 50 dollars and buys his dogs.His dogs are Little Ann and Old Dan, the two inseparable forever. Where one goes, the other follows, they would fight together, play together, hunt together, sleep together and die together, If they have to.I was required to read this book, and I was very uneasy about the coon hunting, but after a while, you understand what it means to Billy. I also didn't think much of chopping down a tree days on end to get one coon...But, it serves the purpose of showing what trust there is between the three, a determination that will never yield....Though it might have a sad ending, the end still leads hope.$LABEL$1,0,-100
What A Voice!!. Miki Howard deserves a better career than she has had, thus far. What a talent!! Her re-make of Aretha's "Till You Come Back To Me" is light-years better than the original. The test of a true talent & good voice is how it handles time. Aretha Franklin can't sing to save her life now. She has abused her body & voice with up-and-down obesity & smoking, such that she just cannot do it anymore, physically. Plus, she's embarrassing to look at, she is so overweight. Miki's talent & voice have handled the passage of time incredibly intact, flawless. I pray she keeps recording!! God bless you, Miki!!$LABEL$1,0,-100
My daughters' favorite book of all time. Both of my daughters were enchanted by this book. We got it when they were 2 & 3 years old. Children have rich imaginations and rather than being frightened (as some reviewers thought children might be) they felt empowered by the story. Parents are not always around when you're faced with a frightening situation. Ida was able to save her baby sister and return her to the garden because she listened to and acted on the internalized teachings of her father. And in the end, the goblins turned out to be "just babies, like her sister." All was well.While pre-schoolers may not have been able to explain this allegory, they understand it on a deep and personal level. In their late 20s now, my daughters still love this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

very dull. I saw the pretty good reviews of this book and expected a lot, consequently I kept reading expecting it to pick up, but it just didn't. Nick was basically a jerk; he (and this is a bad thing) seemed like an unnecessary character. He didn't have much depth and was annoying as was Pru whose shyness didn't disolve until about page 330. I couldn't take anymore blushing or stamering. The entire novel lacked quality dialogue/conversations. Finally, there seemed to be no basis for Pru's love for Nick and when he started to love her I just didn't understand how they could love each other and didn't believe it was possible in the way the novel was written. Basically this book was torturous to read.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Pleasant, Amusing and Enjoyable. I really enjoyed this book. It was a light, easy read and it was quite funny. I like Jon Ronson and I admire him for his courage.I'm not sure how much of the book I believe. I think that in a general sense it is probably all true-to-life but some of the specifics must have been embellished, if only to make them funnier. The occasional lack of believability doesn't make the book less enjoyable.Mr. Ronson showed a great deal of the human side of the extremists he studied. His exploration of the events behind the Ruby Ridge incident was particularly poignant.I'd like to see a followup story that describes the reactions of the people he interviewed for this book at having their stories published, having fun poked at them, etc. I wonder which of them (if any) were flattered/angry/pleased, etc. by it.This book was one of my favorite reads of the winter.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Extremely useful and highly recommended. Read Sklansky and Harrington last month. Very good books and a must read for anyone interested in playing poker well. Have been playing dealer's choice poker variations for about fifteen years. Have been playing Hold'em, specifically, for about four months now.The Sklansky and Harrington books give you a lot of theory. They teach you how to think about poker. This book gives you all practicum, which is especially great for the beginner and intermediate player. The author provides very straight forward explanations for his decisions, and in the process reinforces proper play, while also discouraging improper play.This book is a great complement to the other two books mentioned. Will help reinforce the basics -- plays that we take for granted, forget about, and therefore get wrong under pressure. Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning solid basic game play, or for reinforcing the basics as well.$LABEL$1,0,-100
There are others that work better. There are other peelers that work better...especially the part that is supposed to make the initial cuts into the skin. This one uses a very small plastic blade situated in the middle of the side of the instrument, which makes it difficult to "sweep", or manipulate around the circumference of the fruit.The ones that work the best are those that have an elliptical blade at the end of the instrument, and all you have to do is make an initial cut to get it under the skin and then simply pull it around the fruit.$LABEL$0,0,-100
No Fine Balance Here. Mistry's ability to interweave several heart-breaking stories in detail is prodigious. However, looking for balance is a relentless grind -- this novel is entirely too long, depressing and bereft of hope, despite the 'fine balance' between hope and despair it purports to represent. The concluding chapters are especially contrived and frankly, unbelievable. The story grinds to a halt in much the same inexcusable way as A Man in Full, leaving this reader especially vexed at wasting so much time reading it. The attempt to associate this tale with Balzac's Pere Goriot is hubristic at worst, wishful thinking at best.$LABEL$0,0,-100
They are ok BUT.... I originally decided to buy these OXO measuring cups because the price was reasonable and it has more cups then normal. At first I thought the extra cups were nice even though they are not really necessary.I've had them less than a month and already the numbers are coming off. LESS THAN A MONTH! I've come to realize the extra cups are actually a liability because they are hard to tell apart without the numbers on them. I would not buy these again. I feel like I've wasted my money.

Highly disappointed. This was a Plus size elizabethan costume. The material was what is to be expected from a $50 halloween costume- you want nice you have to pay a lot more. There were two problems. The first and main problem is Plus size women tend to be well endowed. The costume fit everywhere but the bosom area. The only plus size women the costume would have fit would have to be absolutely flat chested, as I am sure the model probably was. Even taped down I could have never fit my ample chest into this thing. And if you were taller than 5' 5" the costume would be too short. The additional curves of a plus size drew it up some. I am 5'10" and it came halfway up to my knees- not even close to the ground.The makers need to realize that there is more to a plus size outfit than adding a little extra material on the sides. Buyers beware.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Unfortunate choice of actors. I enjoyed the whole "romantic comedy gone wrong" theme, and the music was well thought out.

Not what I had hoped for.... I realize that I'm cutting against the grain of all of the earlier reviews, but I found The Discovery Study Bible to be decidedly disappointing. I've owned it for about a year now, and it is still my least favorite Bible.I find the formatting to be distracting and obtrusive. I actually have a hard time finding certain passages because of the unnatural way that the "study centers" are inserted into the middle of the text. I do not find the margin helps to be very helpful at all. The dictionary in the back is too short to be of much use. I'd rather have a concordance than the multiple blank pages for notes in the back. And as trivial as it may sound, the cover design is just plain ugly.Ultimately, I find the features of this study Bible to rarely add to my study of the Scriptures. I only use this Bible when it's my only option at a given time and would not recommend it to anyone. I would strongly recommend the QUEST Study Bible instead.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Stylish and Durable, with a HORRIBLE LEAKING PROBLEM. I have three kids, and for the third time, I am utterly dissapointed with Avent's product. With each new child, we bought a fresh supply of bottles, hoping Avent had fixed this problem. We really wanted these bottles to work, as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market, and our kids never had any problems with the nipples. However, each time, we ended up having to switch to another brand.The leak is not just a spot here or there. It is often a torrential downpour, leaking out the sides of the white cap. I know many people who have had the same problem.For as expensive as these bottles are, I would think Avent would take more pride in their product, fixing such simple things as a leak.Don't waste your money.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Heed the warnings!. I should have checked the reviews on this one before buying. Learned my lesson. Can't buy Mary Jo Putney without doing that anymore. The only reason I'm not giving this story one star is because it was good and kept my interest - until Viola's big reveal. I figured early on that she was a bastard and that it was her natural father who gave her the property. I was not prepared in the least for the wagering whore part - and she was a talented and good one too. Just yuck. My heroines don't have to be virgins, just not... this. And the reason that she was one made no sense at all. Ferdinand was likable enough. Charming, good-looking, sexy, a bit of a naughty fellow growing up. Yet, he was a virgin at 27. I'm sorry this reversal of rake/whore and angel/virgin was nothing but revolting. As a result I quit reading at page 215.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Fantastic Movie. This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time. This movie can be interpreted in so many ways and can mean many different things to many people. The young star does an incredible job, considering her experience. It is difficult to decribe much about the movie itself without giving much away. In general, for me, the movie is about the fact that the love of parent and child is the same no matter the socioeconomic status of the people.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not worth the price. This is an ok monitor. It seems to have good range and even has a nightlight feature you can use in the room but it has terrible feedback and goes through batteries like crazy. If I leave it plugged in, the feedback is ten times worse and so loud! Using just the batteries we can use it maybe one night and a few naps the next day. To make matters worse, there is no low battery indication so many times it has died on me and meanwhile the baby has been awake and crying for sometime. Now I feel like I have go upstairs and check on him every 5 minutes while he naps. For this much money, it should at least warn you when the batteries are low. Got out of the shower today to find it had died again. That's the last time, we're getting another monitor.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Never buya gift card from amazon. I bought my mom an online gift card (emailed) from Amazon and it turned into the worst, most stressful present I ever bought her. The gift card took over a year to use including extra money Amazon gave her for her inconvenience. Amazon dose not mention that the gift card can not be used on every item. Also, after checkout the gift card may only apply 20% to each item, leaving you with money left over and your credit card charged when you thought you finished the gift card.

What happened?. How did Art Alexakis, frontman of Colorfinger, one of the greatest alternative punk bands in the world, go on to form a band that was even heavier, and then turn them into MTV fodder? This is an album that can stand with Soundgarden's "Ultramega OK" and Mudhoney's debut. Art's vocals are angry and tourtured by the tribulations that were happening to him at the time, not by the memories of those tribulations like the "Learning How to Smile" album. If you enjoy "Heroin Girl," "When It All Goes Wrong Again," "Twistinside" (a Colorfinger song by the way) or old proto-grunge like Mudhoney or older Nirvana, absolutely check this out. Nirvana's "Bleach" is a good album. This is better. This is emotional, hard-hitting rock and roll.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not for everyone, but.... A touching and humanistic look at a young female necrophiliac. Explores the roots of her fascination with death and her adult sexual conflicts. I like how this movie de-categorizes people with sexual deviations; we cannot so readily label this woman a "pervert" after we see this movie. We can identify with her because, we all have secrets and skeletons. "Mental disorders" are not so easily dismissed when we see how they develop from circumstances that could've happened to any of us.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Fun Travel Companion. I got this book as a going away present and enjoyed it tremendously. It's a travel book with a twist, an insider's view of the people and crew inflight. Some of the strong points are the humor and feelings that are in some of the chapters. One flaw is that unless you are a frequent traveler, some of the humor is missed. A Frank Steward is at times quite frank, so if you can't laugh at yourself, than this isn't for you. Overall rating 8 out of 10. I look forward to the next flight.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointed. I bought this book in a moment of weakness because I needed something to read on a trip to Ireland. What a struggle, both to read and not to discard. The story line was a 19th century version of a Super Mario game in which Charles and Melanie Fraser wandered all about London looking for gold ring that would get their son, Colin, back. At every turn, things get more convoluted and contrived: ... Gimme a break, please.

a big waste of paper. Most readers, including myself, were disappointed with this book. I expected to read about Led Zeppelin's musical creations, not their several encounters with groupies. Although the groupies played a big part in the band's writing and behavior, we did not need to have every detail about what they did. Richard Cole talked more about groupies and his own life than any of the band members. I was hoping to learn what Led Zeppelin was like in the studio, on stage, etc., but this book was about trashing of hotel rooms, relations with women, and other useless information that had nothing to do with the great music they created. I was going to give this book to my thirteen year old son for his birthday, but after reading it, I realized it is NOT for young teens.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Worth it for "Missing You". Now that he has passed away, I recall how much I liked "Missing you" in 1982. It has a bold wall of sound, rare for him, and a good hook.

We HATE this carseat. We have 3 month old twins and are returning 2 of these terrible carseats. After 2 hours of trying to install these seats, we've decided that they are not safe. In the rear facing position, it is impossible to tighten the Latch belt enough to prevent the seat from moving from side to side. We also tried installing it with the car seat belt and did not have any better luck. The "level with ground" guideline (on the side of the should harness) was only level when the base was placed half way up the back of the seat. This left only 2-3 inches of the base supporting the weight of the child and the carseat.The seat is also HUGE. We have a Volvo S80 and a Chevy Tahoe and neither are large enough to accommodate this carseat in the rear facing position. Because we have twins, we have to place the seats behind the driver and passenger seats making both very uncomfortable.This may be a good seat in the forward facing position but it definitely isn't a good "3 in 1" seat.$LABEL$0,0,-100

What were the publishers thinking?. In assessing this book as chick-lit? It's really a very well defined genre right now, and just because the protagonist sleeps with ten men, doesn't make it chick-lit. The novel is dark and dreary (really); the main protagonist comes across not as courageous but as immesurably whiny.I'm surprised at the reviews and reviewers also, one of whom dubbed this a true successor to Bridget Jones--there is no way Gray can measure up to Fielding's witty style.The book has very few redeeming features. The writing is leaden, weighs you down (where was her editor?) and add to that the darkness of the book, it's suffocating.There's a blurb at the back from some Suzanne Finnamore who felt "inadequate as a writer more than once" upon reading this book. Well. All I can say is if THIS book makes you feel inadequate, perhaps you shouldn't quit your day job.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I have had previously a Casio HD600 for 18 months so I already knew the gimmick of this watches. In this model was aditionally important to me: 200 meter WR, shock & mud ressistance, the automatic light feature and the mineral glass. The buttons are stiff but not unpleasant. The only two things I would add are a bilingual week days (English-Spanish) and a 60/40 distribution of the dial for the hour-date display, since you look the time much more than the date.

I called Rocky Mountain Radar, spoke with Raul, and he advised me to go out and buy an extra wire (cost $14.99). Raul also gave me a list of conditions that needed to be met so that the unit will still work. I asked him if he had an extra wire he could send to me. His reply? "We are not a stereo store. You will have to buy the extra wire yourself". I asked Raul if other customers had advised him that the rear wire was not long enough.

Terribly scarred by ignorance. Sproul is a good theologon. Granted. Smart guy too. Very logical. But he has absolutely no idea about what he's talking about here. A main part of his arguement lies in the "fact" that quantum physics is logically impossible and therefore 70+ years of study into this field has been a waste of time and a number of Nobel Prize awards should be immediately recalled. Sprould doesn't in any way understand quantum and, when I realized this, I also realized that he could be sprouting anything he wants to about any subject on the hope that his audience has even less knowlege about it than he does. So, his book remains, in my opinion, a nice idea, but one that can in no way be backed up logically.$LABEL$0,0,-100

More fun than the LeapPad itself for my three-year-old.

readable historical account that is very relevant today. I came to this book as someone interested in new media rather than as an art historian, and I found it fascinating. Fried uses Diderot and other eighteen century art critics' writing to understand how the beholder of paintings is positioned. He uses an abundance of paintings (reproduced in good quality black and white) and citations of art criticism to show the ways in which painted characters ignore the beholder, first by being absorbed in quiet activities, and later in self-abandonment. While the beholder is clearly set apart from the represented world in history paintings, Diderot also writes about entering landscape paintings, stepping inside the world.I found the book very readable and thought-provoking, and relevant to far more than just eighteenth century French art. Personally I will use it in relation to our current notions of immersion and interactivity.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Reactionary Nonsense. This book could have been written in 1890; all the old rubbish is here - smug Anglo-Saxon superiority, the belief that "human nature" makes socialism and even serious reforms impossible, the angry assertion that the so-called natural order of things has been needlessly disrupted by such dastardly trouble-makers as Plato, Thomas Moore, Rousseau and, above all others, the red devil Karl Marx. Not a word here about the roles that the slave trade and piracy by such delightful fellows as Drake and Morgan played in the growth of capitalism in Britain and North America. If free market capitalism brings freedom, then how come such tyrants as Pinochet, Francisco Franco and Somoza loved it? And why did the German capitalists finance Hitler? John D. Rockefeller and J.P.

Horrible for the New Generation. My 11 year old son was assigned this book this year, and he absolutely hated it.

Justified 1. Proper combination of philosophy, anthropology, and action, among a plate of characters sufficiently diverse to give anyone a someone with whom to identify, all neatly justifying behavior that is, at once, both right and wrong, revealing difficult choices confronting the human condition. Ultimate redemption, and its failure, commitments and their inadequacies, all held together with humor and irony, and just plain excellent acting. This is a series for all, from writers to watchers: no one gets out unchanged.$LABEL$1,0,-100
This is a Great Diaper Pail!. We received this diaper pail as a shower gift and absolutely LOVE it. The system is SO easy to use, and, unlike what some reviewers say, can be done one-handed. We use about 10 diapers a day for our 3 month old daughter and have to empty the pail about once a week (usually on trash day!). It is a cinch to empty - when the last one is dropped in, turn the knob several times, push the cut button and turn several more times. Then, just open the bottom of the pail and pull out the "string" of individually wrapped diapers. To start a new string all you have to do is tie a knot and you are ready to go! Since we have brought our daughter home, we have used 6 of the refills, which costs about $30 total, bringing the monthly cost to around $10 so far. I'm sure it will go up slightly when she starts on solids. We have not had problems with the smell - there isn't any. The little bit of extra money is well worth the ease to me.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Folding Speakers but poor sound quality! =(. I bought this hoping I could get a portable speaker set that didn't use batteries. However, I was a little worried by the outer appearance of the box that had different sports ball on it (like a soccer ball). It immediately made me think that they sent the wrong. But after opening, it matched the description of when I bought it. After I tried it, only one of the speakers worked. The other had a scratchy, fuzzy, static-y sound. I don't know if mine was defective... but I would suggest you to pay a little more for better quality. Or just purchase ones that use batteries...$LABEL$0,0,-100

A member of a quiet set speaks out. The author explains many aspects of a loner's lifestyle, and how such a person interacts (or not) with society. The lives of both historical figures and contemporary celebrities are referenced. Many examples from pop culture are looked at. Being a loner is neither promoted nor explained away. The sentiments in this book are the result of an informed, unapologetic, balanced (and unpopulated) vantage point. No matter what degree of loner or sociable person you are, you will be informed by and be able to relate to this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

An Intelligent Mystery. I'm not a big mystery fan, so I DIDN'T guess the killer right away (and I'm not sure I believe those who say they did...), but I agree that the real pleasure of this novel is in the writing itself - Nelson's prose is fluid, his metaphors apt, and his insights into the position of the gay male in society at the turn of the millenium simply dead on target.

Terrible sound quality- like a cheap radio (I returned them). This sony PRODUCT MDR-RF975RK was aweful. The volume was very low, I had to crank the volume on my sterio to hear anything, there was lots of static and as you moved around it would suddenly turn into a deafening screeming sound. I was unable to use these comfortably at home or at work. In neither place do I have a cordless phone, but there was tons of interferance and they were so abrasive to my ears I gave up beacuse I was afraid I'd get ear damage. I let them charge for a full 24 hours before I used them.I would not even try these- they sound worse than a 2$ raido speaker. My guess is that you have to have a chord, or maybe infared technology instead, or maybe you can;t live in a city ( like I do), and must not have any electornics anywhere near them.I bought these from ( and returned them to) Vanns, which was A GOOD COMPANY to deal with.

The dead orchid. "Wild Orchid" is an erotic movie starring Mickey Rourke and some other people. Essentially, it's a pornographic movie, another attempt to mainstream porn. Above all, it's a *failed* attempt to mainstream porn. The movie is really bad, and can almost be considered an unintentional parody of pornography. My favourite scene is when Young Woman enters car, and finds Older Woman having sex with Man. She is distressed and asks Rourke to stop them. Rourke responds, in a voice that's supposed to be erotic and passionate: "I WANT TO, BABY. BUT I CAN'T. I JUST CAN'T".HA HA HA HA HA.Mickey is a really bad First Lover.Later, the prudish Young Woman and Mickey (who both have sexual inhibitions of some kind) finally "do it".

A slip from mr. Harrold. Glenn Harrold's produces fine hypnotic CDs and much of his work is first rate. Unlike some of his master pieces (A Chakra MeditationandUnleash Your True Potential) this CD however is not worth much.

The Outsiders. The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton, describes the lives of young adults when they are going through tough times. The "greasers", Ponyboy, Sodapop, Darry, Two-Bit, and Dally are the poorer boys of the city. The Socs,(also called the Socials) are the higher class of boys in the city. They bully and beat-up the greasers just because they are poorer than they are. I enjoyed this book due to the characters, how they act, and how humorous they are. My favorite characters are Darry and Ponyboy. I like Darry because he is smart and strong. I also like Darry because he likes to show off his muscles. I like Ponyboy because he enjoys movies and he always sticks to his gut feeling. You should read The Outsiders- it is a great book!$LABEL$1,0,-100

They don't fit!. My son is 3 and weighs 26 lbs, and they do not fit him around the waist. His little butt is constantly sticking out. They are bulky on him and he complains about them being uncomfortable. He can easily pull them down, getting them back up is another issue though. Because they are so big, they roll funny and he needs help to get them back up. They also do not reattach once you tear the sides, and this is a tad annoying.

Very Lightweight Rain Suit. I have used my rain suit loads of times. For some reason, the bum of my pants is always wet after riding my bike while the ground is wet. I use the rain jacket and the rain pants, and the jacket comes below the top of the pants. The rain is not coming from the top of the pants and leaking down. I have observed that much. It seems to be coming from the seam; but when I inspect the seam, it appears intact. It's kind of a mystery to me.

A great recital disqualified by unacceptable sonics. The absurd price being asked for this CD on the used market will no doubt be enough to put buyers off, but in case the unwary are tempted, I must report that the sound is dismal, Richter's piano being reduced to a thumping, boomy blur that is frankly unlistenable. Too bad, because the recital in Helsinki from August, 1976 includes a potent account of two Richter favorites, Beethoven's Op. 10 no. 3 sonata, in which he found strong shades of the composer's middle period, and Schumann's "other" carnival piece besides Carnaval, Fashingsschwank aus Wien, given a rollicking, high-spirited reading. Luckily, because they are favorites we have rival performances that sound much better.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Amazingly good for the price. Before the holidays, I shopped around for an "inexpensive" digital. I hated to spend big money on something that will be obsolete in a year or two. (I already have an entire shelf in my basement with computer equipment we no longer use) Amazon listed this as one of the 10 best cameras, so for [the price], what did I have to lose. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the image. (I am a comercial artist) Print it out on a good ink jet printer, on photo quality paper, and you get great results. Plus, I can use it on my Mac and my husbands PC. Installation on both platforms was super simple. You don't need any kind of real computer experience to be able to download from camera to computer. I plan to buy another for my in-laws. It's no Nikon, but I'd definatly recommend it to anyone wanting to get an easy to use digital.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The Great Lost Velvet Underground Album!. The cover, which shows a gauge tilting into the red toward "VU", suggests that this will be a loud, grinding affair like the group's first two albums, but the truth is that this nice, laid-back set of previously unreleased songs belongs to the general period of THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, the group's third album. Most of the songs here probably would have gone onto a fourth album had the group not changed labels. Oddities include the rollicking "I Can't Stand It," the sensitive "Stephanie Says," the goofy "Temptation Inside Your Heart," and the country-influenced "One of These Days."

Not just for acoustic lovers. I really enjoy listening to this great acoustic music. I agree with people about it being a little repetitive, but it is still great. You can play this cd from start to finish, and with each track you will feel the strange power coming out of this acoustic music. It reminds me of grunge, and it is heavy. But don't think of it as originally heavy songs with distorted guitars played in acoustic, like in MTV Unplugged series; these songs were written FOR acoustic guitars. So there is a different feeling to this music, it is very different from the regular grunge we usually listen to. And it works.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A DVD documentary re-examining the war between Israel and Arab nations. Originally shown on public television, Six Days in June: The War that Redefined the Middle East is a DVD documentary re-examining the war between Israel and Arab nations that left a historical legacy lingering to the tragic Middle East conflict raging in the current day. Shot on location in Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Moscow, and Washington, Six Days in June incorporates recently declassified archives, home movie footage, personal photographs, and recreations to unfold a composite picture of the war from beginning to end. Highly recommended, especially for public library collections. 108 minutes, letterboxed, color.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Ultra Vision, comes in clear, but Rightlight fails. The camera resolution would be good if the Rightlight 2 didn't make the image so dark, even with lights on. I called Logitech but was on hold forever. When they gave me the option to leave a call back number, they never called back. I returned this product and got the Logitech Communicate CTX instead. Lower resolution, but it uses Rightlight 1 which actually seems to work. One would think if Rightlight 2 didn't work, they would not push that for any of their camcorders.But I would recommend avoiding any logitech cams that use Rightlight 2 until some one actually says they fixed the bug.

Disappointed. Since George Harrison is a great musical spirit, who brought and still brings so much joy to us now, this documentary movie was a severe disappointment. It was so bad, it was almost laughable. It appeared that the movie was made in someone's basement -- the quality, in addtion to the content, of the film -- was very poor.Curiously, there were no words or songs by Harrison in the movie, perhaps, because the producers could not get the copyrights or permissions from Harrison's estate. If this was the case, it was a good thing they did not get the permissions, as this was an awful rendition of what should have, and could have been done to honor this great music giant.There is still a movie to be made, so wait until someone else makes, it, cause you won't find it here.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Too Little About Too Much. I borrowed this book from the local library and found it to be one of the most unwieldly books in existence! It weighs a freakin' ton and needs to be put on a table (instead of your lap) to look at. Totally impractical. Additionally, the photos for the most part aren't all that great. Information is minimal. What irritates me most is each country's skeletal map which doesn't show it's relationship to the rest of the world. Oh sure, you can go back to map of the world at the front of the book and read thru all the tiny names to find the country you are looking at, but you'll probably fracture your arm in the process. Individual maps could at least have shown the country within it's continent or region. A much better book for travelers is National Geographic's Journeys of a Lifetime 500 of the World's Greatest Trips. It may not include every country in the world, but it's much more informative, original and the photos are gorgeous!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not soothing. These synthesizer versions of classical songs get really old, really fast. Worse yet, the songs are sometimes not soothing at all, especially the very first song.

Save your money or invest in a Pump in Style. I got this pump because I only needed to pump for an occasional short separation from my daughter. This was the pump that Medela recommended for my needs, however, the pump is so weak that it was a total waste of money (I used it once and now it's in the closet gathering dust). I ended up getting a Pump in Style, which is great. It was a little more, but hey, I'm saving a lot by breastfeeding, and it really has been a godsend - I can pump and go out knowing that my little one doesn't have to settle for formula. If you want to pump, don't bother with this one - manual expression of milk would be just as fast!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Gave it a try. Books can be a tremendous waste of time, or a doorway to another dimension. I do not read entire books to wait for them to get good. If a book stinks at fifty pages, I stop, as I did with the Known World. Look at all the bad reviews of this book; they all say the same thing. The author introduces very many characters that are just glossed over. There is no penetrating analysis of thought processes, there is only brief description of events, making for a jumbled, slow, boring, and confusing read. Life is simply too short to read entire books like this that are written excruciatingly badly. Not worthy of a Pulitzer. Not worthy of my time.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Random cutoff's blast you with static!!. While listening to my iPod the unit will cut off, and I am blasted by static from the station that I am tuned to. I have only intermittently been able to reset the unit using the button; most often I have to unplug the power adapter from the car and plug it back in before it will reset.Caveta: This is my first transmitter purchase so I don't know if the behavior is normal to transmitters or if my area (Honolulu) is prone to this problem. But regardless, the fact is that this unit cuts off completely, blasts me with static (loudly) since the volume has to be turned up louder than a regular FM station would be.I would not recommend this product. The auto-scan feature is gimmicky and the sequence for setting the menu presets is non-intuitive (i.e. press a button, press another button, hold one down for 3 seconds, press another button). There's only 3 buttons and I couldn't remember the sequence, no matter how hard I have tried.$LABEL$0,0,-100

First-rate writing, second-rate novel. I just finished my second Kate Atkinson novel, One Good Turn. Not as satisfying as Case Histories, the novel pushes Atkinson's penchant for free-association tangents to an extreme. The writing is consistently good/engaging, but the plot development gets distractingly self-indulgent in postponing the climaxes of events, one of the most egregious being when the author leaves an attack dog in mid-air as it leaps toward anti-hero Brodie.Most annoying, however, is a last-minute revelation about one of the characters, Gloria, in an effort to tie up loose ends. You can't get us inside a character's head to the degree that Atkinson does, revealing/analyzing Gloria's thoughts about the most trivial details of her life, and then expect us to buy that this woman did something both momentous and immoral and never bothered to ruminate about it. Cheap trick.Atkinson is a first-rate writer, but this one doesn't do justice to her talents.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Big Mouth & Ugly Girl are the two main characters of Joyce Carol Oates' novel, and the story is told through their observations, conversations and correspondence. It's both amusing and infuriating to see the plot unfold. You know where it's all going, and secondary characters are trotted out to move it all along.

George 'Win'ston. This cd is one of George Winston's best works, and if you aren't especially familiar with this artist, this would be a great starter. One thing I like about it is that it has many styles. For example, some of the scores are peaceful and soothing which can calm your nerves. There are also peices which are up-beat and fast moving which can get you going for the day(works for me!). But, if you don't especially like piano music, I suggest you don't buy it. There was this one guy who hated piano music, but he bought the cd, and what do ya know: he hated it! Big surprise huh? Anyway, you be the judge.

Total trash. I was looking forward to this after enjoying the first one. I was very excited about it having X-Box Live but found out that was a huge lie. Gotham Games needs to sit down with Tom Clancy to get going in the right direction for military style games. This thing still does not let you customize your weapon load out so your stuck with what they give you. Like Cpl. Jones blowing off all his ammo very quickly with that sorry MP-5. Pay attention no one goes into combat in a desert environment with a close quarters weapon. With the occasional building to enter is what your pistol or M-4 is designed for. Camera angles in many spots are very bad and your soldier often blocks your view. The game was also very short it was over too quickly with a very poor ending. I think I will stay away from Gotham Games for a while.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Please enter a title for your review. I watched the first 15 minutes, watched the next 30 minutes on fast forward, then turned it off. I couldn't see what relevence one scene had to the next or even what relevence one characters' line had to the other character's line he was responding to. The guy playing Jesus acted the role with the childlike innocence of an 18 year old and the score sounds like it was recorded on some overused analog tape in a really cheap studio, reminiscent of the b-grade horror films of the time. I guess it's the kind of movie you keep screaming at to convey something coherent but if you manage to make it to the end the few pieces that fit together will seem all the more important for the way in which they were presented. Defintely not a film for someone with a short attention span or anyone who has a need to understand what they're watching as if unfolds.

The actual hat that you get is floppy and not at all stiff and the red stitches do not even look like stitches.

H-Town was suppose to release another album this year, hopefully we can hear some more material from this talented group.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Disappointed. I ordered these 'heel seats' because my sister, my daughter and my nephew all swore by them. I was mildly disappointed. Unless my issue was so severe that it's going to take a long time, I haven't seen too much improvement. I'm not saying there hasn't been ANY, because I do feel some relief, but it's been about a month, and I was told that it would be almost immediate. THAT sure wasn't the case.I will keep wearing them because they do help some, and I want to see if, in time, I see complete relief.$LABEL$0,0,-100
This Teakettle is not acceptable. The major problem is after boiling water the metal sides are so hot and you can easily burn yourself if you touch them. This is dangerous. In addition, the top does not open wide enough to pour the water straight in from a faucet, the water level viewer is not on the side where it can be seen easily, but in back of the handle and it is not clear plastic ( hard to see level). The quantity level is in liters, not cups, even though it is called a 1-3/4-Quart teakettle. The numbers are hard to read behind the handle. Minor point: the model I ordered showed chrome color with black trim. I was sent one with gray trim and a silver top.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Disrespectful. In my opinion, the film disrespects the REAL man and women involved. USA love to change history to please its own people even its its to change heros and make them American. Ok alot of British have complained about the facts but concider this: if a worldwide release of a historical movie was made making George Washington an evil man or having japanese play the roles of the men that landed on the moon giving pride to be japanese or events at pearl harbour being british and not american. Do you think you would like it? enough said!I am American and love History but find it upsetting when hollywood makes films but dosent give the credit to anyone other that the Americans. Americans helped alot in WWII but actually it was the joint efforts of most nations hench it was called world war?!? the unsung heros are actually the russians, they fought the nazi hard,if they didnt fight the nazis we'd be screwed, the enemy of your enemy is your friend.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Wrong Purchase. I had seen the movie of "Why I Wore Lipstick: To My Mastectomy" and wanted the book. You see, I had just had a mastectomy that year. I ordered the right item but was sent the wrong book because they said they no longer had the item that I wanted. No, I did not send it back because it would have cost more to send back than what I paid. I didn't complain because I thought why? So, no I was not happy with what I got but it was because I did not get this book.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A bit complex but useful. We used this text in an advanced organic class. Having not had organic chemistry in a few years before taking this class, I had some catching up to do. This book is very dense, but can be very useful. Being a physical chemist I really liked the physical chemistry aspect of it. There is a lot of material in this book, and it's not always completely straightforward, but it's not impossible to understand. This is a good book for an advanced class or someone who wants a deeper understanding of organic chemistry.This is also definitely the largest textbook I've purchased in the last 4 years.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Just get it already.... Come on. It's Ty. Just buy the damn thing. If not for the sheer sake that the guy's brilliant at every aspect of making music. Is it as good as Safety? Hmmm... Probably not. I mean, touching the depth of Safety would be tough. Anyway, you know what? I'm gonna shut up, and you just buy it. K? Oh, and grab the new King's X as well. Not quite as good as Ogre Tunes, but...$LABEL$1,0,-100
It's Just A Cash Scam. You seriously think this band should get a best of CD this early? Or even get a best of CD? Personally, I can only tolerate their pre-Curse stuff, when the band used less polished production and didn't resort to lame pop-punk. But anyways, even if you are an Atreyu fan or not, don't buy this. It's just the Victory records discography minus a few tracks, and a real fan would obviously have all of their works.Also, they forgot the "Fractures" and "Visions" EP tracks as well (I know they weren't released on Victory...). If you want to make something worthy, at least re-release your older EP's on a CD so that the fans can get a taste of the band's early days.Avoid this, Atreyu fan or not. This is just another way for Victory Records to rake in the cash.$LABEL$0,0,-100
An Okay Game. I wanted to get this game because it was 5 stars and sounded good. But when I started to play the controls were hard and everywhere you went there were enemies. I couldn't get past the 1st level. You had to find something that was impossible to find. But the graphics were a 10 and the weapons were good too. That's why I gave it 2 stars. It's a good game for those who like a 1-level game and those who just like to roam around. It's not worth buying.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Isadora Rolls in Her Grave. How Sad! The magic of the Dance is missing. (Like painting by numbers.) Where is the movement of the Soul? Modern Dance later removed the soul from the body and left us with bodies moved by brains, there is no place in Duncan for this! Have these dancers found their "Motors?" Do they listen to music with their souls? No wonder Duncan Dance is not taken seriously by most Dancers these days, they have never seen the real thing! Irma Duncan$LABEL$0,0,-100

Unimpressed. Bought this hoping it would work well in my Miata. First problem is this thing is huge compared to competing products out there. It is so big it blocked part of my view when mounted on the sun visor. I tried it for one day and decided it was unacceptable.The size might be acceptable if it had excellent sound. In a word, it doesn't. The sound is pitifully weak considering the size of this thing. I strained to hear it when the car was in motion. Even trying it as a desktop speaker phone I had to lean forward to comfortably hear it.All in all, very unimpressed.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Worst Disposable Razor I've Used. This razor was horrible. It sliced my legs up like crazy and caused major razor bumps, even when labeled for sensitive skin. I didn't think it was just me... The Schick Quattro/Extreme 3 or Venus or Gilette razors never cause the same problems. Even the cheap, no brand name disposables are gentler on the legs than these. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I won't hesitate to say: When it comes to buying Bic, stick to ball point pens, becuase their razors are worthless. Want a good razor? Use the Schick Quattro or Extreme 3.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I must have missed the part about the blood.. I know there was a lot of literature with this product, I did not get through the literature before I found the product hazardous. (Two days.)I am only slightly overweight, but I have found pregnancy weight difficult to get rid of, so gave alli a try. Now I am quite unhappy, and mildly fearful, for having tried it.I can handle a little bit of gross farting and loose stools, but the spots of blood made me very nervous.I threw my pills away. Good luck everyone else.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Terrific bottle. We started out with the regular Playtex drop in bottles but our baby would always seem to end up with to much air in her belly. My husband came home with this bottle one day and I shrugged it off for about a month. I am also breastfeeding and was skeptical if it would work as well. I wish I would have used it earlier! Immediatly I saw results and had a wonderful, gas free baby. Now she keeps down pretty much everything and is able to let off her own effortless tiny burps. The special nipple is a wonderful invention that dosen't let any outside air in. We even have the 8 ounch ones which are just as good. I ghighly recommend these bottles! A+ in my book.$LABEL$1,0,-100
real old junk. The software is called "World's Great Cities, Parks and Wildlife" The world's greatest ripoff is more like it. This software is so old it dates back to Windows 95! I couldn't even get it to run on Windows XP although it says it can run on NT. It was written for Windows 3x or 95 or the old NT. After hacking around for 20 minutes, I did get to some nice pictures but you have to go after them the hard way. Unless you still run Windows 95, don't buy this.$LABEL$0,0,-100
The Ultimate Compilation. This is surely the best Clannad's collection. It offers us a precise cross-section of their already 30 years old work, including tracks from those first, pure folk albums, over very rare live recordings, eighties-pop, to nineties, in which they managed to keep their place at the throne of Irish folk, but ambiental and new age music as well. This compilation should stand at the end of every Clannad-fan's collection.$LABEL$1,0,-100
