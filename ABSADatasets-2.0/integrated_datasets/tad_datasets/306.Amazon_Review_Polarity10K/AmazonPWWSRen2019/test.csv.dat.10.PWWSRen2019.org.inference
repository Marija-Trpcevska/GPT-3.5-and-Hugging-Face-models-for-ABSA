Save your money. I was disappointed in this book. Nowhere does it tell how to actually do this Rapid Eye Technology. It just tells you to buy her videos or to see a "technician." I'm giving it two stars instead of just one because the author sounds like a genuinely good person. She describes how she fasted and prayed and asked God to give her a technique that would help people. She also includes several chapters on what she calls life skills. But overall, when I buy a book, I expect to learn something I can actually apply, not just a sales pitch.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Big fat book!. This is an all-around great cook book with nice big pictures, and error free recipes. I've tried several already, and they've all turned out great. I didn't believe I could get good tasting ribs from only 2 hours of cooking, but it really worked.The only complaint I have is that I was looking for a standard, straightforward bbq book, and for the most part this is just that, however, certain recipes seem to veer off into the "exotic" realm. I'll use Steven Raichlen's BBQ Bible for crazy exotic BBQ.But I guess I can't really complain. The Kansas City Ribs recipe is excellent, and Weber gives great advice on grilling and grilling techniques. Good thing I own a Weber grill.A great book to have in your library.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good. 12 Stones is a good small band. They haven't been together very long so some of the songs on their first song are similar in sound. They are great band, and I am disappointed that they got no recognition from the collaboration they did with Evanescene. Since they've haven't been together too long and signed a record contract shortly after you can guarantee that their next CD will be 5/5, they will have more time to record and will definetly sound amazing.Support this small band help'em make it big they deserve it!

What you would expect. This book was rarely accurate and hardly worth the time I took reading it. Preaching from a single-minded point of view, the author professes to understand a culture and institution where she is an outsider. Having experienced The Citadel experience first hand, I can assure you it is one that is not easily explained to the outsider. Perhaps I am being a bit harsh, but quite a few of the points made in this book reflect upon a mind set that I can not comprehend. Read for yourselves, but I also implore you to keep an open mind about a school that has produced some of the finest patriots of the United States.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Gerber's fruits are cooked. I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics. However, she developed digestive problem and chronic constipation; she almost stopped gaining weight since she was 9 months old. I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time! I started to puree fruits and veggies using Vitamix, and only use Gerber fruits&veggies; when we are out and about. Now, after half a year of probiotics and wholesome food, she's slowly getting better and opens her mouth to food.Now, think about this: if you puree an apple and leave it alone for 5 minutes, it'll change color due to oxidation. So, how can Gerber's apple puree keep the same color for so long a time?$LABEL$0,0,-100

The Excitement Fades Fast. We bought this on the strength of one TV episode (the first 20 minutes of the DVD) . Watching it all the way through, this is by far the weakest Wiggles DVD of the six we own. We just logged in to Amazon expecting to see poor reviews for 'Feel Like Dancing' and are quite surprised by the high score and rave reviews. Save for a few of the songs, this DVD is terribly boring. We're not sure why the Wiggles, or many of the reviewers, feel that children will feel compelled to dance to ballet, the waltz, and slow square dancing. Our 5 year old daughter and 18 month old son were entertained for the first few songs, then bored for most of the second half. Not sure how well this will entertain on our two 1200+ mile road trips this summer.$LABEL$0,0,-100

An amazing testimony. Mrs. Herzberger's very powerful story bears eloquent witness to the innumerable atrocities of the Holocaust and her remarkable resilency and tenacity. It is a testament to her abilities as a writer that we walk through her journey alongside her, all senses and emotions fully engaged. While displays of the worst results of dehumanization occur all around her, Magda retains her dignity and humanity, giving great honor to the memories of those who did not survive. More than a story of survival, her book is a profound spiritual experience about life and living. As groups of people continue to be marginalized, scapegoated and discriminated against today, SURVIVAL reminds us of the ultimate result of such folly. It should be required reading for all political leaders, teachers and students. I greatly admire Mrs. Herzberger for writing this book.Gregory N. Shrader, Ph.D.Psychologist$LABEL$1,0,-100

Well-researched, but, dull, dull, dull. I read a lot of true-crime stories. Perfect Murder Perfect Town was a great disappointment. The author's research was impressive, but his storyline, and style need a lot of help. The book is a jumble of characters that continually pop in and out without a proper lead-in. I also found this book provided no new facts about the JonBenet murder. The story is very slow, very difficult to follow, and will test even the most avid reader's concentration.

Sure To Beat Jedi Outcast. This game looks really cool. Knights of the Old Republic takes place 4,000 years before the first Star Wars film, in the middle of a war between the Jedi and the Sith. You have a fully customizable character, and you always have an older sibling of the opposite gender who is a skilled Jedi Knight. Eventually you will become one, too. But before that, it's you and whatever blasters you may find or pick up. Also, you can make a group that can consist of Wookiees, Jedi, droids, Twi'Leks, or whatever is present and strikes your fancy. You'll travel to many worlds in your ship, the Ebon Hawk, very similar to the Millenium Falcon. En route, however you'll face Sith fighters. This game looks very exciting.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Waste of money. This case sucks, pure and simple. The camera barely fits in there, the top doesn't stay shut worth a hoot, and there's no room for extra batteries, or much else of anything. The sides and tops are v/ thinly padded, and let's just say the word "synthetic" needs to be inserted in front of leather. The material is of low quality and thin. There is no carry strap, so you must have the strap on your camera, so when you want to take pictures you have to take the camera out of the bag and unhook the catch loop of the bag from the camera strap. If you forget to reattach the loop, and put the camera back in the bag and sling it on your shoulder, prepare on losing the case, because as I said before, the flap doesn't stay closed. This is the reason my case went bye-bye last weekend w/ extra memory cards in it. I look at the positive side and figure at least I can get a good case now.

Perfect. The Instinct, believe it or not, is even more riveting than the band's first release, since the mixes are more "up front" and you get the satisfaction of hearing their songs while feeling as if you are seeing them live.

Great music, but too many medleys. Tom Fettke's Majesty and Glory contains some wonderful music, but in doing so many medleys it leaves the listener 'hanging' wanting to hear the rest of the verses of the hymns. The best two songs (for which I bought the cd) are not medleys, and I am able to get my complete hymnal 'fix' listening to those two songs. I don't regret buying the cd, but it could have been done with 'more of each hymn' instead of 'seeing' how many hymns for which Fettke 'could create an itch' for the particular hymns.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Buyer Beware!!. If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt.

Excellent overview of the women's movement. I've probably read 60 books on the women's movement. Most of it is garbage that makes you want to gnash your teeth at the enormous errors being made.This book however puts the movement on a solid footing and is brilliant throughout.I took one star off because every other chapter appears to have been written by Judith Hughes. She is more of an activist than a scholar or a thinker, and seems to want to change things rather than understand them.Midgley is the mighty Minnie Mouse that the women's movement has sought. Finally, someone who can think clearly.I have no idea why this book has been so overlooked.

Blind to any media faults. A very unsatisfying book. Provides interesting snippets of information, yet the author seems blind to its implications. The majority of the Presidential 'scandals' come across to this reader, anyway, as minor and unimportant; blown all out of proportion by a media swarm desperately racing to be the next Woodward and Bernstein. The Clinton section seems rushed and unedited, a way to finish up a mostly pointless book while the Clinton scandals still have some interest to potential buyers.

Everyone from the third world thinks this is a great country. which is why they have all moved here. Compared to India it is great. I think the point that he is missing is that native born Americans do not recognize this country as being the same one that we grew up in.

I am crying, this movie is that BAD!. Even with half the budget of the original film this movie could have been alot better if they would have not used the same corny plot line ripped of other movies, and not relyed on CGI, and come on strobe lights for gunfire.. WTF!!!I'll give the film 1 star because of Richard Burgi who should have turned this film down, no paycheck is worth a mans pride and dignity.Back to the guns,alot of the guns looked stupid and plastic, And the nudity wasn't even needed not that I'm complaining but it really wasn't needed for the scene.

Great workout!. This was the third bellydance video I've tried and really enjoyed it. There were some parts that could have been better. For example, at times, the camera focused on her face when she was doing moves with the hips. I needed to see exactly how the move was being done but had to improvise and hope I was doing it right. Yes, she is very beautiful but it would have been better to watch the entire move. Also, some moves were only done once or in one set as soon as I was getting it. It was a little inconvenient to stop the tape and practice. Other than that, it is a great workout which is fun. The negatives don't detract too much from the overall tape. I look forward to doing the workout each day and do feel I get better each time I do it. I even work up a sweat! Overall, I do recommend this tape.

NOVA: Secrets of the Samurai Sword. A very interesting documentary on the art and science involved in manufacturing a samurai sword. The journey begins with the selection of the metal and the viewer then follows craftsmen producing a sword using the same techniques as their ancestors.

Modern science is used to explain the strength of the sword and the reason behind the shape of the blade. My only criticism is making the handles, which can be quite ornate, was not explored.

Nutrition advice at its worst. This book provided some of the most misleading, slanted view of nutrition I have read in a while. As the author demonized grains in general I found myself so very frustrated. As a Dietitian I am quite aware of the benefits of a whole grain based diet. I am quite aware that one of Americas downfalls is an overconsumption of refined grain products, but equally so, one of Americas number one problems is its underconsumption of whole grains. This book is a set up for environmental and long term health disaster. This book seems to promote the overconsumption of protein which can destroy a persons health almsot as fast as it destroys resources. In addition, treating the general public as Diabetics is a sure way to set up for failure.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I completely sure that everyone sing better than her after listening this piece of garbage. I feel really offended with this cd, how her company allows britney to did this cd?

A controller without a D-pad!. Don't take the "5 stars rating" reviews in such consideration, because their owners don't seem to play many diferent type of games. It's directional pad is a COMPLETE JUNK. If you have emulators on your computer, like M.A.M.E, and usually play fighting games (Street Fighter, KOF etc...), FORGET it.It is also NOT recommended to play any other emulator games. PC games are also a hard task to do.Why?Simply because the D-pad doesn't work. It's almost IMPOSSIBLE to make the moves work well.The one star I gave goes to all the rest (I mean the buttons and the design).Stay away from any gamepad from MS.

Mask. The poems in Mask are exquisite. Many of the poems make a deep contribution to the interpretation of Charlotte Salomon--Berlin-born artist who perished at Auschwitz--her struggles and her transcendent ability to turn those struggles into art.

Not that much rumble. For subwoofers placement is key and can make or break your subwoofer. I have mine in a corner-ish spot, but it still doesn't give that chest pounding bass. Oh well, It's small so that's good for me because I'm using it with my PC.I have this connected to a Harmon Kardon Hk3390 receiver and On the back of the sub I set the volume 3/4 and on the receiver I set the bass knob to 3/4 aswell maybe it is defective because there the subwoofer only responds when the volume is 3/4 or higher.

Not the Best Cook novel. I am a big fan of Glen Cook's stories and I had known about this book for years, but couldn't find it. I have ready every book of Mr. Cook's, and enjoyed most (no, not all though), but this one was bad. Simplistic characters with no depth and predictable story. I could only assume that this is the first story he ever wrote... and it shows. If you enjoy the Black Company series and the Dread Empire stories then stay away from this book.

Exactly what you think it is. This case is exactly what it looks like. It protects the iPod pretty well, leaving only the ports and hold button open to the elements. The opening for the headphone is about 7 mm in diameter so if you have a headphone jack that is bigger than that, you may run into some problems. The touchwheel remains sensitive and the screen is well protected. It comes with a case for both sizes of the 5G ipod. I only have the 30Gb version, but the case fits very snug. The only complaint I can think of is that the case will scratch. But that can happen with any plastic case and the whole point of a case is to have the scratches occur on your case and not on your iPod.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Xzibit's new cd is one of the better album's this year.. I was impressed with this whole album. I can actually listen to this whole cd without skipping tracks. To me that deserves a five star rating.

Xzibit has definitely stepped his game up and I look forward to his future releases. I strongly recommend this album.

This is the one you want. This is the top one to buy right now for home users. Some important things to note.(1) Make sure you turn off the Microsoft Wireless Zero Configuration service. You do that in the Control Panel --> Services. Then you install the vendor-supplied wireless software, and you'll have no connection drops. This is important because Microsoft Zero Configuration Service is a piece of crap.(2) Make sure you use some sort of authentication for wireless, preferably WEP 128 combined with MAC Address Filtering.(3) After you get it up and running (reading the instructions) do a firmware upgrade and update your firmware to the latest version.Mine has been running for almost a year and I've never had a single problem.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good, but not so very wild. I really enjoyed reading this book, but it struck me more as comedy than erotica.

Another version of Cole Porter's style..... After the Cole Porter movie came out a few years ago (ie: the movie with Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd), there was a resurgence in interest in Cole Porter's hits.This CD has most of Cole's hits from the movie, although the songs are not sung by modern singers (as in the recent De-LOVELY movie). Thus, the songs in this Cd were recorded before the movie.Please note that the earlier recordings included in this CD will not sound as "sharp" as the movie version tracks (ie: the soundtrack's songs to the movie which is called "De-Lovely"). However, if you can afford to buy both versions (ie: this CD and the De-Lovely CD) I think you will be able to get a nice "feel" for Cole Porter.A nice addition to your music history CD Library,in my opinion.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Where's the ".Net". I found the title of this book to be very misleading. First and foremost, this book has nothing to do with the ".Net" platform. At best this book reviews some Microsoft technologies that can be used when creating an e-commerce site (namely, Commerce Server), but misses the whole point of the ".Net" platform (i.e. web services and the like). Additionally, I found the author to be very self-aggrandizing - "I found that..." or "When I do do this I ..." or "I will define ...". This becomes overbearing by chapter 2 - the entire first 300+ pages are about the esoteric nuance of web design - in his opinion. This book is weak in examples and techniques - it is not a ".Net Bible" by any stretch of the immagination.$LABEL$0,0,-100

True musical genius exists in various genres. 1. Rock, Hard Rock, Heavy Metal... whatever you want to call it has the reputation of being basic music, performed by... unsophisticated "rock stars". The bottomline is that incredible artists exists in a variety of genres and disciplines and Steve Vai is truly a guitar genius. This DVD concert is a musician's dream; no compromises, total 100% performances by a band that is truly top notch (amazing amazing band). In this day of vanilla music, I'm truly grateful that there are still a few hardcore musical titans to keep me inspired.2. This DVD is highly recommended.$LABEL$1,0,-100

You can't argue with Early Church Fathers. Webster takes on a very textbook style in writing his book. He quotes directly from Early Church Fathers who did not believe in the Primacy of the Bishop of Rome or the Papacy of Peter. Although it is not the particular subject matter, it explains well how the Catholic Universal Church evolved into a Dictorial Roman religion packed full of pagan and gnostic theologies.In conclusion, the arguement brought up in Webster's book cannot be ignored, and prominent Roman Catholic Apologists cannot refute the claims made in this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Abridged!!??!!. Just so you know: the Oxford World Classics edition of LA REINE MARGOT is abridged. Oxford "justifies" the abridged version by saying it's the best known, but I think if MARGOT were as popular as THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO, Oxford would spend the extra money to give it to us in full. I understand things like Readers Digest condensing books for the masses, but shouldn't something as scholarly as Oxford World Classics give us the real thing? What about Dumas fans who want to read his stories they way he wrote them? Most Dumas readers aren't afraid of long books, especially if they've read MONTE CRISTO or VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE(which is almost TWICE as long as MONTE CRISTO). Unfortunately, the unabridged version seems only available in French. But I'm a biggish Dumas fan, so I read Oxford's abridged MARGOT rather than nothing. It's great, Great, GREAT, but a shadow hung over the entire book making wonder what I was missing. What Dumas-esque character moments did I miss? What details?$LABEL$0,0,-100

Only slightly insightful. I was very disappointed in this book. Although there were moments of insight offered by this author, for the most part I found myself growing impatient with the simplistic faith perspective that ran throughout. There are many more interesting memoirs to read on disordered eating -- ones that look at the problem from the spiritual side. I am thinking in particular of anything written by Geneen Roth.

Ms. Butler delivers again. I love Octavia Butler's work and this trilogy is no exception. The characters are engaging and thoughtful and the author takes the time to explore the main themes of what it means to be human and how human sexuality affects our view of ourselves. There are no easy answers here: the reader can chose for herself whether we as humans would be better off with our violent but independent traits, or left physically dependent on another but in a healthy loving relationship, or relationships, as the author presents. No clear cut answers, which is as it should be, I think.The only reason I don't wholeheartedly give this a 5 star rating is that these books aren't for everyone given the thematic material. I wouldn't recommend them for a younger reader, for example.$LABEL$1,0,-100

"Surfacing" is also pretty good along with "Spit it out" and "Me inside"(Although a little too short.The rest of the album is just a bunch of incomprehensible screaming, deafening guitars, a couple of clowns(literally) hitting trash cans and a drummer thats so good he really seems out of his element.$LABEL$0,0,-100

"Under The Pink" is her overall best.. I remember in 1992 when "Tori" released her debut, who knew how long she'd be around. It's good to have her here 12 years later.

Included are three of her most popular songs "Cornflake Girl", "Past The Mission", and "God", which I like the most.

Pretty good. I like that this metronome is fairly loud (there are still times when I'm playing with my piano trio that we can't hear it.) But for personal practice, it's definitely more than adequate. I like the tone of the notes for tuning to. Another small qualm is that the speaker is on the back of the metronome. It's nice to have the temperature and hygrometer, but a friend who has this metronome told me that he has to put new batteries in it all the time. I've had mine for only a month so I haven't experienced that yet.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Arm Saver. This is a great little kitchen tool and I am now sending them to family and friends. Does just one job - pops open sealed jars that don't twist open easily. I have MS and weak arms so most jars I can not twist open any more. I also have "band" openers that work too. But this little gadget just sits in the top drawer and is quick to grab and use. I rate this 6 out of 5 stars. Hint - combine with other items for the $25 free shipping or it is too expensive alone.$LABEL$1,0,-100
No more being left behind!. The pet stroller is so much fun! I strolled a 5K with my 13 year old scottie and we had such a great time! He loves the action but just can't walk that far anymore. The stroller was very easy to assemble, folds (fairly) flat for storage and transport, is tall enough that I do not have to stoop like with some baby unmbrella strollers and the wheels are large and agile enough to handle a variety of "road" conditions. It's terrific.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Extremely disappointing!!. Daphne Bennett wrote the best biography of the Empress Frederick - "Vicky" - and everyone should read it, as opposed to Pakula's book which is a pale and anemic and boring imitator. Pakula just can't organize her endless material and make an intimate and involving story out it. She has basically rehashed Bennett's book and added a ton of mother-daughter letters which are eternally cumbersome and difficult and slow down the flow of the book. These letters seemed to be simply dumped here and there and would have been best summarized. Pakula makes history quite an ordeal!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Caution - This may not be what you get. I am a big Star Trek fan and a big Amazon fan so imagine how pleased I was (after having bought this calendar way back in August) to see that this looked like a totally different cover for the same year (2005).However, when I recently received the calendar it was the same white background as the one I had purchase several months ago. I have contacted Amazon customer service and they could not yet determine if there are indeed two different calendars. They are investigating. In the meantime, I thought I would enter this review to keep other Star Trek "nuts" like myself (who absolutely must collect ever different calendar) from making my mistake.I will update this review as soon as I get a definitive answer from Amazon. Until then...CAUTION...what you see is not what you get!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Zoom H4. As a musician, I have found this handy recorder to be a very fine recorder with multiple resources for recording. It is also has many resources that you find in good recording studios which you can use to make quality stereo and 4 track recordings. It is very important that one read every word of the instruction manual many times in order to understand this device and make good use of all its resources. The quality of the recordings I have done so far is excellent.$LABEL$1,0,-100

low budget/high aspirations. I have no objectivity. I wrote the script for this movie. It was so much less than it might have been. And yet, Ray Sharkey (in one of his last roles) brought something to the character that no one could write, something deep and tragic that almost saves the film from "compleat scrap-heap".

Not A 'Complete' Dictionary. I purchased this Dictionary for my daughters thinking it was a thorough complete dictionary that would meet all of their needs when searching for a word. I have recently come to learn that this book definetly falls short of a complete dictionary,..as it simply does not contain many words you would find in any other complete dictionary. Several times my children were searching for a word and gave up not being able to find it in the book, so I had to get MY dictionary so they could find the definition!

File under BUSINESS, not MOVIES. Do you love movies, or do you love backroom business gossip about the movie industry?

An "eye opener".. I decided to buy this book to have a different, more esoteric view of music. If you desire to view this theme on a natural or more scientific perspective, this is not the correct book.An author who poses himself like THE ALL, writing as if he knew the distant future, as well as pinpoint our erroneous conceptions of how we see music to-day (which he does), can give a very interesting perspective. Yet, interesting perspectives must obviously provide the perspective which is at stake. One cannot just pose the question and then evade the answer by writting something as shallow as, "you will find the answer as you evolve as a race"....A sad-hungry hippie wrote this book. Yet I must admitt that it is an excellent midnight-bathroom book!!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Fantastic Workout !!!. As a FIRM fanatic for the last 3 years, I had to take a moment to share my opinion on this DVD.Allie, in my humble opinion, is the very best of the FIRM instructors at preparing the user to smoothly run through the workout without a level of sheer frustration. She gives you proper form, breathing recommendations, and a smooth transition throughout this workout.You never stop moving from one set of weights (if not a beginning) to another to work different muscle groups. I have only used this DVD once, so far, but I already know that it will become a well used workout.Well worth the money and time!!!!$LABEL$1,0,-100
For kids or not?. If you love golf, you can't go wrong with this title. Very realistic golf. Very beautiful golf. Did I mention this is a golf game? Unfortunately I do not like golf.

Hard Rock Suckage. I saw these guys per chance during this tour. They played Horde for some unknown reason. With all the hype that surrounds these schlemiels, i can't get over the played out rock poses of Mr. stapp and the atrocious penchant for writing tunes that are only enjoyed by those who drink PBR in a smokey hick bar. Rev up your truck, grow your mullet and move to the sunny coast. I will give them two stars based on the fact that all of thier songs sound the same, but don't necessarily make my ears bleed.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Unique Classics. Considering the technical limitations of the period during which these jazz treats were made, you may be surprised at how good they sound. They aren't as good as you would find on a vinyl LP but when they're matched with the visuals, they are probably the best you can get for the time, which seems to be about the 1940s and 1950s.Lovers of earlier big band will revel in some of the unique features of many of these numbers. Solos on bass clarinet and valve trombone, a song/dance rendition of the classic "Bli-Blip" which you may never get tired of, and Lionel Hampton's piano magic on "TV Special". You can be forgiven for not knowing that "The Hamp" played piano too. The second half of this DVD demonstrates what a sensational bandleader and entertainer he was.And finally, if Ray Nance's broad grin at the end of his violin solo doesn't lift your spirits, you may need professional help.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointing. I actually liked this BT, but those I talk to don't. This thing picks up every bit of back ground noise. Bustling with paperwork comes across louder than my voice and prompts a "Ahh! what is that!" response from the person on the other end. Although it's light, it doesn't settle into my ear well. After about 20 minutes, it has to come out due to the sharp corner poking into my ear. I've broken two of the ear loops. Not really usable unless you're in a quite place.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Big disappointment. My fifteen year old is using this book in LAUSD high school so I was confident that a book by an old Exeter professor would be more than adequate. I was wrong.

Ott Floor Lamp. I purchased this lamp because it looked like it would fit into home decor and not look so industrial. I use it for doing quilting and it's wonderful.

Read Memories of a Catholic Girlhood instead. I love most of Mary McCarthy, but in my opinion, this is her weakest book. It covers basically the same territory as Memories of a Catholic Girlhood, which she wrote in the 1950s. Here, however, there's little trace of her signature, tightly-wrought style. Instead, the style is baggy, with convoluted sentences, chatty asides, digressions within digressions, and endless lists of books she read, names of friends, etc. As a result, I often lost track of the basic story - which, after all, was the exact same story she had already told in Memories of a Catholic Girlhood. I'm rather confused as to why McCarthy wrote this book at all. Given that she had already written a detailed memoir of her formative years, why not just skip ahead to the mid-1930s, the subject of her unfinished "Intellectual Memoirs"?$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not That Good. I have been purchasing NBA Live since the Sega Genesis days. I waited anxiously for the release of 2000 expecting a stellar game due to new competition form the Dreamcast, I was very dissapointed. The game is better in part due to the old classic teams and the MJ one on one but the graphics I belive actually got worse if you can believe it. I think they spent too much time focusing on the teams and MJ and the graphics suffered. NBA 2K on Dreamcast is ten times better, they really took the time to make that game realistic, EA slipped on 2000.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Easy to understand, lots of fun.. My son absolutely loves this and our youngest daughter is intrigued. I guess I have the older version. but this is great game for kindergarden and below. I guess the newer model its not as loud. that is the only knock i have on it, if someone in the room wants to watch the boob tube and not read subtitles or wear headphones.Its fun and my boy doesn't get upset when I beat him, he understands luck is involved. We repick our color right before we start each game, so that don't subconsciously cheat setting up the next game.$LABEL$1,0,-100

one of the most tiring books I've ever read!. I am sure that after the great performance by Tom Hanks portraying Forrest Gump, everyone is dying to hear of a sequel to the movie. Gump & Co. brings that to the readers except Forrest's life does not match up to the life of Forrest from the movie. Forrest isn't having the best time of his life and he needs to survive all the hardships being thrown to him. Reading the book is suppose to give you the sense of reading the continuation of his life. The past references that Forrest makes in the book are not equivalent to the movie itself. In the movie for example, his long time sweetheart Jenny was buried under "their tree" in Forrest's backyard. In the book, I really wanted to put the book down. Some parts just didn't make sense. The movie and the novel were two entirely different things. I highly do not recommend this book if you are interested in reading a sequel to Forrest Gump. Just wait for the actual movie sequel.$LABEL$0,0,-100

It's a Classic. Hygeia was published a fair bit ago--1979. It's a classic in the field of woman's herbalism. And it is 'way before its time if you consider that mind-body-spirit medicine is much more accepted now than before. Jeannine seems to bridge that gap in Hygeia well before others did. Prepare yourself for a relaxed, extensive journey into herbalism and philosophy written in Jeannine's trademark style.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Marx Brothers Silver Screen Collection. How disappointing. The rating is not based on the films- four of the five films are incredibly fun and full of lunacy- it is Universal's half-hearted effort that is really a let-down. For that studio to re-release them in no better condition than they were in the late-90s releases is insulting. No effort was made to find better film elements, the extras are pathetic (they would've been fine as part of a larger collection of extras) and "Duck Soup", one of the top 100 American Films of all time, doesn't even merit a commentary track!Compare this shoddy work with MGM's labor of love from earlier this year on "A Night at the Opera" and "A Day at the Races", and Universal's effort looks darned poor.Universal needs to hear from Marx Brothers fans, too. The Brothers deserve better and so do we.$LABEL$0,0,-100
ehhhhh. I was REEEEALLY excited when I received my copy of this album. I took it to my car and started listening with the system blasting. I found myself pressing "next track" more than loving the music.It's definitely unique. Some of the songs are REEEALLY good, but the rest make up for it. Ugglor|Mossen might be one of the best songs I've ever heard. The rest of the cd can't compete though. The reason this album earned 2 stars is because this song is on it.I've reviewed a number of cds and box sets... if it's great GOA you're looking for you get you movin and groovin, go other places.

Just alright.... The game has fairly good cartoonish graphics for the time it was made. The voice acting is clique but serves its purpose for the game style. Plenty of war materials to get anyone happy. The biggest issue is the controls. They are hard to get use to and some what clumsy. It didn't feel natural to move and conduct basic movements and commands. After a while I got tired of it and simply put the game down. I don't any intention of ever playing it again.

Statin levels. Based on what I have researched/read each pill in this formula should contain 3.4mg ofLovastatins, (Icluding monacolins KA form).The FDA will not allow these companies to print this on the label. They want everyone reliant on large pharma. This formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin (thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the Balkans where this toxin is found in high levels) a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trials.I would also recommend taking a CoQ10 supplement like Q-gel which is solubilized in polysorbate 80, for excellent absorption.$LABEL$1,0,-100

a little light reading. This is Nepal as it was in the 80's A throwaway novel, when compared to his masterworks like the Mars Trilogy, this entertaining read is highly recommended for anyone who has trekked [or dreams of trekking] in Nepal. He evokes the Kathmandu of the late 70s and 80s perfectly - from named restaurants and hippie highpoints to the bustle, muck and medieval layers of Kathmandu and its environs. Descriptions of the town and trekking the nearby mountains ring true, although the plot itself is too thin to support much examination.

A bit thin and oriented to the big end of the scale. What I didn't realise when I ordered this is that it is an publication of a US kennel association. It is a slim book, gives a good, realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective, and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like "is the kennel business for me?" and "what are the main issues in kennel management?" Its orientation is toward large kennels (65+ dogs) in the US. For someone like me, who is thinking about a small kennel in Australia, it was interesting, but not really worth its pricetag.$LABEL$0,0,-100
