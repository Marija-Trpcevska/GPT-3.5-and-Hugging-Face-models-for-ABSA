Poor quality - Impossible to use. My daughter got a White SC-20 for Christmas from Santa. I hoped that this machine would be of the same quality as White's line of sewing machines and sergers, however I was disappointed beyond belief. The machine is made of cheap plastic, including the foot pedal and bobbin assembly. Even after threading it correctly, adjusting tension and trying unsuccessfully for about an hour and a half, I could not get it to sew a single stitch. The thread kept binding up and knotting around the bobbin assembly. The machine is cute, but a total piece of junk. Save your cash and grief and go for a low end singer or kenmore. At least you can get a straight stitch out of them.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not Sturdy Enough. I bought two of these. One broke the first time I used it, the other lasted two weeks. Simply put, these controllers are cheap.

another brilliant slow brew by Shyamalan. Ok, folks, after his last few films, was anyone really surprised by the slow pace of much of this film, and the surprise ending? That's what M. Night Shyamalan does! His movies are not about the monsters and special effects -- each is a discourse on morality and spirituality. The lesson here is on family and protecting your children - how far would you go?I loved this film. it was probably closest to 'Signs' in pace and message. Visually, it was stunning. I love the way Shyamalan captures the facial expressions and feelings of his characters, and while I guessed the outcome of the film, it was still great to sit and watch.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Too much irrelevant trivia. The idea of emphasizing the rivals in Lincoln's cabinet is different from anything else I've read about that period.

I'd like to give it 10 stars!. My favorite Lowen and Navarro cd!!! It has the energy an spirit of a live performance, but the vocals and harmonies are flawless, the instrumentals are incredible - it truly is the best of both worlds.

I don't get it. I just don't get it. Virgin Records lists this as the seventh best album ever. I can't figure out why. When Man on the Moon came out I hated it, but I figured there was something else on the album that made up for it. There wasn't.I bought mine used, and at [the listed price], I think I got robbed. Nothing on here is particularly impressive. The "emotion" that is supposed to sell the song can be found in equal quality on a Backstreet Boys album, and they have catchier tunes.All in all, this is NOT the decade-defining album the producers try to sell it off as. Save your money, or better yet, take the money you would have spent on this album and bet your friends that the members of REM end up homeless within the span of five years.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Waiting...waiting...eject. I've watched slow-starters before, but this movie dragged for the full 10 minutes that I gave it to draw me in. The scenery & the players were dismal and the script was juvenile: First, you invite your dysfunctional adult sister to join you & your wife on a quiet getaway out of town? Then, you cave in on her pushy curbside plea to also allow her new male friend, whom you've never met, to come join you around the campfire? I mean, really?I confess to jones-ing for some good bloody gore once in awhile, but this one found my husband, having murmured "ugh" minutes before I did, watching me from afar to see how long it would take me to wave a white flag and choose a new film to pop in.In summary, I "let him in" but then I sent him packing (I re-sold him to Amazon).

The Ugly Duckling meets Pretty Woman. Disney movies have all the same plot elements, so I was able to predict the rest of the movie within 30 minutes of watching it...an "ugly" duckling girl turns out to be princess of some unknown country of people with an undeterminable accent who give her a makeover to look all fake and "beautiful" and teach her proper manners while she's going to high school and has always liked the jerk jock that didn't pay any attention to her when she was ugly unlike the nice quiet guy that did who she ends up blowing off for the jock only to be swept up in a series of embarrassing mistakes with the jock who she finds out what he's really like and has thought to have lost chances with the quiet guy but miraculously appears all slick and handsome at her special royal ballroom party and they dance and kiss and I puke.

She Can Paint, Too!. Fans of the golden age Disney films and animation in general are very familiar with the brilliant career of color genius Mary Blair, one of the most important graphic and commercial artists of the century, and some of her best work is found right here between these covers. These beautiful illustrations are among the warmest and most engaging she ever did. "I Can Fly" is one of the very earliest (and best) Golden Books, and this miniature edition seems to be complete, unlike the more common modern reprints which are severely truncated. The color reproduction isn't a hundred percent accurate, either, but unless you want to spend considerable time at the swap meets or on eBay, this is your best bet. For more about Mary Blair (as well as Golden Books hall of famer Gustav Tenggren and many others) see John Canemaker's excellent book "Before The Animation Begins". Oh, yeah, and if you're a real little kid you'll find it much easier reading than this slightly pompous review.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The First World War--The Complete Series. I highly recommend this video series to those who already have some familiarity with the events of WWI, but not for people just wanting to learn the general history of the period. There is greater focus presented here on the non-Euopean aspects of the war, showing it to be in fact a global experience. Plus, the author and producers made a determined effort to be even handed in their portrayals of the combatants; with explanations of the actions and viewpoints of the Central Powers and the Allies in equal measure. Areas which I would have like to have had explored a little more were the campaigns of Austria-Hungary; and the unprecedented impact of war on civilians, such as the Belgians, the Armenians, and women. Anyone who interested in delving a little deeper into the lesser known aspects of The Great War will truly enjoy "The First World War--The Complete Series."$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not that much rumble. For subwoofers placement is key and can make or break your subwoofer. I have mine in a corner-ish spot, but it still doesn't give that chest pounding bass. Oh well, It's small so that's good for me because I'm using it with my PC.I have this connected to a Harmon Kardon Hk3390 receiver and On the back of the sub I set the volume 3/4 and on the receiver I set the bass knob to 3/4 aswell maybe it is defective because there the subwoofer only responds when the volume is 3/4 or higher. One thing to note is that it is very musical, it's not like those massive one note car subs that only go boom.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The Farmer's Almanac, explained like my grandpa would!. Like the other reviewer, I've always heard from my grandpa and dad that you should plant "when the signs are right". They both follow the farmer's almanac religiously. BUT, they have never been able to explain to me what the different signs were and how they interact with each other. THIS BOOK DOES THAT!I was so excited when I picked this book up while on vacation in the NC mountains - it explains things the way my grandpa would, kinda folksy and without a lot of fluff, but packed with meaning.If you are a gardener, and have tried to understand the almanac, then this is a quick but VERY PRODUCTIVE read!$LABEL$1,0,-100
'Precepts of the Samurai'.

it doesn't know weather it wants to be a comedy or a drama. The acting was wooden. The direction seemed nearly non existent, or at the very last seriously flawed.

Not Really a Murder Mystery. The back of the book, which I read before I made my purchase, led me to believe that I would be in for a good thriller. Boy, was I mislead.

Why not 5 Stars? Like Chris Degarmo, something's missing.... First of all, since Chris Degarmo left the band, Queensryche has never been the same. They've been "off." Some bands can live on with replacement parts, but it was too noticeable without Chris. Don't get me wrong, I really like Queensryche, but Greatest Hits? Queensryche is not that kind of band. A compilation of band or fan favorites? Yes! Greatest Hits or Best of? No such thing for Queensryche. So what they've had some commercial success, this package still misrepresents all that Queensryche has to offer, especially in their earlier work. "Live Evolution" was the right idea, but anyone could tell too easily that there was something missing without Chris. If you've never heard any Queensryche this is overall a really great mix, so by all means buy it. But don't be fooled into thinking these are their Greatest hits.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good for beginners. There are more than enough excellent tracks on this disc to make it a good buy. There are many songs left off, though, that are much more enjoyable and impressive than half the songs included here. Danger Street, the best rock song he's ever done, is missing. Vulcan Princess and Lopsy Lu, the two best songs on his self-titled album, are also missing. Worse yet, however, is the omission of nearly all of his most stunning bass jams.

The real deal. This CD puts you at an up-close table and you can practically smell the cigarette smoke and dried beer on the carpet. Billy Joe is backed by a 3-piece rock trio (not to be confused with a country band) led by the late Eddy Shaver on guitar. Besides the tremendous songwriting, it's Eddy's guitar work that super charged the band's live performances during this era. His homegrown creativity of blending styles and tones is powerfully evident throughout this live CD. Billy Joe's resume is packed with songwriting credits affiliated with many Nashville artists, although his own presentation style of these songs is far removed from Nashville and sits right in the heart of a Texas honky tonk. If you can't stand the way Nashville does it, boy have I got the CD for you!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Spent about 3 days problem solving, checking out online threads ... updating firmware/drivers, etc. All to no avail. My Netgear router is perfect. But this wireless receiver isn't worth all the headaches. I've even had some of my techie friends come over that do the networking for fortune 500 companies and they scratch their heads.Unless you like stomach ulcers, headaches and making cancer . . .

Poor Editing. I just received this book yesterday, so I don't have a lot to say about the test-taking advice and practice questions. All I have read so far is the first chapter (introduction). In all honesty, I find it hard to believe this book was even edited. On at least four occasions, I found myself feeling deja vue - and the reason was entire sections were duplicated and repeated in succession! And it's not like they accidentally put in the same page twice. You finish a section at the bottom of one page, and there it is again at the top of the next page. I just don't understand how that could happen - if anyone took the time to give the chapter a once-over they would have caught it. Interestingly, you can see the introduction right here on Amazon before purchasing, but the problem appears to have been fixed for the online view. Too bad not for the $26 version I bought.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A Bunch of Gobbledygook. I saw this man on Oprah Winfrey trying to explain why Barack Obama went to Trinity Church to hear that racist Rev. Wright preach his propaganda about the U.S. Gov't creating the AIDS virus to kill black people, along with saying G-D America, we brought 9/11 on ourselves. He gave some mumbo-jumbo answer that it was basically because of America's "collective pain". What a bunch of malarky. Obama went to that church to get himself some "street cred". Also, his wife agrees with the pastor, read her thesis yourself it's posted on the net. Oprah is pushing her agenda on America, just like others are trying to do and it is not going to work. Do not bother reading this book, it's a bunch of malarky. Save your money. Also, what are this man's credentials, does he have any??

Awesome. I like to carry a keychain flashlight and, over the years, have had numerous different types. I ran across an ad, online, for the Photon and decided to try one. This is the best I have had. It is so tiny and so bright. I really don't need all the flashing modes but it is sturdy and easy to carry. I like that the batteries can be replaced and that they are reasonably priced. I had one small light where the batteries cost more than the light did. This Photon is a definite thumbs up.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A rare gem. A true gem of a book, dealing with a subject that is much overlooked. As the inspiration for Orwell's 1984 revising history, it is a chilling look at early Soviet attempts to rewrite history by erasing people from photos. Watching a photo of 5 men dwindle down to a picture of one as the others are disgraced, imprisoned, killed and then erased is just mindblowing!Whether you are a fan of Soviet history (i'm not) or not, the cold war touched us all and this book documents it in the entirety$LABEL$1,0,-100

Willie can do no wrong, but this is close.. First, let me state emphatically that I am a huge Willie Nelson fan. He is, by far, my favorite recording artist and I have seen him in concert three times. That said, there is not much in this book to recommend it. There are a few very funny jokes, although not that dirty. There are dozens of simple, yet profound, song lyrics, mostly of his lesser known works. As a reader, I would have preferred to hear Willie sing them. Willie tells you he is in favor of the family farm, God, marijuana, less government. He is against smoking. He plays golf and jogs. Everybody seems to be his best friend. But, if you are a Willie fan, you already know that. And there's the problem. I didn't read anything about him I didn't already know. Damn, I wish he would really get serious about writing an autobiography. There is so much I would love to learn about Willie, but it's not here. Save your money and buy another Willie CD.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Wide but Shallow. Briefly introduces you to the elements of JBuilder database development. The coverage is wide but extremely shallow.

Seasons. This is, I feel, one of the better eps. Has the effects of the various seasons, plus gardening, fishing, snowball fights.. quite entertaining. I did lose the ability to see the fish in aquariums even with an upgraded graphic card.The one downside, which is with all the Sims2 ep's, is that upon installation the game creates an openning in one's firewall giving EA Games repeated access to one's pc through the game's exe. Having Norton AV and the additional firewall control, I was able to create blocks and I never play the game while on the internet. I had spent considerable time trying to get answers as to why EA Games was infiltrating my pc, first there were denials. When screen shots of my firewall was sent to them as proof, I was given the most idiotic "explanations". To date, not even the corporate office has responded.

Coraline. "We are small but we are many we are many but we are small we were here before you rose we will be here when you fall."

Lots of good music in here. This has been my favorite of several fake books I've purchased. I'm still new at the keyboard, but this book is challenging me to learn more chords and pick up things on my own.

If you're going the route of taking lessons, this may not be for you. But if you want to make your own way and have a good ear and feel for music, this is a great book.Since I've purchased it around the first of January 2010, I've added a half-dozen or more brand new songs to my repetoire.

HISTORY WORTH READING. Probably one of Jeff Shaara's best books to date, useing the same style of his father's excellent book on Gettysburg, "Killer Angels". While I consider myself more of a Civil War student, I read this book to learn a little more about the Revolution, a period I had very scanty detailed knowledge of. This book really delves into the day to day activities of the officers and men and brings you into this period very effectively. The novel sustains the actual history throughout, and in the style of his other books and his father's, the end brings out the later history of the key players - in this case, a sad ending for several dominant figures in the success of the Revolutionary War, who became broke and/or broken by the peace that followed. Even sadder, is that I never heard of several of these men, and their efforts should have made them American heroes in our history books. A worthwhile and interesting way to learn about the foundation of our country!$LABEL$1,0,-100

I usually love her books but this one was the same old story. J.A.K.'s stories are usually a quick enjoyable read. They get to the point and the main characters are usually fun interesting people with great more than one dimentional PERSONALTIES! Not these! The story was boring, new age was boring, the scenery was boring, and the romance was boring (which was unforgivable). The only good part was that I would never have figured out who did the dirty deed .... probaly because the characters were not very well developed. I felt that she got an old plot and changed the location and the characters names but left out the good stuff. I was disappointed and will wait to buy her next book in paperback (if I buy it at all) instead of buying another J.A.K.s hard cover just because I love J.A.K.$LABEL$0,0,-100
..But check first with your eye doctor. I never thought I would give five stars to a game that involves probably 100+ hours of matching jewels on a grid, but this is very well thought out, and quite complex and large. The designers have somehow created a system by which the player is constantly challenged in a series of puzzle-solving battles involving a fair amount of skill, but also a fair amount of luck. As you advance, you open up new areas on the map, acquire new skills, collect tribute money from cities, build features onto your castle which enable you to collect new spells and skills, etc.$LABEL$1,0,-100
STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD. Greg Kihn is actually one of the best muscians I've heard in my lifetime but this LIVE album wasnt for me. The hit songs are all interupted by him talking and HE TALKS A LOT on this recording. HE talks nonsense almost as if he was drunk when he did this performance. This CD shoould have been a standup comedy album for all intents and purposes, but May i say he shouldnt quit his day job as a musician. Overall the song list was pretty decent but I recomend you buy his actual recording of these songs not this LIVE album. But I paid $5 so, it wasnt all that bad.

Springtime For Hitler. I was in London last week and decided to see the exciting musical, Notre Dame de Paris. Let's be honest, this may be the worst large-scale musical in the history of theater. The show is so bad that I had to buy the recording. The lyrics are both abysmal and repetitive, the music is uninteresting, and the performances are way over the top. Everyone should buy this CD because this musical and this recording may be discussed forever in the annals of musical theater disasters. Honestly, this score is so bad, it is actually fun to listen to. " BELLE, There's a demon inside her who came from HELL. And he turned my eyes from God, and oh, I FELL. " " Torn Apart.

Not quite what I had expected. In my opinion, this book reflects the limited access that the author had to the people behind the pages. It comes across as a well chronicled excursion through the world of drug development and managed healthcare issues. However, the content is hardly Merck-specific. Much of this could have been written based on newspaper articles on the company. It offers no insights of significance into what made Merck such a great company and how the greatness might have contributed to the troubles it is currently facing. In sum, I would say that the title is grossly misleading.$LABEL$0,0,-100

The latest release from 3DD...amazing. Many people have stated that this is unlike the last 3 Doors Down CD 'Away From The Sun', in my opinion this is better with some very good songs on this CD. The evidence of maturity as individuals and as a band is shown in this CD a evolution as a group would go through. The album doesn't really pick up a gear until the 3rd song in the hitsong 'Let Me Go' which sounds like Creed and PJ sounds mixed together. 'Be Somebody' is a song full of important messages for people to be themselves and not what others want them to be. The weakest song in my opinion was 'Landing in London' with Seger. Just didn't appeal to me. My favourite song was 'Live For Today', excellent lyrics ina world going faster and faster day by day.

Robinson Crusoe. The long awaited "Adventures of Robinson Crusoe" has finally arrived on home video on DVD by VCI. This DVD entitled "Robinson Crusoe" purports to be a "restoration." The original film had two things going for it - a fine performance by Dan O'Herlihy and vivid color. VCI got one out of two. The so-called restoration's color is sub-par, although they managed to get a lot of dirt and scratches out, the color is not close to being vivid. It didn't help that it was filmed in bargain basement Pathecolor. The sound track has on and off thumping noises that are most annoying. Only if you are a fan of this film is it worth seeing or even buying. This restoration looks like it was one of those digital jobs. VCI should leave the restorations to Criterion and Robert A.

Quality Control Issues with this Brand. I too received my cart in a damaged box and 3 of the 4 wheels were broken. ALso, mine was brown now black as pictured. I was told by Amazon that I could contact the company directly to get replacement wheels although no contact information was included in the box and Amazon does not keep a record of it either. Amazon was very good to try to rectify my situation since the contact information was unavailable. I think this could still be used as a plant stand without wheels but still disappointing when I look at. This seems to be an issue of quality control in general with this brand. If you read reviews for their other products there seems to be a trend of cheaply made items.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Hypocrite!. Yes the book is all sweet and mealy mouthed and pink-happy ended, but why did then the sexy filly Waterwheel, that the author actually owned in real life turn up at an auction and sell for 1000 $, with a broken sesamoid bone and in foal? So much for care, love and responsibility! It is only luck, and none of Smiley's doing that Waterwheel ended up in a nice green pasture and not in somebody's dinner plate. Hypocrite!

Fight propaganda with propaganda?. How does writing a biased right-wing version of history make up for the so-called "left-wing bias" of modern textbooks? Thomas E. Woods Jr hardly tries to detail a factual version of history. He merely tries to fight supposed propaganda with more unapologetic propaganda. This book is nothing more than a novelty item.$LABEL$0,0,-100
satisfied if a little disappointed. Once Upon a Mattress was everything that I would have liked it to be. But I was under the impression that Carol Burnett played the Princess Winifred. I was disappointed about that but overall, I am quite satisfied with the dvd. Now, all I need is the original screen play. If you know of anyone or website that does screenplays, I would be most interested in finding out.I did forget that there was a couple of songs that was left out, such as the Minstrel's song and the song about Normandie. That too was disappointing.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Bad.. I would not recommend this toy to anybody. Would rate 1/2 star if that were an option. It is highly disappointing. We returned ours. Even our young child was not impressed. 1. The toy projects light, and the stars are just shadows, not the other way around. I feel this is backwards. 2. The light is not very strong, and the constellations and words are fuzzy & difficult to see, even in a small room. 3. The toy runs on batteries instead of electricity, and eats up batteries extremely fast (ours may have been defective, but it only ran for a few hours on one set of fresh batteries, repeatedly). 4. It was fickle. Sometimes it would turn on, and other times it would not. It would work with one set of batteries, but not another. 5. It's an inconvenient size and odd shape for its purpose.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great for those who like it.... I read this as a teenager and liked the dark themes, the deep pessimism and preoccupation with death, the more horrible the better. Now I read it and don't like it any more.If you enjoy Holocaust poetry or Darfur poetry or poetry about senseless, tragic death and loss you will like this. I am acquainted with a major contemporary poet who considers Housman to be brilliant in every sense of the word.In terms of poets who can be a bit "dark", I like Poe, Pound and TS Eliot, but I just can't see that brilliance in Housman.Not to say that Housman was not a brilliant intellectual; he is considered one of the the leading scholars of his time as Professor of Latin at Cambridge. That does not help me though, as the poetry often seems "pedantic" in the sense of being ostentatious in one's learning.This book has been in print continuously since 1896 so some people like it all of the time. Maybe you are one of them.$LABEL$0,0,-100
ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE. Can I give a film a 0? Awful, awful, awful. Lou Diamond Phillips is so over the top it is like he is the only one getting the joke. Mark Wahlberg, who redeemed himself with BOOGIE NIGHTS from his Marky Mark days, slides back down.What is really a hoot is the screenwriter's commentary. He talks with passion about the film as if he was Tarantino. That this script got produced is a slap to the face to all aspiring screenwriters out there.Do yourself a favor and watch something decent.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Redundant, redundant,reduntant.... This would have made an excellent article. As a book, it's a rip-off. I kept waiting for "the good part," which for me would have been the author's ideas on effective P.R. He convinced me of his basic premise, that advertising is a waste for establishing a brand. He did not tell me how to effectively use P.R. to do that.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A great period piece.. Contrary to what some reviewers might think there are thousands of wonderful, stark gritty photos, whole books as a matter of fact with this exact subject matter. Back in the days before political correctness photo's of murdersand accidental deaths(especially auto accidents) clearly showing the victims were common place. Joe Pesci really comes through as a little man isolated in one of the biggest cities in America who craves love and affection and compromises himself trying to get it. The set and wardrobe work was spot on as well. This movie never got the recognition it deserved. The only downside of this and too many DVD's is this terrible DVD-R on demand format. We get screwed while the studios make even more money on their movies.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Really not the best of MST. I paid for this one based on my love of the show but this one really isn't their best- by far. Not as many jokes as the show usually had & the jokes that are there just aren't that funny. Even the movies aren't that entertaining (cheesewise I mean).

A good condensed Drucker reader. Peter Drucker has written a whole lot of books and a whole many articles on business management. For the past 60+ years, his writings have helped managers understand how to operate and run a business "effectively" for the short and long term. But, it would be impossible for most practicing managers to read all of these books and articles to understand Peter Drucker's advice. This book tries to condense his essential advice into digestible bits that can be quickly read when and where you have time.This was my first "real" formal book on management. And I think this was the best introduction I could have got. Read it and you will agree.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A great classic book with a great storyline. I had read this book in high school and had forgotten how great a book this was. This book has so much in the story that makes you think and alot of it makes you relate to real life.The character's in story reach out to you in way that makes you feel like you are in there world. Scout was one of my favorite charactors the way she was through the book. My other favorite charactor is Jem. I love how both of the kids were afraid of so much but from there fear they learned so much. I also love how they stood by people in the story.Overall I forgot just how good this classic novel this was and I wish Harper Lee had written more books.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Release the Director's Cut!. This version of Jane Eyre is quite good. Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska are perfect together! However, this story can't be told in a mere 2 hours. This movie would be excellent if there were more/extended scenes with Rochester and Jane. The deleted scenes, part of the bonus material on this DVD, should all be in the film. For instance, the veil scene and Rochester chasing after Jane need to be included as they would provide more depth to the story. I will always love the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version best, but this film is very moving. Again this film is very good, but it is too short--release an extended/director's cut version.

Boring and illogical. If you want to read a book about being buried in muck, this is the book for you! I only got halfway through this one. It was painful to read because the action was so slow, and I couldn't care less about the characters, even poor Chekov as written.The thing that annoyed me the most though is that the writer didn't seem to think about the world (s)he was writing in. The characters spoke and acted as if the colony had been around for years, the people having old sayings and developed farmlands and ranches and old habits, when the book itself says they've been on this new planet for about 6 weeks! Flaws in logic continued throughout, and combining that with muddy characters (in more ways than one) that I didn't care about, I just couldn't find a reason to go on. Don't waste your time.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Dissapointing. Although I apreciate the frankness of this book, I was dissapointed by the emphasis on the male's point of view in the book. Considerably more information and pictures of penises are included than vaginas. Also, the woman's feelings, role, and consent are ignored in the discussion of sex. According to the book, people have sex beacuse "the man wants to get as close to the woman as he can." There is no mention of whether or not the woman wants to have sex or enjoys it. There is also talk of the physiological changes in a man when he's having sex, but none anout the women. And finally, lots of talk and pictures about sperm, but very little mention of the eggs role ("semen is how you and I and all of us started") and no pictures of an egg. Instead it shows a picture of a sperm curling up to a heart.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A very clever comedy. A comedy about a a science nerd vs. his newly aquired love interest he affectionatly named Daisy, the main character hasn't even seen the outside of his lab for years, before he accidently sees Daisy on the computer monitor, from there the story unfolds... The series from the very beginning had me and my friends cracking up, I would rate this 6/5 stars if I could. It has some running gags that never grow old, and make you wonder what's going to happen next. My only complaint is it's only 12 episodes long, it could of easily be lengthened to twice that many and still not be tired. A definite must watch for any comedy anime fan.I definetly suggest this anime, one of the all-time bests.$LABEL$1,0,-100

That didn't taste like I thought it would.... I wanted to read some fantasy, some high IQ stuff, some thought-provoking short stories I could read on the DART getting to work. Well, after reading all of these stories, I'm convinced that writers do not submit their prize stories for anthologies. They submit their scraps. That's craps with an extra S. I'm dissapointed. Maybe my expectations were too high. Perhaps if I lower my expectations to what one might expect if judging a suburban high school writing contest...hmmm...no, I'm still dissappointed. The people who put this together owe me $10 just for reading through it. If you read this then you should demand compensation. I am not better off after reading this book.

Only two disadvantages. We bought this gate because my toddler son figured out how to undo the cheap wood dog gates. We're very pleased so far.Pro:-Looks great in black. Lots of compliments-Wide entry. Others are not as wide-Low step height-Easy install. I didn't even need the instructions (which were missing in one of my gates)-Very secure. My son can shake it and it won't budge.-Requires three steps to open which makes it difficult for my toddler to figure out. 1) Push button on handle, 2) Rotate handle, and 3) Lift gate slightly and rotateCons:-In order for the handle to work properly, the gate requires A LOT of tension on the wall to push the handle closed. If you are not mounting this at a stud, it may very well damage your wall. (It damaged my friend's walls) Without this extreme wall tension, the handle is not used at all and it to open the gate you just need to lift the entire gate and rotate it.-Cost. Must be one of the most expensive, but so far to us, its worth it!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Hard to tell, but I think it is helpful. I have arthritis in my foot which seems painful sometimes, and other times it is not painful. I use the Topricin every day, and I think it does help. Of course, it is hard to say for sure because I don't know how the foot would feel without the Topricin, so how can a person compare? If nothing else, it's the placebo effect. I tried Penetrex, not so sure about that one, but it's about $20 for 2 oz. and the Topricin is about the same price for 4 oz. Sometimes I wonder if it's the massaging in the cream which helps, but I'll keep using it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Addicting. If you're used to regular super-sweet gum, you may not like this because it has a little less flavor. You really do get used to it though and it's probably much better for your teeth.I started chewing this years ago when it was made with sorbitol. They've since reformulated it with xylitol and while it took me a little while to get used to it, I'm hooked yet again. I go through this stuff like it's candy! I literally chew a piece after almost everything I eat. It keeps my teeth clean and my breath a little fresher. The weird thing about this gum is that the flavor doesn't last very long. That's fine with me. I usually spit it out after 5-10 minutes.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not as indepth as expected. The write up of the book is detailed and promises a wealth of information regarding the title. A quick read of the introduction and a little research on the author leads one to believe this will be the be all and end all of reading material required on the topic. The content of the book turns out to be a simple collection of stories which only give a basic and unsophisticated review of what the topic could possibly be about. This leaves one with the option of giving up or doing extensive research on the topic to full in the vast blanks left by the book.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Snooze. If you like boring, cacophonous guitar, then by all means, listen to "Heavy" by Tegan & Sara. But I must warn you: if you decide to torture yourself by playing this song, you should probably wait for a night when you are plagued with intense insomnia because this song will put you to sleep. The repetition in the lyrics is rivaled only by the recurrence of a single sound produced by scratching a fork against a desk, although I think that Tegan & Sara actually considers it guitar. She sings about being unstoppable, but the stop button on my CD player begs to differ. I strongly do not recommend listening to this song unless you wish to punish yourself mercilessly. Seriously, just shoot yourself in the foot and you'll get the same effect.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Our baby didn't feel secure in this swing. We actually traded swings with a friend who had the more traditional swing - our baby would not relax in the Papasan.

Isn't nearly as sturdy as the picture. Took about 30 seconds for my dog to tear apart. Took it out of the box and gave it to him.

SAHARA REVIEW. I have read Clive Cussler's Book Sahara and as usual it was a great book. As you can see I am a big fan. If a book appears on the shelf with Clive Cussler or even NUMA files - It is immediately bought. I saw the film Sahara - What a dissapointment. The actors were very much less than convincing. The thread of the book was totally lost in the movie. Somewhere so was Abraham Lincoln. The story plot was very much lost and re-written in the movie. If I were Clive Cussler and wrote this book and then saw the movie - I don't think I would recognize it as the same thing. In my final opinion movie very poorly done. Wrong actors to play the parts and plot so re-written.$LABEL$0,0,-100

She blends in great with the changes of music. For all of those who don't think that this album is great, they're all full of it. Whitney came through and alot of people expected her to come back with the sound of years past. If the people who write in were true fans, they should've been keeping up and they would know what kind of style Whitney is coming back out with. Mariah's a great singer but Whitney's my girl. Reviewer's say that she shouldn't change her style but Ms. Carey did the same, what about her. Much love Mariah but I gotta keep it real, both of you sound great. Whitney came out blazin' especially with the first track. She has great producers and who said that Whitney isn't an R&B artist?

A political soap-box. My first Tolstoy book. Tolstoy spent 100 pages developing a story and 400 pages complaining about the criminal justice system. Of all the imprisoned characters that Tolstoy introduced into the novel, not one of them deserved to be in prison. Not one lawyer, judge, or prison guard was described as a good person. When Tolstoy creates such a lop-sided story just to try and stress his point, I find it difficult to give his opinions merit. Tolstoy also presented his philosophy on the ownership of land in this book, which was much more interesting than his oft repeated view of the prison system.$LABEL$0,0,-100

My toddler loves these puzzles. My three year old wants to play with these every night. He never plays with one toy for more than 2 minutes, but he will play with these puzzles for 30 minutes straight! It's not to overwhelming for him (we bought a 42 piece, and sometimes he gets frustrated and doesn't want to finish) plus he can do it on his own. We can go over the colors, the animals, and what types of transportation vehicles he is putting together next. So, very educational at the same time. Also, NO BATTERIES, so an activity he is willing to do quietly on his own. His little sister tries to chew on them (14 months old), and they don't break or melt away either. Great price for 4 puzzles. If he gets bored with one, we just pick out another picture. He's into tractors, so he really likes that one the best.$LABEL$1,0,-100
