Piece of Junk!. This product does not transmit over the radio to any standard that I expected. I have to turn my volume 60% up to even hear that it is playing. I had a similar product from this company for an earlier model of the IPOD and it worked great. I ordered this to replace my old one and to use with my new IPOD G3. What a mistake, it is not powerfull enought to overpower other stations and I get scratchy signal all the time even with the volume up 60%. Save your money, look at other options and companies out there.$LABEL$0,0,-100

My favorite book. I read this book many years ago and have never forgotten it. Brooks masterfully spins a tale in which he will pull the reader in. I found myself attached to the characters and when the book was over, it was like leaving a group of good friends.

Agreed with others here, will not purchase - waiting for Extended Version. I love these movies, they are some of my all time favorites. But most of us who love them already have them, and won't likely be forking out more money for a version that does not include the extended release. To most, they are the complete versions of the films. I encourage those of you considering this purchase to hold back your money and wait - buying this will only reinforce the idea that they can release multiple versions over time to increase their profits.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Please don't buy this. Ok look, I read a few bad reviews on here and bought this anyway because I was desperate and thought it would work well enough. It honestly doesn't. So don't waste your time buying this when it's a sure bet that it won't work. All it does is light up my screen over and over again, bouncing back and forth from "Charging Battery" to "No Charger", which actually ends up draining my battery even more than it would if I just let it sit there.

deep end. Heralding from Glasgow, Scotland, Aqua Bassino delivers a pitch perfect album under a startling array of influences, ranging from Jazz and African rhythms, to Nu-Soul and House. "Beats and Bobs" unfolds each track with a deep and intimate layering of textures, a lot of which is provided by live instrumentation and vocal performances. Avoiding over sampling and the generic feel of drum machines, it favors quiet rhythms with an organic feel. At times, the piano delivers such emotionally rich melodies, a strange melancholy creeps in, and seems to resuscitate the spirits of Eric Satie and Claude Debussy.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Foreign talent wasted in American film.. All state side movies featuring excellent kung fu talent like Jet Li and Jackie Chan are slow and boring because in the U.S. there are no good martial art choreographers working in Hollywood. This movie is a case in point. The first fight scene with Jet Li does'nt happen til a good 20 minutes into the movie. And the rest of the picture you see Jet in slow, week, "American"(by which I mean explosions, bullets, and one or two punches) fight scenes that are a waste of his time. You dont believe me watch this movie, then compare it to some of his sweet over-sea pictures like "Legend" or "Legend of the Red Dragon" and you'll know what Im talking about. Dont buy or even rent this piece of garbage or, any of his state side films like "The One" which is just special effects (any fight movie is sad if you need computer special effects to make your kung fu look neat like Blade 2 with Wesley Snipes).$LABEL$0,0,-100

UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. The only reason I bought this movie is because I love the old one so much and the guy that reviewed it for Amazon said this was one case where the new out did the old. Guess he likes really crappy movies. I was done with remakes, they always have to change the story line, for the worse. Examples: Planet of the Apes, Time Machine, and lets not forget how they destroyed The Day the Earth Stood Still! Anyway, it jumped all over the place. I guess Hollywood thinks that if thet throw in a lot of special effects we will watch anything. Please, please, please, if anyone from Hollywood is reading this, please don't touch Forbidden Planet, you have destroyed enough of the old classic Sci-Fi's, leave well enough alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Worst ST album EVER. This album is complete filler. There is not even a single worthwhile song to be floated by another 9 tracks of filler. It is 100% tripe. It is odd how a band that was so powerful in it's genesis would cash in and sell out to the weakest level. Lights Camera was garbage too, but at least ST fans could pretend to like it. This one leaves no room for imagination. The fact that any one related to Queensryche had anything to do with this album is a big STAY CLEAR SIGN. This one isn't even worth the time it has taken you to read this review.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Starts out good, doesn't last. I liked my first Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse I bought a year ago to use with my laptop so much that I bought two more within the last six months, one for my desktop and one for my business use laptop. The mouse has great features, I liked the small "tail" and the especially the fact that the tail can swing to multiple positions to accommodate other USB plug-ins. However, that swinging tail doesn't seem to hold up for long. All three of our mouses (mice) are experiencing the same problem with losing connectivity to the PC, we can wiggle the tail or turn it to another position and it may, or may not, light its little green "good to go" light. Very, very aggravating, we expected better from Microsoft branded products.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great stickers, but not permanent.. My company uses over 50,000 of stickers of this size a year so I have quite a bit of experience with them. These stickers are top quality in every respect. They print very well and maintain what was printed on them without smudging or other problems. The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers. The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond, but will pull off. It appears they are designed to do this. I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect. However, in our particular use we need the stickers to not be removable and thus these are not perfect for us. You will have to judge for yourself how this would affect you.$LABEL$1,0,-100

I am more to blame than Jordan. I was vacationing in Kenya when I finished "Eldest" and needed a new book desperately. The only book of interest I found a bookstore in Mombasa was Crossroads of Twilight. For some reason I do not remember, I read all previous 9 books in the Wheel of Time epic (and I use that in the negative sense). So I place the blame squarely on my shoulders for reading such an awful book.Jordan creates a fascinating world, but after Book III, he gets lost in his own story. Honestly, and without exaggeration, there is not ONE plot development in this book. Yes, that's correct: not one thing of importance happens in the 800+ pages. Unfortunately, that has become the norm for Robert Jordan. If you just have to finish this series (I am officially at the "I could care less" stage), do yourself a favor and skip this book and go on to Book XI.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Full of fun. Blackmailer overflows with colorful characters and a suspenseful plot with a well done twist at the end. The protagonist is a publisher in a down and out New York shop who is offered the chance to publish a sure fire best seller which would catapult his firm into the top ranks.Twice. And that's just in the first few chapters.After that, we get the usual goons, gams, and gunsels so popular in 1950's noir. However, there is a lot more here than just a clever plot. The author understands the publishing business and wiretapping quite well, and the reader will learn a bit about both in several well-turned passages.The plot moves quickly enough to keep us from not questioning it too much. The profusion of unusual characters keeps the book interesting all the way through. And just when we think we know what's going on, we get another twist.This is not great literature, but it is a fine way to while away a rainy Saturday afternoon.$LABEL$1,0,-100
not easy for a child to enjoy. i was dissappointed with this house. My 3 year old girl loves Dora and was excited but when she started to play with it, it doesn't do much to keep a childs interest. They made one door open. No other doors,oven, cabinets, etc open. The family figurines don't fit on the couch and keep falling off. They should have made this so the figurines can use the furniture. THe first thing my daughter does is she goes to put the family on the furniture, and they fall off. They are hard to keep standing, not very flexible at all and i think they could have done some more things with this for them to enjoy.. Kids love to open and close things and if you're going to have house furniture, the figurines that go with it should fit easily. I got frustrated trying to get the Mami and Papi to sit or stand.

Excellent vocals --- Excellent songwriters. Sit! Stay! has become one of my favorite music collections. Lead vocals, Rich Currier and Gary German, seem to belong together - they blend so well that it's hard to believe that the sound isn't produced from one singer."Colorado Sky" is clearly the strongest track but "Tres Hombres, Dos Equis y Una Paloma" and "Phantom Canyon Road" are so strong, it's hard not to consider them as the album flagship.These "Bad Dogs" should definitely get their own dog run!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Want a fun mystery? Start with book one!. In my opinion, the "Hannah Swensen Mysteries" should definately be read in order! To me, the whole series is like one big book of friends. If you pick up this book, which is the sixth in the series, and read it before you have read the previous stories, you probably will be disappointed. Every book I read, I love Hannah, Lisa, Norman, and Moshe more! Is Hannah perfect? No! But, who is? So, if you are interested, start with book one.Yes, this book is different from the first five. But, I liked that it had a different flare. This is not my favorite in the series but I wouldn't have missed it! Don't compare this series to others! This is the type of mystery where you lean back, kick off your shoes, grab a bon bon, and enjoy a fun and entertaining story. I love the development of the characters, the funny situations, the mysteries, and the conclusions. These are definately not boring or tedious. They are light and fun.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Lacks compassion. Plot is very slow moving and simple. I couldn't finish. The characters especially the main is shallow, racist, and self-centered. The Bible says we will always have the poor with us. So why have characters, who live in an uneducated, unindustrialized country with little or no economic opportunity to support themselves, criticize people who beg as being lazy?

I was hoping it would help.I had the polish on my nails for a solid 2 weeks. And during that time my nails barely grew at all.

Find it.. I can not believe no one else has written a review for this outstanding thriller.Frank Pagan, the protagonist, is a bruised, battered London cop, whi is assigned to the anti-terrorist squad.The "Jig" of the title is a well-accomplished Irish killer.Frank has to catch him.So, yes: it's a chase story. And it moves. The body count is awesome, the tension is overwhelming. The atmosphere is gritty, sweaty, saeamy. It's real. While it doesn't actually say so in the text, you know that Frank Hagan is a man who farts. He's human. He's damaged: a widower, still in love with his dead wife.

Proof that fecal matter can be pressed onto a disc.. This is the worst game that I have seen in years.I am not going to repeat what people are saying about this game. I will add the following points:The audio is horrible. You can pretty much hear which individual sound bites they are stringing together to make (in)coherent commentary. Also the sound quality is right up there with a decent AM radio station.The menus are the most non-intuitive I have seen in years.Bottom line is, anyone that has been duped into buying this game: we should band together and file a class action lawsuit against EA. The game is that bad.$LABEL$0,0,-100
This book is christian propaganda at its best!. This book is the Christian whine heard around the world. It is about Christians who are mad because Universities teach everything in an open fair way instead of teaching Christian values. They use the guise in the book of being republicans not wanting such a liberal teaching stance, but you can see right through it. How obtuse for this nations Christians to try and make everything about them and their religion....it is a religion, not the way of the world. It is such Christian propaganda.

Crap. I purchased this product thinking that it was would be nice considering the prices for street glow are much higher. Well I received the unit had it professionally installed and my main control unit was faulty wasn't pushing the power out, so the company who installed told me to contact the company to get a replacement and to my suprise there not open on the weekends.. So I just decided to place an order for the main control unit to save me the hassle well now it turns out that I only get 2 colors blue and green and various different shades of these to colors. This product is crap, now im going to have to fight the fight to get my money back for the led crap and the installation fees I've had to pay. I strongly avoid getting this kit.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I hate this machine.. I hate this machine. I like to drink espresso so I absolutely wanted a machine that would make both coffee and espresso. The main problem is the machine has no automatic shut off so if I leave the house and forget to manually turn off the machine, the coffee evaporates and the pot burns. I didn't think they made machines like that anymore - it should come with fire insurance. Also, the coffee results are spotty. Sometimes the coffee is great but then I've had several times when only hot water has come through. The coffee filter holder is very hard to fit into the machine. You have to line it up exactly with a hard to see notch to insert it. I have a Krups coffee grinder that has been a wonderful workhorse for me so I decided to buy this when my DeLonghi gave up the ghost (that one I loved). I would never recommend this and if you want to buy it from me, I'll give you a good deal! I am going to call Krups and see if they will take it back or exchange it. Ha, good luck to me.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Biased, weak and with little use, but concise. I read this book here in Brazil.I'm an agronomist and I like to read books.This book has an obvious anti-catholic bias.About the popes who were murdered by their catholic faith, there's nothing.The enormous failures of famous protestants such as Luther (anti-semithism and racism), Henry VIII (madness, womanizer, etc.), etc. have no place on this book.Even about the founder of pentecostalism , the pastor Charles Fox Parham who was an eugenicist, pedophile, gay and racist, there's no place in this book.The anti-catholic bias is obvious.No defects are showed, among famous protestant founders.In fact, 100% of great protestants had enormous defects.The best chapter of this book is about Islam.Showing Islam as a result of a weak easter christianity,in a chapter.This book has some very little utility.$LABEL$0,0,-100

An Excellent Teacher. Alright, I've haven't read the final book. I do have an unfinished version that Professor Sanford distributed when I took this class from him at the U of Maryland. The initial version was excellent.

Not good. I was so looking forward to this book. For a variety of reasons I was sure that I would love it. Instead I found, after the first few chapters, that I was making myself read it in the hope that it was somehow going to get better. Its one thing to try and turn a light and frothy story into something deeper with political overtones, but its another to make it boring, awkwardly paced, and with dialogue that slips in and out of being stilted again and again. Some people loved it though, so I would think your best choice is to find a copy and read a bit to see what you think.$LABEL$0,0,-100

a very sad and scary love story. I thought this book was very much in keeping with Stephen King's newer style of writing. Different from the classics but very good. I liked his descriptions of love never lost in all the characters. He has an amazing grasp of the everyday which I really enjoy. He can make you see the characters so clearly, I really liked Brenda Meserve and Bill Dean, so stuck in the past. Stephen King has such a grip on his characters. Aside from my admiration of his love for his characters this book also scared me silly. when he spoke about Mike Noonan's encounters with ghosts made my hair stand on end.

The Gift of Intuition and Consciousness. Penney Peirce has written a thoughtful, grounded, and well put together book on how to access an innate capacity in the human brain. Intuition is our natural heritage and this is one of the best books on the market that dispels the woo-woo and focuses on the matter of fact ways to utilize it to one's advantage. In my opinion, we are all intuitives, while others are psychic and capable of seeing realms of creation in multiple dimensions. Nevertheless, this is a fabulous and organized way to consciousness and discipline to achieve practical application of one's inner knowing. When intuition and intellect combine forces in harmony ... much more awareness is at your disposal to create the life you truly want.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not what it's cracked up to be. To sum it up, this book is another example of a lost opportunity to realize the potential of an interesting theme, namely the juxtaposition of two cultures and its effect on one individual.

Greatest Gift of All. With "Built to Last," the Grateful Dead give their fans the ultimate gift. . . . an album so mediocre that even the most enthusiastic fan would be thankful that there would be no more to come. This is the Dead's final trip to the studio. Had they called it a day after "In the Dark," many may have been left wondering what would have followed. Now that the Dead had a certified hit record, how would they follow it up? Rather than leave fans imagining great albums of the future (not that "In the Dark" was any masterpiece, in my opinion), they deliver "Built to Last," demonstrating that the long, strange trip was over indeed.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Old greed dies hard... Despite the fact that the country (not just the right, as in Reagan's case) practically beatified Roosevelt at the time of his death, and also despite the virtually unanimous opinion among historians that he was one on of the three truly great leaders this country has ever had, authors like Flynn just cannot seem to let it go. The anti-FDR/New Deal/Yalta smear brigade, fueled from the beginning by the same 'big money' that ironically caused the Depression in the first place, marches on to its own drummer, preaching to its own choir.If a man is measured by who his enemies were, then the legacy of FDR, only perhaps second to Lincoln, may rest undisputed.$LABEL$0,0,-100
This is a Bohemian flick. After 10 minutes, I had enough. First of all, the visual clarity could have been done a whole lot better, especially with the technology at our disposal.

Star of David Pewter Cuff Bracelet. Was disappointed all around, sorry to say. The bracelet was not formed with the bias of the wrist; The metal was not thick enough or formulated with enough base metal to withstand body heat so it constantly lost shape and loosened - the design could be seen from the underside/inside. But more importantly it quickly cracked and broke from the edge to one of the star's because of the above reasons as well as, apparently, from not having a thick enough border/edge. Also, upon arrival even one of the star's had already lost it's blacking. However, I liked the idea; If manufacturer recalculated the design I'd try to purchase it again....$LABEL$0,0,-100

There is no doubt about its legendary ability to deliver extra suctions power.The only negative I have was its choice of plastic. The material seems cheap and flimsy. The roller-stand in the back of the ball looks frail and about to crack. For the price they charge I would expect a lot better choice of plastic.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Hilarious and heartbreaking. Catherine Newman's big heart, sharp wit, and breathtakingly good writing take what could have been a standard "momoir" and elevate it to -- dare I say it? -- literature. A wonderful read for every mother who's ever secretly wondered what the heck she got herself into. Be prepared to laugh, often, and keep the Kleenex handy.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Best transmitter out there!. I tried the Belkin trasmitter before buying this Kensington. The Belkin worked ok at first but after a few weeks it got a lot of static. I live near DC and it's harder to find a clear radio station, which has a lot to do with the static, i'm sure. I returned my Belkin and bought this Kensington transmitter from the apple store. I have had no problems with it since i bought it a few months ago. There is no static at all when i play my ipod - even living near the city! This is definitely the best transmitter to go with if you've been having lots of static problems.$LABEL$1,0,-100

John Cale's Brilliance - LIVE -. If you're looking for a piece of brilliance and maybe something a little more accessible than some of John's other works you won't be disappointed with this work. Spanning a large piece of his career and some new stuff, John's voice accompanied by solo guitar or piano is simply fabulous. I recommend this release to anyone with an interest in listening to genius with out high production.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Candy don't taste so good anymore.... I can see how feminists would be all over this. 14 year old nymph gets back at an older masochist. Or is it the other way around ? I really wanted to like this film, but it was too slow and too drawn out. At some point you just feel like sceaming: OK, I GET IT ALREADY. That, and shortly after you want to slap the guy for acting/being stupid. You know she is still in the house, you have a chance to get out, but what do you do ? You go look for her. Dumbass. You deserve everything you get, all the way to the unlikely ending.And then it's over, and you still have questions. Granted, that was the intent, but it makes you feel empty, which was supposed to make you converse with other people about this film I guess. For me however, once was enough. I never need to see it again or talk about it, ever.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A Must Read!. This book was one of the best. It is about a girl who is accused for murder while on a trip to Rhode Island. Avi uses desciption and vividness to pull the reader right into this book. While it is hard to explain as to what the book was about I will say that it is a must read and that if you have ever wondered what the hard times at sea where like and what the true meaning of friendship is like you will love this book. Charlotte, the main character, is easy to get to know and is someone everyone can relate to with her ongoing bravery and fears.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Gift gone a little wrong. I bought this for my mother-in-law for Christmas. She was really excited to get this frame, and I believe when I purchased it the ratings were a little higher. I can see that it isn't that great. We had to ship it back because there were some significant problems (it was showing any pictures and there were lines across the screen). We shipped it back and are awaiting the new one to arrive. I hope that it is much better. I gave it two because it seems like a good product, but the ratings could change depending when we get it.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great Lamp- Good Value. I was surprised at how nice this lamp is. It's quite heavy, all metal and has tempered milky glass - not plastic- on the underside of the shade. The base felt like it weighed several pounds. I like it because it not only provides indirect light upward, it also shines a nice diffuse light downward. There are two sockets for bulbs. It says you can use up to 150 watt bulbs -if you want that much light. It has a long cord that you pull out from the base. I did find it a bit trying at first to push all the extra cord into the pole segments that screw together. But putting things like this together is not exactly my forte. It took me about 20-30 minutes to get it all unpacked and set up. I am quite happy with this purchase.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Bolsters need covers. When I got this bolster a year ago, it adequately served its purpose, and I didn't think too much about it. I didn't use it all that often, but it was quite serviceable whenever I did. Then my massage therapist forgot her round bolster, and used mine, getting massage oil all over it. Since she is a kind thoughtful person, she offered to clean it for me. It totally and completely shrunk, nearly 30% shrinkage. Replacement bolster covers are not available from the Hugger Mugger website as of 5 minutes ago, so I now have either a completely useless bolster, or I have to go scouring the web to try to find a replacement cover from an outlet that I would trust. Bottom line: don't get your bolster dirty, or you will have completely wasted your money.$LABEL$0,0,-100
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. As an avowed movie geek myself, I thought I owed it to myself to check out the poster boy for geekdom. I WAS WRONG. I was casually aware of Knwoles borderline-... writing style, and found it charming at times. But this book is painfully ghost written, it feels more like something that would be in one of Knowles' precious cracker jacks boxes than a real book. I kept wanting to skip forward because it was so boring, but figured the good parts were right around the bend. I lost hope 3/4 of the way through, and finishing the last pages was truly an ordeal. Get ANY book besides this, or better yet, go get some movies to support your own geekdo instead of supporting this guys bloated ... and ego. I WISH I COULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS$LABEL$0,0,-100

This is not the same band....... The editorial review indicates that this CD is of the "same exceptional quality" of the only studio album produced by Colwell-Winfield. This couldn't be further from the truth! In fact, the band had broken up by the time this was recorded. Colwell, Winfield and Purro seemingly threw together pick-up players for this gig. None of the magic of their studio album is present here, with lackluster performances... and the recording quality is less than adequate...especially on the " three bonus tracks".I feel silly that I got taken in on this one, but the description looked great. Talk about cashing in on former glory!!$LABEL$0,0,-100
A knife to make you smile. Every time I pick up this excellent knife I smile, knowing that it's going to be fun to use. It was a gift, and one of the best gifts I have received in a long time. After ten months of heavy use it looks like new.This knife is lighter than you might expect, which I feel helps me to work rapidly, and is just the right size for excellent control-- I tend to "choke up" on the knife and grip the blade with my thumb for extra control. Its slim profile and the granton edge mean easier chopping and the ability to easily create very thin slices. The light weight means less fatigue. As a result of excellent design, this tool can mow through great quantities of all sorts of veggies. It's also incredibly sharp. A winner and an amazing bargain.I own other Forschner products, including theR.H. Forschner by Victorinox 8-Inch Chef's Knife, Black Fibrox HandleandR H. Forschner by Victorinox 3.24-Inch Paring Knife, Small Black Polypropylene Handle. Both are also excellent.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Don't waste your time. I rented this as you usually can't go wrong with Bruce Willis and Forrest Whitaker. How wrong I was. None of the characters are likable and by the end, I wished they would all die. Also, for a short movie, it seems there were a few scenes just to stretch it out. For example showing the girls driving around with loud music and smoking. 10 seconds of that was enough to get the feel for the scene. It seemed like it dragged on for 3-4 minutes. I fell asleep during part of one of those long drawn out scenes.I can only assume Wills and Whitaker did this for the money. It is awful!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Book is misleading. The photos in the book are mostly made with vintage ribbons from the 20' or 30's. Instructions are lacking. Example: Book tells you to use 1" ribbon but does not say what kind.

So why have a book with photos of flowers you can't make.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Behind the 8-Ball: A Recovery Guide for the Families of Gamblers. I'm struggling to get through this book. If you are looking for something positive to get yourself through a difficult time, this book is not for you. It does tell you what to look for and how to protect yourself, but does not instill any hope for a future for the compulsive gambler, whether you are staying with them or not. Again, if you are looking for hope, this book isn't it. All it does is leave you depressed.$LABEL$0,0,-100
disappointed. WOW! This movie stunk on so many levels, I don't know where to start. My son & I really enjoy watching the first two and were terribly disappointed while struggling to endure through this mess. The story line COULD HAVE been interesting; but the script and the acting was painful to watch. Brandon (whom I love) seemed to be sleepwalking through the movie; and the relationship between him & his son (and his wife) was just stupid. I HATED, HATED the actress who replaced Rachel! Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh (whom I also love) were the ONLY interesting characters worth watching. Unfortunately, the martial arts were reduced to a minimum - too bad. Even John Hannah lacked his quirky humor that makes him so endearing. Overall, a big jip!$LABEL$0,0,-100
666- Is there anything evil in there?. When you first hear the name 666, you think of something evil. WRONG!

The aggressive sound of the synths is well combined with the party-shaking rhythm, the result is guaranteed to make you dance.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Worth it. I picked up "To Kill A King" at a movie rental place one night when I was just browsing (as usual) for something more than the action/crude comedy/horror that so often lines the shelves of the new releases. The store had only one or two copies of this one and so I thought I'd take a look. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. Since that night, I purchased the DVD for my own collection and have shared it with a few people who all liked it as well. I've watched it several times since I bought it and will watch again I'm sure. It's not often that I want to see any movie more than once or twice in a year but this one is definitely worth it, I think.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Loved it. I didn't think I'd be interested in this movie but I ended up absoutely loving it. I've never seen the play so it was completely new to me. I loved the music and the humor. This is a movie that will put you in a good mood for sure. All the lead characters were great but for me, it was the supporting characters that really made this a great movie. James Marsden, Amanda Bynes, Michelle Pfeiffer, and others were all great! I did feel though that John Travolta was miscast. He doesn't have a good singing voice and he seemed to be trying to be Mike Myers. If they're going to have a male for the role, I think Myers would have be perfect for it. But Travolta was still good.$LABEL$1,0,-100

This book is fascinating.. I read the making of the atomic bomb by the same author and remianed fascinated for 800 pages. This book is equally marvelous. The previous book dealt with the advances in science and the people who made them, beginning in the 19th century. The hydrogen bomb was conceived during the epoch subsequent to the making of the atomic bomb and its promoter, Edward Teller, was not a popular person at the time; he encountered resistence. The author describes the personalities who were working on these weapons, famous scientists, and their quirks and weaknesses. Also, all of the science that goes on. I did stop to study a bit.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Very disappointed. My 8 year old son bought the RipStik with his saving and I we hate it. He is good with skates and skateboards but can only ride this a couple of feet. I read the reviews on Amazon and people said the product was great and how fun it was. He has tried to ride it and cannot get more than a few feet. I definitely do not recommend this product for a child. It says 8 and up but I would not even consider it unless they are in their high teens. I am very disappointed that he spent so much money and cannot ride it. The wheels spin forward and backward and in a circle at the same time. I tried to stand on it and had to hold the counter to keep my balance. It is very hard to balance because of the way the wheels spin. Would never buy this again.$LABEL$0,0,-100
second-hand and too wet. It actually is of little importance to a listener how long and why this outfit kept in the shade. This album will, for all we know, put them away for longer still. Reason is a-plenty. To begin with, neo-romantic synhty-pop is not quite making hey these days. The material smacks of Wet Wet Wet's heydays. And anyway, this sort of nagging suicidal gloom is too much to bear in A-ha, Weeping Willows, Doves and the entire Glitterhouse label's output. On the plus side we have here 11 cute and crafty tune arrangements - but then again, vaguely reminiscent of 80's new wave era which Erasure never failed to subscibe to.

Not too bad, but nothing much really. Now don't get me wrong here. It's a great movie, well a good movie. But this isn't the movie, it's the comic book.The problem is, it IS the movie! There is nothing here that stands out on it's own from the movie and all the other hype. It's a good movie, but it's not a good comic book in it's own right.Or to simplify further, it'd be better if there wasn't a movie, because this is just the movie on paper (well, a movie on paper is a script, but you get the metaphor). If you've seen the movie, don't bother. If not, go ahead.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Pass on the '06; you'll need the '07 by the time it arrives. I ordered this calendar as a Christmas present for my friend at the beginning of December with a shipping estimate of about the 16th of December, and the 16th of January is approaching and it still apparently has not shipped. In my opinion I should receive 1/12th of it for free since my friend won't be able to use the January page; along with a complimentary Christmas gift for next year. But instead I decided that I would do the world a favor and save them the embarrassment of wrapping and giving an empty box with an IOU note as a gift. You can't use an IOU note to keep track of the date. So please do ME a favor and pass on this calendar no matter how attractive you think an actor might be.

DISASTER........ I am sorry to say this purchase was a total waste of money. I accept some of the blame. I purchased this game not knowing that it was actually an ADD-ON game to an early version of "Combat Flight Simulator". I purchased Battle of Britain as a stand alone game...this obviously was not going to work. Having opened the package and reading the instructions I thought that it may work as I do have Combat Flight Simulator 3. This is not the case... Now the game required is no longer available, so I am left with a game that is absolutely useless. I emailed my issue to Amazon and was informed that I could return the item but having destroyed the packaging and the cost of returning the game to the USA, I chose not to do so.I guess it's a case of "buyer beware" and make sure you understand all the instructions.$LABEL$0,0,-100
It Does Spark. When it comes out of the box and I first start using it, the air is powerful but definitely not hot enough.
