laid-back xanthous.... I don't fear if the yellow 'glow' is so-called to be arty farty...it gives you a worry. Florida has it's own beautiful light, take the yellow filter off, it makes everyone look jaundiced.Script...?? There isn't one, just some filler, in-between some average stripping. Channing's bum wobbles like jello, Matt Bomer looks great, but even that doesn't redeem this movie for me. Plus is it just me or is there something not right about Matthew McConaughey ?Anyway, if you want to see Male Strippers go to Chippendale's or a gay strip joint...maybe even rent 'The Full Monty', any of those options would be a lot more fun than this !$LABEL$0,1,1
peerless sided flag making it attractive from one direction and faded out looking from the other..

merely the safe BTAS!!. I've read through many reviews where people state that the early Batman: The Animated Series episodes were the best, and that may be true where story is concerned, but if you're an animation and story fan (not just great story or great animation, one always seemingly sacrificed), this later set of episodes were the comfortably. Personally I always felt the animation in the early BTAS episodes were weak and "iffy" at best, even if the stories themselves glued you to your seat. However, with these later episodes nothing is sacrificed, as both the story and animation function in great synergistic fashion!I feel that vol.4 will be the best seller of the 4 available. I'm currently being proven correct in that assumption it seems, as I have found this vol.4 at only a smattering of stores, as most are sold out. In other words, get this vol.4 set now and enjoy some of the best episodes this wonderful show had to offer!$LABEL$1,1,0

Hate Crime. This turn is not a dangerous read of the relationship between Catholicism and Judaism.The Church is held up to ridicule by the simple method of suppressing the Church's statements of condemnation of anti-Semitism and then quoting apparently anti-Semitic statements out of context. A professional historian can only wince at the vicious caricature of Pius XII, a man who heroically saved thousands of Jewish lives but who in this book emerges as a combination of Elmer Fudd and Adolf Eichman.This book is about the rage of an excommunicated priest who, despite his cloying claims to love the Church, has decided to don a white hood and burn his own anti-Catholic crosses.$LABEL$0,1,1

Those who appear to be enemies are not what they seem...nor those who seem to be allies.The ending, like those in all of Vivian Vande Velde's books, is not quite a happily-ever-after conclusion.

On one hand I was so mad on the other hand I was happy that Amazon made it right with me. It almost seems that Amazon is slipping a bit in customer satisfaction from 2 years ago. Even the picture of the pump on the product page is misleading. The picture shows a smaller model than what you actually recieve.

axerophthol "popcorn movie" from Mexico!. Los Cuatro Juanes(1966) is an sue wad adventure film starring Luis Aguilar, Antonio Aguilar, Javier Solis, and Narciso Busquets as "The Four Juanes". All four outlaws are being chased by government troops. When bandits kill the father of a lovely, innocent woman(Alma Delia Fuentes), the Cuatro Juanes "adopt" her into their gang. Keep in mind this DVD was mastered off a 2nd or 3rd generation VHS tape and the video and audio quality is not first class. At least this Laguna DVD was cheap.By Mexican standards of the 1960's, this was an all-star movie. There's a scene where Los Cuatro Juanes blow up a bridge with TNT so troops cannot chase them. This may have been referenced in Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch(1969). Los Cuatro Juanes is pure entertainment.$LABEL$1,1,0

OK, but.... A OK - processed - version. I don't think CvD quite gets into this music like many others, though. The playing is faultless and the recording wide-ranging BUT it is not as clear and detailed as it could have been. It was like listening to music through a fog, with the high frequencies typically veiled in the usual Telarc manner. Musically, I'm not too fond of the way he does the famous first movement melody. The 5/4 and March-like Scherzo movements come of the best here. The Scherzo's tempo is grand and bold rather than lightening fast like many others, which is OK. One can wallow in the bass drum parts. The finale is missing the necessary neuroses.The filler, the Polonaise from Eugene Onegin, is a peculiar, if not inappropriate, choice. One of Tchaikovsky's heavier overtures would have been better suit - or nothing at all.$LABEL$1,1,0

tremendous.. I bond with this book for 120 pages. By then our heroine had lost her brothers (gettysburg), her father (mauraders), her mother and her fiance (buried alive), been gang raped, and was hit several times by men, even her 'love interest'. This book smacks not only of violence (which civil war or any war books have to some degree) but particular violence against women. And the writer doesn't understand the womans view. After being gang raped , she falls into bed without qualms with someone else a few days later. It is so disturbing that I found myself searching for info on the author. 'Felicia Andrews' may be a man since the copywright info is in the name of charles grant. That made me feel better because at least a woman did not write so callously about another woman.

And here's the kicker: you don't need hardly ANY oil. I use an olive oil spray and that's good enough! And here's the OTHER kicker: the clean up ROCKS.

This Word was a bit too surplus.. I think Jean Auel is an awesome writer. However, I think this book focused way too much on "how amazing" Ayla was in the eyes of all the other characters. I adored Ayla in "Clan of the Cave Bear," and "Valley of Horses." (I have read those two books over and over again.) In this book, Ayla seems too subdued, or not really shining through, as in her previous books. I agreed with one reviewer which stated that Ayla spent too much time explaining and retelling what all of Auel's readers had already read in her previous books. I probably will never re-read this book. I still love Jean Auel and Ayla!$LABEL$0,1,1

DMB or Aerosmith?. peerless collosal boner! When the decision to change producers was made, the DMB as we knew it.... ended. Sad but on-key. The melodic, witty sounds of previous DMB songs does not exist on this candela. The music "blends" into itself. The creative, jam session-like tunes that made Dave and the gang stand out among the mainsteam is forgotten. The drummer keeps time, thats it. The violinist is wayyyyy back there somewhere, Dave is having his favorite accoustic guitar tuned or waxed or something saving room in the studio for electric. Oh wait... was that a sax!! naaaaaaah... I think the "new" producer burped! Oh, but I did hear Aerosmith did a few cameos... NOPE.. that's DMB sounding just like Brittany and Aerosmith.

Look at the second and fourth review. The second review and the fourth review were obviously written by the same person. They both are written by "a music fan" unmatchable saying from moscow, the other from michigan. They also both use the articulate rhythm in the praising the music. On the form to write a review, they ask where you are from, giving moscow as an example. That is the unclouded reason why he said he was from moscow.

commodity Information about the Truth. I read this book in high school before I joined the Army.

I was glad with it when one firstly bought it but the last several months I've acknowledge about half the pictures one admit come out fuzzy and very, VERY grainy. ace am not doing anything different from when unity kickoff bought it, so I suspect the quality just does not final or stand the test of time. Also, from the offset, the rechargeable battery animation has been misfortunate. I can take about 17 pictures and then it shuts down because of low battery power~ however, if I set it in the dock it reads that the battery power level is good! I spent $400 on this camera (incl. the dock, as a package deal) and I expected it to last longer than a year.

A commodity book that shows how stupid McCarthyism actually was.. The Crucible is an interesting book about the Salem Witch Trials. It is very obvious from the readers point of view, what is happening and how everything could be stopped.Unfortunately, because the characters only want to save themselves, the truth becomes lies and lies become truth. Everyone has a choice of saving themselves and condemning others or standing up for the truth, condemning themselves, and stopping the cycle. Strangely, the "perfect" people of the town all lie. Arthur Miller wrote the play during The McCarthy Trials. In his book it is quite obvious how stupid the whole thing really is and the book has almost a direct parallel to the Mc Carthy trials, yet no one thought their was any problem with the trials. The book was a very interesting way to show the people what was really happening.$LABEL$1,1,0

frailty City vs. San Andreas. To mass with neither Vice City nor San Andreas: Be sure to bargain VC before Sturmabteilung. Vice City is far more enjoyable than San Andrea due to the great characters across the whole game, the missions and the overall palpate of the game. Also VC as a city is far more entertaining than the drab and boring Los Santos. I have not yet got to the other 2 cities but the fraud Miami is a hundred times better than the fudge LA.The characters in VC are funnier, the missions are more interesting, and the overall experience gives the game a better feel whereas the characters in SA, across the board, are boring and lame and the missions are extremely tedious and often times boring.While San Andreas allows you to do more than Vice City, I guarantee you that you will have a far better time doing less in Vice City than you will doing endless missions and Sim City rip-offs in San Andreas.Definitely choose Vice City over San Andreas if you're looking for a fun game.$LABEL$1,1,0

This, while not as good, can still be enjoyable.It starts out with "Pact....", which is a more techno song from the album, as it isn't the best, but good first song. "Pulk/Pull Revolving Door" is great, despite the fact that the same chords are being used throughout the song.

It almost becomes a split jerker from Leslie Ann Warren's very convert cry in "her own little corner."Actually, here, the wicked ancestors are a bit more comical in order to appear more clumsy, and ill mannered. Celeste Holm almost magnifys the extreme kind essence brought once before in "The Wizard Of Oz" Glinda, as the wonderful fairy god mother.

Color by numbers. Genius would require more than transparent emulation and standard songwriting in my opinion.If you don't play music yourself or think that the ability to copy others or follow formulas has some value, then maybe this is for you.I am an advocate of judging how something sounds over where it fits in terms of creativity or obscurity. However, Mayer has crossed the lineage. Not only does he clearly seek to write songs just as he has heard and make his voice well-grounded just as others, the voice he's chosen is that contrived dave matthewesque cacaphony.If you love coldplay and dave matthews and anything that sounds acoustic, then knock your socks off.

Pretty tremendous. I've worked through a number of language tapes, both for German and other languages, and find German is one of the pip I've ever encountered.For starters, the primary narrator of the tape struck me as arrogant and condescending. But worse than that is that the program does little to aid retention of what's presented. There are few opportunites to repeat what you've just heard and no follow-ups to confirm that you've said the new term correctly.Also, the program appears to have been produced in the UK so some of the translations are a bit funky (for example "tschus" is translated as "cheerio")On the positive side, some of the dialogues on the tape appear to be genuine, real-life conversations that have been (surreptitiously?) recorded.As alternatives, I'd check out Pimsleur (very expensive but excellent) or Living Language.$LABEL$0,1,1

It is definitely NOT the tell-all book it has been hyped to be--which is probably a good thing. The pictures are great--obviously mostly from her personal collection, as there are pics of Backstreet Boys sleeping, and at family celebrations. Very precious and priceless picture of Brian and Nick in younger years sound asleep on a couch. There is one picture of AJ in the bathtub--not too revealing--thank goodness. All in all, not a big price to pay for some really great pictures, but not much of anything else.$LABEL$0,1,1

Ichabod Crane Revisited. SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999), starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, and Jeffrey Jones, combines horror, suspense, and comedy brilliantly. This is a slackly adapted version of Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow." Depp plays a bumbling constable who relies upon the latest scientific methods to figure out who is responsible for a series of beheadings in New York's Hudson valley. Directed by Tim Burton, the film looks terrific with exquisite sets and evocative cinematography. If Burton takes liberties with the Irving classic, he succeeds in creating a superior black comedy with his distinctive trademark. And look for a surprise cameo in the role of the Headless Horseman.$LABEL$1,1,0

However, it will spin plenty. And what is lost in spin is crap up for in speed. I've liked it and so have other players who have played a game or two with it.The only fault I find with it, is that I wonder of the durability.

But that is not why I gave it 2 stars I would not care if she was all black or latin or ect.... I gave it 2 stars because you can not change a comic characters orgin this much and still think people will come and see it. Granted Catwoman has changed over the years but somethings have always stayed the same She is a catburgler with no super powers.

More than fair another slap-up Nancy Drew Book. There is more here than just a proficient story for children when reading these books. I have an inquisitive 7-year old who has loved reading a few of the Nancy draw books. (It was also an enjoyable walk down memory lane with one of my favorite childhood book series. It's a good mystery story and one of my favorites of the series). This al-Qur'an introduced the Amish people to my daughter and made for good discussions after we read a few chapters every night. The series also brings to light how things were "back then". Telephones with cords, big convertible cars, and a unique vocabulary. I love that we can download the book for immediate reading. My daughter and I pick out the books together and dive right in. The ebook is exactly how the real book is with the illustrations included.

Truly sandbag ending. The end of this movie is so well done that, despite it being an animated action film, it nearly brought a tear to my eye. Mr. Freeze in the animated series is so wonderfully tragic, and voiced with an incredibly haunting performance by Michael Ansara.At the end, when Freeze has lost everything, but sees on the news that all that he did and sacrificed was not in vain, the music crescendos and you realize that he can rest in peace, even if he never sees his wife again.

Yeah, normally, when you say that its followed with a "....you wont believe what happens" Not the case, what I liked about the end, was the excellent rock playing as the credits rolled, AND the fact that the movie was done. ace perfectly hat this movie. I felt like it had a cast filled with supporting actors, no heavy hitters anchoring it down. Now, this movie is compared with ID4, Alien, War of the Worlds, whatever...NO WAY... ID4 has real heart, characters you care about, they have an affect on the outcome. Alien is cinematic classic, this doesnt even come close to touching Alien...so forget that comparison! Lastly, War of the Worlds, brilliant, beautiful, scary and like nothing I'd seen, this movie doesnt touch IT either.

slap-up dissemble, great fib. This is an autobiographical story about James M. Barrie andhow he came to write the play and novel "Peter Pan".It is also about death and orphans: the English, as Oliver Twist by Dickens points out, had trouble dealing with orphans.Barrie had a warm open heart and found a fantasy world for childrenthat appears to be timeless and universal.There is always a place in the heart of children for pirates, Indians and fairies.There is a real contrast in the emotional approach to death taken here and that in another recent movie:The Bucket ListI think that both have good acting by great actors,but one seems to be about the "me first" approach to lifeand this one is about living with death for both the livingands the survivors.

His novels became shorter and their characterization flavourless, and in Athabasca, he presents peerless character's alcoholism in near a positive illumination.

It is so dumb why they veer the other one off. Well anyways, a space capsule was captured and hijacked. The Americans think the Soviets did it. Next, another capsule is captured and believe that the Americans did this to retaliate. The tension between the two could create another war. James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate. There, he finds the evil leader of SPECTRE has done this so when the 2 most military countrys destroy eachother. When that has happened, Blofeld will take opporitunity to seize the world.

Der Graf von Gleichen will never be remembered as an opera "gem", notwithstanding the Cincinnati-College conservatoire of Music's beautifully sung recording of this work is a must for any opera lover's library. The opera was composed during the last days of Schubert's short life and was not finished before his death. Therfore, Der Graf had never been shit lease alone recorded by any arts organization of significance. Enter CCM. The singers and orchestra bring to life a work that history has set aside. Schubert's compositional strengths are evident in his hundreds of song treatments, and the arias in this opera reflect those strengths. For instance, the role of Suleika, gorgeously sung by the warm yet innocent soprano of Gwendolyn Coleman, is highlighted by arias resembling the Schubertlieder for which she is named. Ms. Coleman, by the way, is just one of numerous talented singers on this recording who are gracing the concert halls of the world. To hear them, buy this CD!$LABEL$1,1,0

The opening "Radioactive" is the album's highlight. The Beatles sounding "See you tonight" and the quite rocking "Burning up with fever" are better than the average, but when it comes to the closing "When you wish upon a star", I certainly wish that Simmons would shut up - it's plain awful.

The generator chose Ashburton, England as her 'remote' village. I survive there in 1969 and have been back there recently so was pleased to discover the story using the village as a setting. notwithstanding it miss its credibility when she describes a busload of 50 Japanese tourists stepping out. That will never happen in sleepy Ashburton, we don't have sidewalks, and the streets are not arranged in 'blocks'. Police have not been referred to as 'bobbies' since the 1950's and the final straw came when Douglass ordered scones and describes slathering the scone in clotted cream with no mention of jam - sacrilege!

A vivid estimate. So many of reviewers are saying this toy is inappopriate and exposing girls to things they shouldn't know yet. What?! This isn't "Kama Sutra Barbie" we're dealing with. If you're afraid a pregnant doll will scar your kids psychologically, what happens if a a friend's mother expects a baby or they see pregnant animals? One reviewer said these issues are too mature for 6 - 11 year olds. I was between those ages when I started my period, I knew what pregancy was (my mum devilvered my little sdister when I wasn't even two) - too mature, I think not.I had a similar pregnant doll when I was a small girl (I'm 15 now), but unfortunately I cannot remember the manufacturer or the name of the doll. What I do remember is that it was my absoloute favourite doll. When I was very young I had trouble imagining the concept of a baby in my mother's belly and it helped enormously.

No aerobics, and unruffled delight!!. I bought this tape thinking that I would get an intense abdominal toning session, and instead, there is long stretch of aerobics at the beginning. I am not a big fan of aerobics in the first place, due to the chirping and ranting of most instructors and the idiotic and pointless flailing that it usually entails. Okay, fine. I don't do aerobics, and limit my cardio workout to sensible things like walking or commuting by bike or swimming. This leads me to the second complaint I have about the video, and that is the leader's incessant chatter throughout. Why can't they just COUNT! I find myself actually yelling at them to SHUT UP!! Which, actually works my abs a little harder, so there might be a reason for this annoying banter after all. At one point, the third instructor actually changes the exercise in mid-execution.

eff It![.]. I read this book AFTER visiting Celebration, Florida. I was interested in more background info and details. We walked down the Main St of town and thought "this is nice" but not very practical. Practical is shopping in [local store] and buying groceries in[local store]. The days of the corner grocer and little hardware store on Main St are long gone so I was curious about the opinions of the author and his neighbors. This is a bully story - it seems to be unbiased and does provide good background info on the town without making it boring. The author nicely weaves little stories about the town or tales of the neighbors into this "documentary" to keep the story moving. I know this book is not for everybody but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It's also a great commentary on planned communities in general although I'm not sure that was what the authors intended.$LABEL$1,1,0

A shaping Look at Hemingway. Biographers have tough assignments when writing books about their subjects: how to fill a reasonable number of pages with the entire life of an individual? Even someone who's not famous or historically significant would likely have enough material about their life to fill a book. Michael Reynolds as a biographer gives in, and instead concentrates on only a sliver of Hemingway's life. This decisiveness made for good reading and one should end up understanding that it was Hemingway's earlier years, as is the case for most of us, which ended up shaping his life and death. The book also provides an interesting look at prewar American society, in particular, the growing and changing middle class. This supporting content often serves as a break from the sometimes cumbersome biographical text.$LABEL$0,1,1

I read the Secret Life of Bees back when everyone else did, and based on the bad press for The Mermaid Chair, I bought it, but let it sit on my shelf for many years. I finally took it down and read it, and while I will agree that is was no Secret Life of Bees, I thought that it was passably good. It is not an uncommon fib, although I am not that far from the main characters age, and I would not have conducted my life as she did, I know some women who would and who would handle the situation as she did.

And haven't even completed the book, but so far its logical and if you have some common sence, even if you don't agree with Bill, you can see where he is coming from and if you have an open mind you can certainly learn a thing or two.

single of the safe films of the '70s--no kidding.. I can't tell you what an original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is, nothing else wish it in the cosmos and completely successful in its dogged pursuit of capturing something intensely disturbing (and yet completely satisfying and jubilant--go fig). The deeply weird all-male family is quintessential Americana dementia--the goony birthmarked hitchhiker, bulky Leatherface in his black tie, the frustrated father ("Look what your brother did to the door!"), and of course, the blood-hungry nearly dead Grandpa. Will you think I'm mentally balanced if I say that they evoke pity and sympathy as well as horror? They do! There is something undeniably bittersweet about them. The thwarted Leatherface swinging his chainsaw impotently through the air at sunrise on the highway at the end of the movie is one of the classic images of cinema. You must brave this movie.

slap-up Book. As all the other reviews, note this book is not much of a departure from Parker's Spenser series. That said, it is a fun read. Sunny is a fun new character. It is clear Sunny could easily be a Helen Hunt.The story is much like earlier Spenser books we have all loved-whether that is a good or bad thing. Parker has included the good and the bad from his earlier efforts. We see the effortless way he puts characters together with only a few words. And the way the characters interact-much like Spenser with Hawk and Susan. Sunny has her sidekick friends Spike and the lover with who she has the issues involved in all long running relationships. Nothing new here. Parker also uses his broad brush of few words with the usual character stereotypes the reader will recognize from the Spenser books.All these things aside, we are glad to get a new Robert B.

Rodney Respectfully Croons Some Tunes. Rodney Dangerfield has sung songs in some of his movies, most notably the inspire "Rover Dangerfield" and "The 4th Tenor." Except for the endure bonus track, all of the songs on this album were recorded from 2000 to 2004, when Rodney was onetime and in failing health. His version of "Strangers In The Night" does not compare favorably to Frank Sinatra's version, while the remix version of that tune is still big. Rodney's song selection is somewhat strange, covering the religious hymns "I Believe" and "He." He's more enjoyable to listen to when he's singing the upbeat "I Spent My Birthday In Las Vegas" and "Rappin' Rodney," the title song taken from his 1983 comedy album. Rodney's even more enjoyable to listen to when he's telling jokes!$LABEL$0,1,1

awful movie but not exactly as I remember it.. When I first saw this movie I interpreted it to be a straight up action/adventure movie. Not seeing the movie in over 20 years this interpretation is how I remembered it. I watched the movie recently and it was completely different from my memory. Not a bad film but I completely forgot about the comedy aspect of it and how it wasn't really a serious action/adventure piece in the style of the Die Hard series.$LABEL$1,1,0

But, I often find documentaries fascinating, so single watched it.ace have to confess... ane was extremely touched and captivated by what I check. Actually, I couldnt's stop watching it. It was genuinely inspiring to control these hard-core metal icons being courageous enough to face their demons and show up real, exposing their humanity to the world ~ rather than being content to hide behind their fame.Oddly enough, this movie gave me a sense of hope ~ hey, if these spoiled, ego-centric "rock stars" can evolve and learn from their own human experience how to make peace with each other... maybe there's hope for us as a nation?

MGM remove a new depression in Tastelessness. Whoever thought up this loathing must have been out of his mind.Technically,they did a estimable job,sets,props,camera work,etc.A fine set of supporting actors provide characterizations that are cliches,at best.The plot doesn't even qualify as stereotypic;the dialogue is inane;and the leads don't even provide roles that manage to be one-dimensional.There is a continuous emphasis on brutal cruel,and grossly inhumane situations,terrifying horrors of the ancient world,monstrous disregard for life,and appalling barbarisms.3/5 of the way through the picture is the most atrocious sequence;a ritual human sacrifice which will outrage anyone with the moral fastidiousnessof a gila monster. ....

Read the book alternatively. I just finished reading the book for the second time last week, and I just got done watching the dvd tonight. I've read everything by Stephen King and I think this book may be the best. The movie is not bad; Anthony Hopkins is well cast and does fine here, but the movie is like a reader's digest condensed version of a masterpiece that should not be disturb. I know - you say that the book is always better than the movie. But this time the heart of the novel was removed. The characters were so much more developed, the story more supernatural. The book is a masterpiece that captures the spirit of the 60's, the magic of childhood, and the inevitable loss of everything. Skip the movie and spend an enjoyable week reading.$LABEL$0,1,1

Enjoyable & informative. 1 found this book not only very informative & risible. The only reasonableness I didn't give the 5th principal is that it was written before the exam was released & the practice questions, while helpful to reinforce fundamentals, did not match what the exam authors came up with.

foiled. A friend of mine loaned this book to me, raving about the story. The packaging on the book is well done and makes it appear as if it's much bigger than it truly is. Upon say though, I found the al-Qur'an to lack the depth that I presumed was there. The characters are very level, the writing is juvenile at times, but the plot kept me going.There is so much potential in the story here, but I don't feel the writers have taken the time with their work to polish it and add depth to their work. It looks as if they're kicking two of these books out per year, which leads me to believe they're more interested in churning them out rather than creating a quality piece of fiction.Still, I keep reading them. The plot is just enough to keep me moving forward. I do see the agenda in these books, and as a Catholic, I feel somewhat offended by this. I feel like they've done a lot of stereotyping in the series.$LABEL$0,1,1

commodity Holster, Great damage. BLACKHAWK! is a well known brand used by security companies, police, and military forces around the world for a reason. These holsters are good, crap of a lightweight polymer, and function like they say they do. The company isn't bonk for putting out poor products.Mine is for a left hander on a Springfield 1911 A1 Loaded model. So I was skeptical when it said fits 1911 Government Model and Clones, considering variations can screw things up. This holster lives up to what it promised, and I love it. The best feature is that the release for your weapon relies on the finger, and by design, will place your finger on the frame and out of the trigger guard, ensuring you won't shoot yourself or discharge when you aren't ready. It helps to remove error, teaches the shooter the proper draw, and works extremely well at doing it's job: carrying your firearm. I highly recommend this holster to anyone who plans to carry their weapon.$LABEL$1,1,0
Read Concrete Blonde first. Unlike most authors with continuing characters, Connelly has not published the Bosch stories in chronological order. Black Echo is an nurse novel but it reveals key plot elements of The Dollmaker case, described in the Concrete Blonde. I didn't find the plot as compelling in The Black Echo as in his later books, but perhaps that's because of my lack of interest in war experiences. The writing is unco descriptive -- I was starting to cough with all Bosch's smoking. (Surprising he wasn't the character needing a heart transplant, described in my favorite of Connelly's books (so far), Blood Work).$LABEL$1,1,0

They seemed thinner than the Huggies we normally buy, so I guess the only plus is that you can fit more in the diaper bag/in the basket on the changing table, but the positives end there. They leak like crazy - esp. when they get pretty full during naps/bedtime - we have to wake up our son to change him in the middle of the night so he doesn't wake up in wet pajamas and a puddle in the morning. Also when they fill, they sag so terribly. Our toddler quickly learned he could easily reach in when they were saggy and mess with his poop if he had any. He also easily took them off, unlike the Huggies - probably because they were sagging and uncomfortable. Unfortunately we have 222 to get through... ugh...$LABEL$0,1,1

Benefit of Whibal smallest size. I found this item of footling enjoyment for my needs. The problem really is that it takes one photo with the whibal before anything else. This adds one unit for any other number of photos. It's OK if you take quite a number of pictures in the same environment,but it's a waste if you're going to take only a few. What you get is one photo with whibal for three or so taken. However, I find that with my Canon EOS 30D, I would gain a lot more with the larger size (3.5 x 6) which would allow me to use the custon white balance.

Saturday dawning nostalgia. Despite the overt hamming (peculiarly from marshall and Will), which is sometimes essential to engage a youngster audience, this classical Saturday morning series is hire for young and old - most notably for some of the authoritative science fiction authorship. A limited treat was finding out one of the episodes (The Stranger) is penned by Star Trek alum Walter Koenig.The transfer to DVD is tolerable, but there are some areas where the series definately shows its senesce and could usance some restoration.The interview with Sid and Marty Krofft is very relaxed and low key and extremely interresting, too short for all these guys have done together.The Holly - Cha Ka interview is definately for the adult crowd.

genuinely piteous character. We have owned this printer for a little over a year. The initial setup was easy and it seemed to work fine, for a while. Print quality for the price is good.First problem, 6 months in, was it would only print the last page of multi page documents. Pain in the ---, but I just printed one page at a time. Now, it has finish scanning from any machine. I checked online and it seems that others are having this problem as well. It says, "unabale to download applications list". I tried all of the 'solutions' offered both by users and Lexmark. Updated the drivers then uninstalled and reinstalled all of the software- twice. Lexmark owes me 4 hours of my life back. Bottom line, this printer is not good at wireless connectivity, and really not good at anything but printing. Buy something else.$LABEL$0,1,1

I'm now indue with the noesis to fitting my son's needs.. thank God I was told about this hold! Odd how the silicon dysfunction diagnosis is about mavin that are not "perpetrate unitedly" to sire the decipherable fancy. This Word PULLED together seemingly illogical conduct that my boy exhibited, and gave me a CLEAR exposure of his diagnosis, his indigence. What a relief! My Son is fivesome eld old, Born in Russia, and came to America at the age of 3. While he seems to be exceptionally smart (academically he is spelling a multitude of 3 letter words), he has been extremely hyperactive, fidgety, thumb (and now clothes) sucking, speech delayed, & sound sensitive.

Simply awful..... I went ahead and bought these even after reading several bad reviews about the cords falling apart. That was a little over a year ago and mine are still like brand new - and I wrap the cord around my mp3 player constantly. The sound is amazing...but make sure the earpieces are pushed in properly. They sit farther inside the ear than expected. That makes them block outside noise as well. Also, after finding the right earpiece size, they're very comfortable. These are excellent for the price!

Very foiled. I am a teacher, and I purchase two these staplers for everyday classroom use after reading all the positive reviews. As it round out, these are tremendous staplers! The inaugural stapler didn't even make it a week--a student accidentally knocked it off the table, and because it is plastic instead of metal, it immediately broke. The other one made it three weeks, during which it jammed all the time and required lots of pressure in order to staple anything at all. It wouldn't open all the way, so I couldn't use it to staple papers to a bulletin board either. Finally, the second one broke durnig regular use, when I was simply stapling two pieces of notebook paper together. It jammed and was impossible to unjam without popping the spring. I'm not sure why this has so many positive reviews, but I wish I could go back and spend a bit more for some metal staplers.$LABEL$0,1,1

Just Because Modest Mouse Is Popular Now, Does Not meanspirited The Album Completely Sucks. Sure, it's not their best. All the polish erases some of the charm of Isaac's strained vocals and seemingly improvised guitar work. But it's still Modest Mouse, and it's pretty damn safe. I think this is a natural progression from the Moon and Antarctica, with stronger lyrics that often deal with death and the afterlife, and a more "mature" sound (Excluding Dance Hall, which is the closest this record gets to sounding like older MM). I didn't want to like this album, what with all the radio play that Float On and Ocean Breathes Salty received, but listen with an open mind and you'll find that it's actually a good album, my favorite tracks being "Dance Hall", "Bukowski", "Satin In A Coffin", and "Ocean Breathes Salty".All indie fans should give this "sell out" record a chance.$LABEL$1,1,0

slap-up book for first time parents of newborns, to help you get through the first few months. I'm an expectant first time mom and have read a number of baby books. Many of them, such as "Baby 411" and "What to Expect- the First Year" are great reference books. However, they can be a flake overwhelming, as they tell you all the possible senarios that can go wrong, and also pack information about the baby's first year(s) into one book. This book, on the other hand, is a practical read to prepare for your first few months as a parent. The authors keep it simple, and only expand on common health concerns (such as collic). Instead of scaring you with all the other worst-case health scenarios, they just tell you what symptoms warrant a doctors call. They also break things down into a lot of detail- how to swaddle, how to bathe, how to change a diaper while giving you tons of useful tips that I haven't seen in any other book.$LABEL$1,1,0

This script has the better picture in the whole series.... In Novemeber 1997 in Orinda CA, on a book tour for her latest Niccolo book, I had the pleasure to hear Dorothy Dunnett read aloud the "Revels" scene (essentially the last part of Part Three, Chapter 9 from The Ringed Castle) which is my favorite scene in the entire series. She is truly a remarkable woman, yet hearty at 75, with a wit and intelligence rarely scene in real life. She told us she reads numerous (sometimes hundreds!) of history books before writing each novel to make sure that nothing in the novels contradicts anything from known history. She has created in the Lymond Chronicles the best historical fiction I have ever read, and the most compelling fiction of any genre I have ever read. When she does her book tour for the final Niccolo book in 2000, be sure to go see her--it may be your last chance to see one of the most remarkable women authors of the twentieth century.$LABEL$1,1,0

Another What-If record. Since Elaine Pagels' Gnostic Gospels there has been a steady stream of books written on the subject of lost options in Christianity. This is a particularly forged exemplar of that genre because it wangle the substance and nature of almost every heresy and threat it proposes to assess. Especially unaccented is Ehrman's handling of Marcionism which he fundamentally misunderstands and seems to know only from the dated studies of Knox and Harnack. His idea that Marcion's view of God was too "new" for the church to accept is based on a howling anachronism in the dating of Marcion's heresy. In fact there is plenty to suggest that Marcion's solitary gospel and limited collection of Paul's letters corresponded to (and resonated with) the most ancient inclinations of Christian theology. In short, not only yet another case of popularization but a bad job of reading the evidence as well.$LABEL$0,1,1

perturbing, but for different understanding. An accounting of an American intellectual who submerges himself in the common rubble to learn their horrible violent, racist ways. Interestingly, each chapter is preceded by a small clippet from Victorian accounts that define and demonize the mob, i.e., the working people. Equally disturbing are author's metaphors that consistently compare people with animals. This hold is overstated and indeed fancied for the most divide. come violence occur during football matches--yes it does. But the author makes no attempt to explain this behaviour on a personal level; he views it as mob mentality. Furthermore, it downright insulting to the British public, which may or may not be a good thing. It is interesting, but the tone of the book is not objective--it's an elitist account, written in inflated diction, of an upper class professional "trying" to understand the vulgar culture of the masses--culture that is made of thugs, Nazis, and alcoholics, according to the writer.$LABEL$0,1,1

sour luff. The Killing Dance held a true appeal in its romance and relationship issues for Anita. The plot of Sabin, Dumane and Cassandra however was wasted in an attempt to throw Anita and Jean-Claude's relationship into a more mature level. I feel that the older triumvirate could have been more developed as characters, in order to give more groundwork to the Richard, Jean-Claude and Anita triangle. Hamilton tends to let the deeper plot overtake the relationships sometimes, but in The Killing Dance, she put way too much focus on Anita finally choosing between her two preternatural boyfriends. The powerful ending helped draw together the novel, and especially with the reconnection between the three main characters. All in all, the book was extremely entertaining, and Anita is now going to have to face a maturity which she has not had previously.$LABEL$1,1,0

disappoint. This is a gracious depend unit, although the knobs are poorly styled compared to the rest of the exterior. The knobs are also not particularly good ergonomically. And those are the good parts. As many other commentator have celebrated, the unit does go off at times for no reason and makes a continuous noise akin to a smoke alarm, only not as brassy. In the middle of the night, this can be a little enervate. The superlative is not properly insulated, so it gets very hot during operation. The toaster rack does not get pulled out when the door is opened. You need to reach in, which is not as safe as the alternative. The bottom tray is plain steel, not polished stainless, like others in this price range. It does not have a door in the bottom for emptying crumbs.

Perhaps this is 'intellectually challenging' for some in college art class,,but this old technique just seems to go on forever. I liked the acting - I liked the visuals.

Didn't mostly forethought for the sign Ruffalo character, but liked all the other participants.

slap-up for the price! Few "VERY" minor flaws.. I bought this product for my mother and my mother-in-law. It has a picture that looks great from far, but is far from great. If you're 5 feet away or more, you will not notice the pixelation. As you get closer, however, you will start noticing every pixel on the picture. The transfer of images is simple and the speaker is a good addition. The speaker isn't the greatest, but how many picture frames do you know that have a speaker, it's not for music videos, it's for pictures.Overall: Great gift idea, and if you want perfection, go ahead and spend that $150-$200 on another 7" frame.

sour alright. The sound quality doesn't seem to be much better than with the italk alone, BUT, on the plus side, it cuts down any harddrive noise from your ipod that gets picked up by the italk sometimes. I use mine for lectures in a relatively large lecture hall and the professor doesn't use a mic. When they do, the sound is great. I only have to turn up my volume about 3/4 for the sound to be good, but when they don't, I have to sit near the front and turn the volume up all the way. My advice would be to buy the italk by itself (or any other voice recorder, it's the only one I've used and I like it) and try it out. If the noise of the harddrive bothers you, THEN get the mic.$LABEL$1,1,0

tedious, but brainy. Many of the other reviewers have complained that this book moves too slowly. If you go into it expecting a rollicking adventure, then you'll be disappointed. This is not a novel of swords and sorcery. It's not something that you could pull from transcripts of your last D&D; campaign. And that is very much in its favor.Stevermer has painted a picture of the life of her main character. She is not your typical fantasy heroine, nor is she a wilting flower waiting to be saved by the big strong men. She's an individual, and the joy of the book is learning about Hail.The book expects more of you, too. Unless you're familiar with Renaissance Europe, and have a more than passing acquaintance with the Arthurian legends, you'll find many of the references obtuse. But for the rest of us, Caroline Stevermer has given us a rich world full of memorable characters, and my only disappointment is that the book was too short.$LABEL$1,1,0

Serve with port, glowing coal and your frump nearby.... With the publication of Modern Pheasant Hunting, in 1982, outdoor writer Steve Grooms told us how he hunts pheasants. In Pheasant Hunter's harvest, he tells us why. Too recollective in coming, it is a book that was well deserving the postponement, reflecting maturation in Grooms' prose and appreciation of his subject. Along with Datus C. Proper's Pheasants of the Mind, it is one of two volumes that goes to the heart of pheasant hunting with eloquence and understanding, and stands ahead of all others. Served at the hearth with a glass of port and a trusty pointer or retriever nearby, it is a book that can be consumed over and over again, reminding us that why we hunt is more important than how. Currently out of print, it is that rare work that deserves a place in every upland bird hunter's library, and if not in their library, in the glove compartment of their pick-up truck.$LABEL$1,1,0

For those who believe the Bible is 100% misprint (it isn't) and who dwell on suffering self abuse, this Book will help check disperate and unrelated turn of shaky history into a predetermined and particularly ideological mold they may feel comfortable being poured into.simply it is a history of a very STAID and stagnant Jesus--something he or what he taught was NOT. He was a radical bighearted (even the New Testemant--written centuries after Christ's death admits to this), who challanged notions of church bound hierarchy's.It's a shame that organizational religion (like the Southern Baptist Convention) promotes disdain for what Jesus taught--individual personal relationship with Jesus and God.

the amazing trance. Quite a stunning bit of workmanship - the masterminds behind it have certainly produced an album worth buying. A very good all-around record; dance to it, play it in the background, sit down and listen to it intently. Nice long tracks with no commercial interruptions, beautiful spacy/ earthy/ underwater sound waves laid on top of a solid, moving bass & drum. Absolutely altogether a grotesque misstep into elsewhere.$LABEL$1,1,0

obliterate copper affects many people!. This book brings scant to a relatively unknown topic of health concern- high tissue copper. I learned what the dangers of copper toxicity are, as well as the symptoms. I also read which foods are high in copper, and different ways to chelate copper out of your system. Everyone should know about the copper connection! Especially anyone with chronic fatigue syndrome or hormone imbalance!$LABEL$1,1,0
Never Again. I've owned this specific design as comfortably as another design from this brand. The first I bought and the second was a gift. But if I ever receive this brand as a gift again, I will do everything I can to rejoin it. Both sets soften so easily. I had a bunch of plates break while in the dishwasher. Other plates broke while being eaten off of. One broke while my boyfriend was eating a waffle off of it! A waffle! So it's not like it takes excessive force to damage these things. They just break right down the center every time. Plus, the bowls and mugs get EXTREMELY HOT just after a couple of minutes in the microwave. If you scratch off the paint, you can see a shiny, metallic surface underneath. I've read the other reviews where people have had no problems at all. I guess luck is just involved. But I wouldn't recommend taking the chance on these plates unless you have the money to throw away.$LABEL$0,1,1
Re-Packaged New Age Nonesense at the Expense of the Faithful. Editing review - I did not intend to give five stars but ONE star. Full disclosure, when I first read this book, I thought it was great. But that was when I didn't know any better. Today, I can tell you that this is one of the most inauthentic primers of our faith out today. It claims to promote and praise ony branch of faith (Traditional Yoruba), while mocking another (Santeria), but then offers what is basically thinly veiled Santeria. His explanations and descriptions are out of the New Age cliche catalog. If you are just starting your journey to Orisa, pick up Joseph Murphy , Wande Abimbola or just about anybody else. NOT THIS BOOK. santeria.blog.com$LABEL$1,1,0
Only one result. I really like the business card holder as I purchased the black leather one. The arrival time was very quick. It's quality and very nice. I ordered it because it suppose hold up to 120 business card with one extra slot and mine didn't seem to have those options. I can only fit 72 cards in there and that is doubling each insert and that's my only issue with it.$LABEL$1,1,0

perfectly Battery. Brita lack to increase landfill and languish by having you throw away your 5 year-old pitchers because that's how long the battery is supposed to last in the filter replacement timers on these and similar units.

Fragile and TINY. Ok so bad me for not appreciating this book is only about 1.5 inches square... very humble! Cute, but toughie to cover. More importantly, my toddler ripped the cover off on day two - and she is generally gentle with books. Cute but very tiny and fragile. It's also hard to know what captions go with what, so thought-provoking to associate the text with the appropriate animal.$LABEL$0,1,1
Bought trio, two have bomb!!. I was introduced to Tivoli by my brother who had a early model PAL radio. Bought two SongBooks for myself and one as a gift for my father-in-law. Really not happy with these radios. The sound is mediocre at best and I would say better for listening to talk radio than music. The blue SongBook (I bought red and blue ones) has the worst sticky culture on it and its impossible to unobjectionable and feels disgusting to pick up. The REAL reason I have to give it such a low rating is failure rate. One of mine died completely and had to be shipped back to Tivoli. My father-in-laws did the same thing and they blamed it on a faulty power cord but would not ship him a new one until he shipped them the radio and cord for assessment (and the courier charge was not covered).Finally, don't let these radios sit in the sun as they overheat and shut down. We use them by our pool but have to put them in the shade under a chair or else they fail in about 30 minutes.I would not buy another.$LABEL$0,1,1
Good expansion, but very inadequate. Rainbow Six: Eagle Watch is really a good expansion set for the original Rainbow Six. It only has 5 mission though. Even though it only has 5 missions, they are pretty hard, and they take place in famous places, like Big Ben in London, the US Capitol Building, and the Taj Mahal in India. There are 3 new weapons, and they are the Heckler & Koch G36K, the Heckler & Koch G3A3 assault rifles. Also, it includes the IMI .50 caliber Desert Eagle, which can kill anyone in one hit (usually).Even though it is short, it is a really good expansion for the first Rainbow Six game.$LABEL$1,1,0

sweetener and Switch. I attended a showing of this movie and was a little put off by the rabid intensity with which it was received. During an after show Q and A, any criticisms were booed, and people not completely embracing the film-makers' belief-system were branded close-minded and victims of a biased western educational world-view.I won't blindly follow anyone and did not appreciate this kind of mob rules mentality. Before closing people were encouraged to post on message, news-groups, and review-boards as often as possible.This movie was a jumbled mess. I think it's true purpose can be exposed by the many other products and services being offered under the What The Bleep Umbrella. . .Interestingly enough if one follows the money it leads to the door of a 35,000 year old spirit from Atlantis named Ramtha. This franchise has just taken it to the next level.$LABEL$0,1,1

Beacuse the nightmare films have ended, the 'real' Freddy decides to come to our world. Wes Craven, Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, toilet Saxon are some of Freddy's targets he tries to kill. He tries to convey Heather's son, Dylan too. The real Freddy is a mess scarier and more evil than Robert Englund could ever portray!

thwarted. world-class to start out with, I'd like to say that Dee Henderson is an amazing writer w/ the special gift of writing. one would not urge this al-Qur'an. The other books she has written (O'Malley Series, Danger in the Shadows) were very well written, w/ the feeling that your can't turn the pages fast enough because it's so good. Unlike the others, True Valor was slow read, and I found my self skimming and completely skipping whole pharagraghs. But even tho I don't recommend this book, the others books by Dee Henderson I HIGHLY recommend.$LABEL$0,1,1

It's easy for the elderly (and non-technical people) to role, it's compact and doesn't use much counter space. I highly recommend it for the damage.$LABEL$1,1,0
Filth, Porn, totally wicked movie. This is possibly the most revolt pornographic movie ever score, which tries to mystify people interested in ancient Roman history to buy it. It is zip but vivid hedonistic porn from start to finish. It's a slick way for the porn industry to spread their filth where it otherwise would not be able to. If you are a Christian, stay very far from this movie. It will sicken you as it did me.I corrupt it only because Peter O'toole is in it. I cannot for the life of me imagine why Peter O'toole agreed to be in this filthy movie.I have marked on this movie case: smut, porn, filth; not worth watching.$LABEL$0,1,1
