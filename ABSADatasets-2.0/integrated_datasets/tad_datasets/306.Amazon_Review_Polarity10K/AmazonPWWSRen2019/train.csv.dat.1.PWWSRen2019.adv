Regression. I wasn't sure how this cd would work. I bought it with my fingers crossed that it would. I live in a place where therapists don't offer this sort of thing. So, it was my last resort. I've tried it 2 times now and both times, it sour! My body was put into deep relaxation...not sure my body has ever been so relaxed!One thing that many don't understand about Past-Life Regressions is that you see past lives and you see the death. It can be a very educational thing for us as long as we don't view this instance as a part of our current life. There is separation there and it needs to be there. If you see yourself in a way that is painful to watch, it's okay. Learn from it. Move on. There's no reason to claim any of the emotions or instances as your own now.Past-Life Regressions can help us recognize those parts of us that we don't quite understand.

The only persona this album plays in music history is to serve, like the Wedding Album, as a dire warning to all of how awful the results can be when artistic pretentiousness prevails over good judgement and true creativity.

clean superficial. If you are looking for an overview of the causes of infertility, or are newly diagnosed with infertility, this power be a useful reserve. If you are an infertility patient you probably already know most of what is in it - for example it covers the testing that is done to determine causes of infertility.If you are looking for a really good explanation of how your body works, and how you can maximize your chances of getting pregnant, receive Toni Weschler's "Taking Charge of Your Fertility". It's much more thorough and complete description of how you can increase your chances of getting pregnant.The section on mind/body is really stress reduction techniques, which are available in many other places. Infertility causes stress, and stress aggravates infertility, so stress reduction and coping strategies matter.

I bought it just for "A cowboy's born with a broken heart", expecting the rest to be in the same vein (at least the titles looked promissing). I don't know how the other albums by this band sound, but this is pathetic. You can hardly call this country music by any standard. The first couple of tracks sound more like "praise songs", the harmonies are almost gospel-like. The only tracks bearable are "In another tear from now", "If her heart ain't in Memphis" and the forementioned "A cowboy's born ...". Only the latter is really good, the other two being ruined somewhere down the line.

Just Wait A Second. When people are saying this is the best chintzy album ever, that's quite ridiculous. I know there are at least two NoFX albums that are much better than this. "Ribbed" and the album everyone hates because it's raw "Liberal Animation". I read a review for this album that said My Hear Is Yearning an opera was 10/10 because of diversity! WTF! I didn't pick this cd up for an opera song, or a folk song. It's called diversity in a PUNK song. Diversity doesn't always meen a different genre, it can also meen a different style of punk. I also disagree when people say that this album get's five stars because sometimes you can't understand what the lead singer is saying.Well this cd really is good, but I'm sick of people saying this is the best cd because there is one diverse opera song.Best songs- Linoleum/Jeff Wears Birkenstocks/ Punk Guy$LABEL$1,1,0
JAMES BOND miss. Why do most of John Gardner's James Bond novels seem like screenplays? I think that is what was always missing from his writings. Because they were similar to screenplays they read like movie scripts, not novels. It just leaves the reader so uninvolved.

Lacking in the staple. angstrom with most pose books, there is a severe lack of detail and contrast in the photos. The purpose of this book is to provide an alternative to life drawing, but go in the very aspect of life draught that makes it so effective. With such poor photography, it is extremely difficult to discern the surface features that are so important to learning artistic human anatomy. While the poses have a slightly more natural bend than most books in this genre, there is still an unnatural stiffness, or exaggeration of movement that is rarely every desired in figure references. In addition, all of the models are young college age people, with little or no ethnic diversity.The overall direction of this book attempts to provide the artist with a holistic smattering of references in anatomy, movement and lighting, but fails in all three catagories, badly. I don't recommend this book to anyone with serious ambitions in learning to draw the human figure.$LABEL$0,1,1

In preparation on a column that I am doing for middle and teen readers on espionage, I picked this title up at the library on the recommendation of the young adult librarian. What a great suggestion! Allen does a grotesque job of leading the reader through the incredible story of spying, double agents, and treason during the Revolutionary War. This book has it all - invisible ink, disguises, codebooks, hidden messages, and more. And readers are invited to test themselves at decoding, using a "mask", and other spy talents. Recommended for school use in American History units, and for anyone (gr 4 and up) that is looking for something really different and entertaining, while being completely factual!

adenine seminal sour in international relations. Many criticisms to Waltz's work are unfounded, in that the book is not intended to be an end all for explaining wars in international relations. It does however, provide the reader with a theoretical framework of international relations. The three images of analysis provide for a generalization of the system in which war is promulgated. This book and a bevy of later works argue what level of analysis is best at explicating the cause of war.

Two Large Baoxers eff this bed. We have had this bed for a couple of weeks now and both our boxers (one 95lb and one 75lb) love it. We use it inside and put a small blanket on it. The cover alone seemed a little rough. I love it because I can vac all around and under it, instead of having to move the dog bed every time I vac. I rated it a four star because it arrived with missing parts. I called the factory and they immediately sent the part to me. It was just a matter of having to wait the extra week. It does take up quit a bit of room, but hey, it's a large bed for large dogs. I had no big problem putting it together and so far see no bending of the frame, possibly a slight sag in the material although the dogs are still elevated off the floor even when both of them are on the bed at the same time.

Protector of the Small #3- Squire. I actually thought this book was better then the one before it (Page) which surprised me as usually I find in Tamora Pierce's quartets the first book is the best, then they get slowly a little worse each time. But even though Kel wasn't working aound the palace any more, this book was soundless really intresting and it was great that it was a mess longer then the first two books. I have one complaint: Cleon. ....Otherwise the book was brilliant. I loved all the bits with jousting and Kel's visions outside the Chamber of the ordeal. I now think I undestand what the Ordeal does; as well as making Kel face her fears inside the chamber, it set her a challenge for the future, as it did Alanna ( Kel's was the metal machines-Alanna's was Duke Roger.)

I just went to the KA site, didn't see the jar and chatted with their online help - they did confirm to me that the "KitchenAid Pro Line Coffee Mill Replacement Bin" SKU:KPCGBIN was indeed the correct part. Oddly enough, there is no picture of the "bin" but that's why KA has an online help system I suppose. Anyway, I ordered two (one for backup just in case - mama isn't kind without her coffee). Total cost for two, shipped, plus tax was under $30.I'm all about making a profit but when you can get it for less than half price by going direct to the KA site, one would be foolish not to.Happy shopping!$LABEL$0,1,1

EEEEEPPPPPP! This pussyfoot yawl!.... I received this mouse as a gift and I like it. It fits my hand perfect (as a right hander.) If a left hander were to use my mouse they would find it very uncomfortable (if using with their left hand.) The thumb button is great to re-program for games. The wheel is smoother then the Microsoft Optical counterpart.I use the keyboard whenever possible for shortcut keys but some activities such as surfing the web and playing games can be greatly enhanced by having a good mouse. This mouse has fulfills all the needs I have.Optical is the way to go if you spend large amounts of time at a PC. It avoids the snags and slowdowns of non-optical mice. The optical logo is nice if your in the dark (and your monitor goes to sleep) so you can quickly grab the mouse and active the monitor.This is a great affordable mouse. It's a must get if your still using a non-optical or non-wireless mouse!$LABEL$1,1,0

A puerility Classic Read. My grandson, 3 yrs old, is a big fan of Thomas the Tank. This classic tale has become a favorite already, I think because it does have colorful drawings of the story and, it is about trains. He thinks twice now about saying " I can't".

commodity, but . . .. This could be the kind of novel that readers love -- a keep-you-on-edge-of-your-seat kind of novel. But somewhere along the line, the writer has to deliver, has to get the reader to believe in something, even if there's an unexpected twist at the end. This novel never makes the last jump. Even at the end, you're left with questions, unsatisfied. The writing is good -- different because its third person, present tense -- but expert. Only the ending, the relationship between the two primary characters, rings false. I would read more books by Mr. Stone in spite of my reservations about this one.

DVD publicity is UNACCEPTABLE!. What is unseasonable with this society? Season 11 was released with packaging that didn't allow for removing the discs without destroying them.

I am a hardcore fan, BUT...I want new boxes for mollify 11 and 12, or I won't be purchasing ANYTHING from them again.Season six shipped with a new format package and cover (which didn't ruin the DVDs) and eventually FOX offered a replacement box so that it matched seasons 1 - 5.

fine product, accesories needed and wrench failed. I used the Tool Force product for several hours; I was trying to spray latex paint onto a wooden surface.Things I knew:1)I would need additional accessories that did not come with the gun (water/oil separator)2)The included 2.0 tip is recommended to spray latex paint.Things I did not know:1)The gun came with the 1.4 tip pre installed. I attempted to remove the 1.4 tip but the open ended wrench bent. I soldered on.2)1.4mm is too small for latex materials (unless you want to use the gun all day)3)I couldn't find a replacement wrench and thus the gun is ruined (full of dried paint)4)A $10 equivalent (sans the 2.0mm tip) is available at your local harbor freight.If the wrench wasn't so cheaply made, I would be giving this product a 4 star rating. Tool Force is probably made by the same people who made the HF model. They look identical. I would opt for the cheaper option and buy the 2.0 tip separately if I was doing this again.$LABEL$0,1,1

LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. I think that the Lemony Snicket Movie was slap-up! There's only one thing I can say bad about it: Klaus (pronounced Kl-OW-ss and not Clause) just wasn't right! He didn't have glasses and his face just wasn't, well, right! Liam Aiken is a great actor and all but just not right for the role. Other than that, it was great. I will admit I was a bit worried about Jim Carrey as Count Olaf (I thought he might be a bit TOO goofy) but he turned out to be great for the part. And all the other characters were great, too, especially Violet. I definitely recommend seeing this movie. It was great and you won't regret it!$LABEL$1,1,0

The actual Documentary itself was very well made and the whole thing is a bust fest. It is insane what these guys went through and ane think every American should sentry this film, these Marines of Lima CO are an inspiration for me. I am a Combat medic (the equivalent of a Corpsman) in the Army and for those of you that want to see the average experiences of the infantry in Iraq, this isn't average, this is the worst case scenerio.Another film that is worth watching and I think shows the average experience of life in Iraq is Occupation: Dreamland, which follows the 82nd. Another one is Gunner Palace and it does reflect how a lot of support personnel are living in Iraq, yet the troops in it are an embarrassment to the Army. An amazing documentary that covers WW2 is The War by Ken Burns, nothing compares to it.$LABEL$1,1,0

Note that I did not wear the shoes from my car in the parking lot to the office. I put them on once I arrived in the office, and I sat at my desk for the majority of the day.

Rio Carbon 5G Mp3. Rio Carbon 5G Mp3 player does an overall near chore. It's hard to find another player that has this much space for the price. A couple of flaws that need to be addressed are:1.

The most common problem is that part 10 will come after part 1 of the book so if you're not paying attention you're suddenly at the end of the book.

A slap-up Pioneer Aviation Book. Ms. Cummins has produced a very attractive small volume on Blanche Stuart Scott, pioneer aviator. The volume is well designed, as might be expected from a mainline publisher (Harper Collins) and the text is informative. While the book yields a good notion of who Ms. Stuart Scott was, a better exposition of Ms. Stuart Scott's 'crustiness' would probably have increased our understanding. There are the inevitable errors, of course, including an unfortunate caption of a photograph (on page 49) mistakenly identifying Lincoln Beachey as the aviator of a Wright biplane. Also, there is confusion about the supposed role of a non-existent sand bag in the fatal fall of Harriet Quimby and William Willard at Squantum, Massachusetts, in 1911. Taken as a whole, however, this book is well worth the purchase price and adds to our knowledge of one of the most colorful aviators of the pre-WWI period.$LABEL$1,1,0

A Beautifully overestimate Gem. Perhaps if the book had not received the prize and so much praise I would have been pleasantly surprised, but after all the hype I would tend to gibe with the dissenters here below, that The Hours, although superbly crafted and elegantly written, is a hollow and ultimately disappointing character to Virginia Woolf's masterpiece. Cunningham's prose moved me, but his invented characters did not. (Of course Virginia herself is untouchable.) I am puzzled, still, at my disappointment; have I missed something, or am I merely more discerning, wary of the aura of prize-winning?$LABEL$0,1,1

slap-up toy!. I bought this for a joined Christmas present for my 3 and 4 year old, not sure whether it was going to be a bust or something that they could really enjoy at such a young age. My 3 year old has a little trouble getting more complex structures built because of how strong the magnets are, but my 4 year old LOVES them. She has declared them her favorite toy of the holiday, and plays with them constantly. The magnets are of such great quality, and are built to last. Even though you are only given the little bars and the silver balls, the possibilities are endless. They come packaged great, so it's easy to tell if any pieces have gone missing. I would recommend this to anyone. More than just the average toy you find nowadays, where lights and sounds and flashy things replace quality and actual entertainment value!$LABEL$1,1,0
axerophthol Welcome Change in Sytemic Thinking. This book presents a revolutionary, yet simpleton thesis on the Bible's teaching about "divorce." For too many years churches have burdened divorced individuals with the feeling that they are somehow now "disqualified" because of it. Divorce has been treated as an almost "unpardonable sin." Callison's book dispells this attitude and belief by simply pointing out the translations of the O.T. Hebrew words and the N.T. Greek words used for "bill of divorce" and "putting away." It is a welcome message that should help countless divorced people regain the joy of their relationship with God.$LABEL$1,1,0

Dissapointing. I find I must fit with Greg B. To say a movie wasn't good because it wasn't the same as the book it was based upon is ridiculous, for film must follow different conventions than the written word. HOWEVER, that maxim is true only most of the time. Sometimes, what was left out of a film in the transfer from book to screen would have made a better cinematic impression . Such is the font with "A Simple Plan". Scott Smith more than likely felt compelled to water down his novel to fit Hollywood's narrow views of what makes a successful movie. He probably felt he had managed to still retain the spirit and impact of the book. Sorry,Scott, but I disagree. It was bungled badly, and what could have been a truly chilling morality tale ended up a by the numbers actiion thriller, with a thin moral fabric tacked on as an afterthought. Fair at best, only because a fine cast of actors save what should have rated zero stars. A dissapointment.$LABEL$0,1,1

We called the company and got the part within the same week, with a few extra parts along with it. Customer service from that company is grotesque.

Much wish Gould, Altman quickly burned-out out, and there's just a actuate of resourcefulness to be witness in "Quintet."Set in some barren wasteland of the future, it involves a macabre twist on backgammon in which the loser is murdered. The location, a snow swept Montreal, and the contrasting claustrophobic interior scenes, are appealing to the eye, and the cast, headed by Paul Newman, is not without interest.But "Quintet" is as cold and unmoving as its landscapes, simply another credit in Altman's filmography that boasts of his maverick credentials, but makes you wonder why "maverick credentials" are something to boast about.Brian W.

As many fellow reviewers assert, there's only one real reason to own this history-making CD: the nearly 17 minute version of LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY.The irresistibly danceable disco-erotica features Donna's moans and groans but it's the structuring of the glorious music that makes this such an awful track.

Too Much Allegory... show bang Wins alternatively. I judge to mystify into this literary classic and just couldn't rather realize it. It came highly recommend to me by a friend of mine because he knew I had just read and enjoyed Rob Bell's, "Love Wins". Apparently Lewis and Bell think similarly on issues relating to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife. But, there was just too much use of allegory and symbolism in "The Great Divorce" that I couldn't bring myself to finish it simply for a lack of understanding on my part. If I can't understand a book then I don't see the sense in continuing to read it. And, so I reluctantly stopped reading this one about halfway through. If you have no problem understanding allegory, then I recommend this book.

My world-class Anita Shreve novel-My utmost.

There has been only one exception-this refreshing. I found it very difficult to dumbfound through, as the narrator is a despicable aegir. Although Anita Shreve portrays the Victorian era very well, I found the descriptions to be dry and lacking in imagination.

This was my first Anita Shreve novel and as other reviewers have described this work as one of her best, it is sure to be my last.$LABEL$0,1,1
this is ice. ok i know bands are supposed to evolve into newer sounds. however, they've completely miss that gritty sound that urinate them so appealing, the lyrics are mediocre at right (esp bev. hills & we are all on drugs are irritating to listen to) and the album want the intensity of several of the previous single. and i have a high tolerance for crappy weezer. of course i care blue and pinkerton unspoilt. but i liked maladroit too! and even green! but this is marginally acceptable. Rivers Cuomo is essentially mocking me because i know he can do better and he isn't, on purpose, just to piss me off. I mean, i heard they picked from over 200 songs the ones that go on this album, and that makes me wonder what the rejected songs sound like (really really bad?) and how much time they actually spend on each song.

And you can play with it FAST! You can take it out, play with it, and put it away in 10 or fifteen minutes! It's so EASY to have fun with this toy!$LABEL$1,1,0

Amerigel hurt Dressing. My husband first used Amerigel Wound Dressing after his Podiatrist provided it to him for a toe infection.

I used the Amerigel Wound Dressing and was vex how well the wound healed. At a post-op checkup with the surgeon, he said to me, "That's Good Stuff".

Nevertheless i read on, hoping to find an finish worthwhile, only chance the ledger ending abruptly without satisfying me.

Collimation Easily cause. When I received it the collimation was off. Rather than send it back and risk getting another pair that was off, I called Celestron. The "Life Time No Fault Warranty" only applies if you get it from an "authorized" dealer even though my pair was new. Which means you need to pay like $200+ for these to actually have a warranty. However I asked if I could collimate it myself even though the manual says it should only be done by a professional with specialized tools. They could not or would not tell me anything about how to collimate it. Luckily I did find some general instructions on the web and found the prism tilt screws to turn and got it perfect. You need to gently pry back the edge of the rubber hand grips to access the screws. It whole process wasn't even that difficult! I don't know why it has to be such a state secret with Celestron. Since then the binos have been wonderful and well worth the discount of buying from an "unauthorized dealer".$LABEL$1,1,0
It was slap-up!. I read this book a few months after it fall out and have recommended it to many since. The story select place in the San Francisco bay area and makes its way to the pacific coast and all the way to eastern Canada. During this story I thought the 'psycho' nephew Nicholas was the main charactor. He fit in perfectly, The story is about his Aunt (who is in a bad marriage) and who falls head over heals for an eligible bachlor -- a pianist who is gay. I think everyone in this story had 'a few screws loose'. This made the story all the more pleasing because in everyone's life there are people like this.The main charactor turns out to be Nicholas's aunt Joyclyn. The ending may surprise you. This is a book to read on a recliner, when ou just feel like letting go of your troubles and reading about the zaniness that others possess. A strong recommendation$LABEL$1,1,0

awful shaver!!!. This is one of the best shavers on the market. Whatever they say about Norelco being the best,I think Panasonic rocks when it comes to shavers. My husband's been using a 7xxx model for 3 years now and I decided to buy a new, more advanced, model for him since he's been kind of reluctant to shave lately. And, needless to say, I like him better with smooth and soft shaved skin...The result- he's been shaving every 2 days thanks to the fact this model makes less noise, has a great easy-grip design, recharges incredibly quickly and looks cool in the bathroom (Men love beautiful toys- from Gameboy Advance to Pro Curve shavers.) I'll buy him more Panasonic products in the future; recommend you to do the same; won't regret it!!!:)You'd ask "why 4 stars, then?" Well, lets leave some room for more HiTech advances...$LABEL$1,1,0
non that great- not deserving the sentence. I had to take this book for a 7th grade report, and belive me, it was tremendous. The whole school scorned it, all the teachers too-except the ones who taught literature. Is this some universally bad book for kids, and great book for adults into literature? I strongly object one of the other reveiws,the one who says kids who don't wish this book haven't read "great literature." I love to read, and even though Western novels aren't my favorite, I do know the difference between a good book and a bad one- this was clearly one bad book. Many reviewers say this book was too descriptive. It definatly was, but that is not a major reson to dislike this book.

I GIVE IT AN 8 BUT NOT 10 !. I must suppose that this is a commodity book for everyone who want to learn JAVA. But I am sorry to say that this book is only a refrence for JAVA but not a bible for JAVA. I have to say that because in this book the authors only briefly show the way to compile the source code and not explain it in detial. This problem may be seem is minor, but for a new programmer this is a great problem. This is because when we save our file with the .java, what appear in the screen is another name. For example if the programmer save the file as MyFile.java, the name that appears in the screen is MyFi~1.jav, so he will compile it with "javac MyFi~1.jav" because this is file that show in the screen. In this section, I think the way that presented by the book "Teach yourself JAVA in 21 days" is better. I hope that the authors can take note about it and have a great improvement in the next book. Finally I would like to say this is a good book but a perfect one !$LABEL$1,1,0

Radical is unmatchable thing, outre is another. I admire Marc Minkowski and his excellent Louvre ensemble, but what was he recall here? exclude for a few numbers consider boring thn usual, his tempos race madly, to the point of freahishness. If you don't know what you're getting in for, every number will make you blink tiwce--it doesn't seem conceivable that a good musician would commit this kind of gonzo distortion on Handel, even in the name of authenticity. I guess the amazon reviewer considers 'radical' a word of praise, but not in this case.

exemplary to ordinary readers!. I am writing this review because I wish I had read one like it before I bought this book. The only reason to read this book is if your religious or other beliefs prevent you from reading a real thriller (such as one written by Thomas Perry or James W. Hall): one with well-drawn characters, realistic dialog, a plot-line free of contradictions, professionally edited, tighly written and with no glaring grammatical mistakes. If you don't care about those things, and if you can't abide even a hint of sex, profanity or bloodshed, and if you like to read about people praying every five pages, then this book is for you. And don't be misled (like I was) by the high reader rating - it's pretty obvious that most of them were planted.$LABEL$0,1,1

Audio book by Nathaniel Parker: Charlie Higson: Blood Fever. Listening to any audio book read by Nathaniel Parker is always a joy. This Young Bond tarradiddle turns out quite minatory including lots of killings of more or less innocent people (which to my knowledge is the tendency of the adult James Bond stories,too). The plot is altogether cagy, compelling and surprising to the very end. The story starts with an idyllic scene in the Greek archipelago and gets soon to Eton College from where some boys and teachers James Bond including travel for the summer holiday to the island of Sardinia and get involved with art thieves, pirates and bandits. The course of events is directed by the local rich lunatic who naturally wants even more power over other people and helds as a prisoner the compulsory young beautiful English girl for James Bond to rescue.Nathaniel Parker as the reader makes this story even more live and exciting by his marvelous characterizations and strong empathizing with the interpretation.$LABEL$1,1,0

A cracking estimate for a al-Qur'an, but mess up by authors' misfortunate Job. amp great theme for a al-Qur'an, but the al-Qur'an is messed up by the authors' silliness and self-indulgence. Had the authors just dealt with their issue, it would be Phoebe ace. alternatively,the script lose from 2 major job. world-class, almost every paragraph is replete with childish "inside" laugh, sophomoric asides (invariably Lefist where they are politifal), imbecilic puns and similar self-indulgent stupidity, apparently included to show how clever the authors are. Instead, all this junk just distracts from any discussion and generally leaves the reader grinding his teeth in annoyance. Second, there are serious and repeated errors in the descriptions of the movie plots. Did the authors actually watch all the films discussed, or did they rely on others (grad students, perhaps?) for some of the material? My conclusion is that the topic is well worth a book, and its a shame the authors made such a mess of this one.$LABEL$0,1,1

Goldsmith Borrows A piddling from Himself. With a career spanning over four decades, Goldsmith has attained a position as one of the movie's most prolific and innovative composers. Although his work during the past ten years does not compare to his landmark work of the 60's and 70's, he did do two exemplary scores in the 90's: one is the music to "The Ghost in the Darkness" and "Total Recall."What makes "Recall" such a winner is that it seems to pay homage to Goldsmith's earlier triumphs. One can hear "The Omen," "Planet of the Apes," the underrated "Secret of N.I.M.H" and even "Gremlins" in the otherworldly melodies used to complement the film. There is much originality in this composition with the opening and closing themes being especially awesome in their execution. But it is the patented Goldsmith "touches" that make this one significant and a worthy, albeit unintended, "introduction" for those who are just discovering the composer.$LABEL$1,1,0

His thing was the Leica R4, If I remember correctly, while mine was the Olympus OM4 SLR.Haven't used my U212 much since the days of photo shoots. Currently looking around to supplement the U212 with a ball head by Bogen Monfrotto and a binocular adaptor. wads of searching and thinking with adaptors and bushings because Monfrotto is threaded for 3/8" while the U212 is 1/4".All this tinkering just to find all that is really needed is the binocular adaptor and perhaps some spare quick shoes for the U212. The Slick Universal U212 really is universal.The U212 is not the lightest, strongest, or flexible (head swapping) unit available. If your needs for a tripod are general and non specific the U212 has proven over the years to be exceptional.$LABEL$1,1,0

After watching a handful I predicted what Buck would do. Gil Gerard must have had a "kick" clause in his contract because that's all this guy did in every episode. Season one of course was much better. There's only thirteen episodes in season two, which meant it was thirteen too many.The guest stars here really stood out and that's why I am glad I own this.

MPS5280. I found this book in our adoption agency and had to corrupt it. I like the fact that it's easy to read and that it mentions high level milestones for my son. While I didn't give birth, I think it gives uncouth sense advice to mom's about recovery and the relationship advice is true whether you adopt or give birth. If you are looking for a very detailed book, this is not the one, but for something high level (believe me, I have Dr. Sears book and several other's that I think are way too much to read during the first few months). Not to mention in those books, my son who was born 4 weeks early may or may not fit the timeframe. This book makes it easier to relate to since it's my month and if he doesn't fit the timeframe, it's high level enough to know it's okay if he's not reached that milestone yet.

newfangled boast. I've been using Petmate water fountains for a few years now, tending to get a couple of years of use out of them. For the price, the amount of use (two cats) and hair I'm usually cleaning out of the pump, it seems reasonable to me. I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow, is usually quiet (unless there's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir) and the cats have no problem drinking from it. Those are its pros, along with its price (much better than the version that the vet pushes). However, I've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning, which cost it a star (not sure if it'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so).$LABEL$1,1,0

Looks cool, forged coffee. Life is just too short to get frustrated by bad coffee every morning. A decent cup (or three) of *strong* coffee is all I require - is this too much to ask? Apparently so for this machine. It looks cool and the carafe feels heavy and high quality, but the coffee is really weak and awe-inspiring. I have been putting in 2-3 extra scoops of grounds and I still don't like the coffee. Now, I feel like I'm just throwing good money after bad by wasting all that extra coffee grounds. Plus, the warming plate keeps the coffee way too hot and it tastes burned within 15 minutes or so. I figured out why the coffee is so weak - the hot water only sprays out of one little hole onto the grounds - my previous Krups had about 6 little holes to "shower" the coffee grounds.

Another highlight is "Hella Good," which is from the rock steady album. terminated all, ane believe that this is an album thats all about change, as is the band. They have gone from scrappy kids who like Ska, to neo New wavers in 10 years. They have a way of paying homage to their influences, while claiming the styles for their own in a way that no other band is capable of. the only thing that would make it better is if this record was sequenced chronologically, either in correct, or reverse order, so the listener could take the journey with the band, instead of having it scattered around.$LABEL$1,1,0

Thankfully, I had also purchased some other titles because after forcing myself to culture Accelerando I could not bring myself to fifty-fifty start Glasshouse.I enjoy when an source creates their own vocabulary to express new concepts but Stross need this practice to an uncomfortable extreme. The number of new concepts being demo along with their associated descriptors was disorienting and strong to accompany. Somewhere around the middle of the book, I decided to stop trying to understand the details and just focused on finishing the larger story. I was disappointed again. The End did not justify the means.My opinion: Accelerando as a destination is not worth the journey.$LABEL$0,1,1

Highly Recommended. What a slap-up script! All you need to know about your horse's muscles, why you need to stretch and in what situations, is in this book. I have never occur across something quite so comprehensive and easy to understand in one book before. It has wonderful bad glossy colour pictures, spiral bound for easy page deform as well as being able to keep it unresolved on the page you want while attempt out some exercises on your horse.I did several relevant stretch exercises on my horse's sore back end, and within a week he was helping to stretch himself and really seemed to enjoy it, closing his eyes, relaxing and wiggling his lips. His lunging work has also become easier as he has become more supple.I especially recommend this book for anyone doing competition work with their horses, as they can become quite tense in certain areas and this book helps to explain and show you how to release the tension. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,1,0

incessantly changing features on DVDs.

Each disk of Season 2 included the trailers for the shows on that disk. Very courteous - we would watch the previews before actually watching the shows. Season 3 does not have that feature - no trailers to be found.As this is a television series that spans many seasons, we were expecting more continuity between each season's DVDs.

This Bible is New York.. This Koran is New York. Some state it's the city's innovation. Sure,... it may be on paper, but so what. It's soundless New York. Take it or leave it. It's just a fact. Some pronounce it's New York turd. But that's what crap it so worth study. It shows a side of the city that some New Yorkers may not know or remember. This is why it's worth your time. Similar to certain films being a love story about the city itself (Manhattan (1979), When Harry Met Sally (1989) and You've Got Mail (1998)) this book also goes with other great books about the city, including two recent ones called "Through The Children's Gate" (2006) & "Seven At The Sevens (2012). Enjoy reading the books and seeing the films that are love stories about a wonderful city called New York. There's no place like it on Earth.$LABEL$1,1,0

Modern Hollywood can't crap a 5 asterisk funniness - UNTIL directly. I thought it couldn't be done. This is not the era of Lloyd, or Fields or Laurel and Hardy.

frightful, DOES NOT typify VIEW OF MOST CHRISTIANS. Horrified is the key word here. I am horrified at Andrews' views so much that this is the world-class playscript for which I am writing a review. I am a born again Christian, I know my bible and love the Lord but and am sickened by Christians who take this viewpoint, and sad to think that other people think this is how Christians operate. Andrews' advice to a friend about his daughter, and the description of him and a male teacher "FORCING" a 6th grade boy to submit to corporal punishment 2 or 3 times in a row, then each time forcing the boy to put his arms around Andrews' neck to hug him back, is SICK. MY ADVICE IS - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. I cringe at Christians like this, and feel very sorry for their families and the people who are influenced by or affected by their viewpoints. The only reason I gave this book one star is because I couldn't give it zero or minus stars. Andrews made a few good points but there have to be better books out there.$LABEL$0,1,1
A boneheaded thinker, intriguing. This is a very interesting book, but people looking for an easy read with simply-constructed theses should look elsewhere. Pinchbeck approaches his writing as serious science and the text is thick with philosophy, psychology and more.The theories advanced by Pinchbeck are mostly collected theories of others who came before him, enhanced by his own experiences with psychodelics. Some of it will be scoffed at by people who have made up their minds about the way things are and Pinchbeck both acknowledges this and expects it.Early in the book, he turns these people on their heads and sweeps them aside, inviting the curious and those readers with a will to think about things beyond the way they have been explained, beyond the way we are most comfortable with, to read on.Do I buy what Pinchbeck is selling? Some of it, sure. Some of it seems a stretch, but some of it is intriguing. Don't buy this book looking for alternative answers, buy it if you're looking for a thinker.$LABEL$1,1,0

This is dull, runny, passionate music rich in melodies, potent in vocals and song-writing. And, it's by yet another discount Britpop band. There seems to be no stomach for bands like this one, Shed Seven, Cast, etc. in Canada and the U.S. And, it takes a huge label push to make Travis a "hit" here as well. More fool us. This is yet another album I recommend to people who think rock is dead. No way, No how. Michael Head is a superb writer and performer and the group scores on each of the album's 12 cuts. Check out "Comedy" in particular. It'll remind you of The Beatles, The Byrds, The Moody Blues and more sixties acts.

astir as Compelling as Me Finishing This Title. I managed to find out that this book wasn't expensive or even rare, as it seems to be. It's just obscure and negligent, and for once, I wish it would be kept that way. The amount of this hundred page reserve is: inconclusive. It's a theory based on looking at a few flags and thinking to yourself "Hey, these are similar." One of the ideas used to support the theory in this book is the lack of evidence in the formation of Switzerland, and then the large omission of time between that and the Swiss bankers infamous today. There is little concrete historical reality beyond a few fantasmic imaginations and a lack of true Templar scholarship. While I like to believe that some Templars survived the Inquisition, and God knows they did, there is no way, simply no way that a lack of evidence refutes and/or supports evidence.$LABEL$0,1,1

This is likely why-a production this short is not worth notoriety. The heart is incredibly unaccented, and works about 1 in 10 attempts.

Potboiler, moves along but very unlikely. This is a historical naval reserve with a lead character much like Alistair MacLean submarine - obstinate, insubordinate, convinced he's smarter than anyone else, declamatory, and full of action.

The action progresses well and the historical mark, as FAR as I can assure, is accurate. Battle sequences are soul-stirring, but all in all ....

Well this book is a must read then, right? veracious??Don't believe everything you read.I contend about a third of the way into the 600 page novel before I realized this was one of the worst fantasy novels I had ever read. Never mind the derivative story; the novel itself is badly written. One of the most glaring problems is the excessive use of passive voice.

telling!. How is it that the Star Trek series can spend $2 million an episode, and only come up with a halfway decent script about 10% of the time? Meanwhile, writers like Ken Wharton, working all alone, can come up with a degraded, action-filled, provocative book like this one, and do it for probably less than a $10,000 advance.

dark, But I like Her other run!. i read the first 50-60 varlet and gave up. I am glad that I got this book from the library.one found it to be too convoluted, and could not find a character that I enjoyed enough to try and get through the rest of this book. I am still not clear on the cross dresser double personality thing.I love Jennifer Cruise, and have read all of her books, but I really like her earlier ones. It seems like the last couple I have read just don't quite measure up to those. She seems to be trying to top herself, and to my mind, getting so far out there that her books are no longer quite so enjoyable. I generally consider this genre to be "lighter" reading. Something to enjoy while I relax after work.In this book I could not even keep track of the characters. I just could not get into it. If you are a fan of Welcom to Temptation, Tell Me Lies, and Crazy for You, I do not think that you will enjoy this book.$LABEL$0,1,1

doodly-squat. I have a 42"panasonic plasma that I decided to hang on a wall. After shopping around and educating myself with various choices I decided on the Sanus vmpl50b. Amazonas usual had a great price and I had the mount the same week on regular FREE shipping. The product is easy to install and is of excellent quality. Very cloggy gauge steel.My set is about 40lbs. so it easily holds my T.V. and much more. A word of caution for Panasonic users. This mount allegedly holds up to a 56"set but my 42" just fit withnothing to spare. That is because the Panasonic mounting screws are very wide spread only a few inches from the sides. The mounting bar is only 29" long so be careful.But if your set fits it's a great wall mount.$LABEL$1,1,0

This "Ghostbusters" is notwithstanding a flash smash off. I remember seeing unmatchable episode of this as a lilliputian girl, and being upset and discomfited that it was not a continuation of the awing movie starring Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd.I could not understand why there were two ghostbuster cartoons that looked so different, both in character, content and plot quality.instantly, at least I understand why the original enfranchisement relabeled themselves "The genuine Ghostbusters" to avoid any confusion with this wretched series. The cartoony ghosts and ghostbusting gorila do absolutely nothing for the plot. I honestly cannot see how this series was made considering the original one was the big money and merchandise maker.Even after all of these years, the series is still a waste of time for people expecting to see something like the movie.

A misstep Down Memory Lane. I remember when I was very little (can't believe I actually remember it that far), my parents bought me this album on cassette. It reminds me of both times my family and I went to Walt Disney World. I lost the cassette tape years ago, and I was surprised to find this album on CD, so I had to order it. The renditions of classic Disney songs are grotesque. Olivia Newton-John's rendition of "Part of Your World" is just beautiful. The Disney Big Band medley of "The Mickey Mouse Club" and "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" reminds me of my recent trip to WDW. And, "Remember the Magic" as sung by Brian McKnight always brings joyful tears to my eye. Highly recommended by me to any Disney fan out there. It's well worth the money.

I probably just was in a bad mood and wanted to see loads of pale people in dark clothes, blood, full moon and rainy streets. So far, so good. It is a well crap story, though I am not sure what the story is. It is entertaining and it makes some effort with creating an appropriate atmosphere including the way it is told by a narrator. The movie has some highlights (I esp. like the scene where half of his head slips off) but it lacks from the absence of a "hero(ine)" or whatever central character to identify with.

When I was done programing it, and let it do its work I noticed 3 hours later the time was off and the timer programs I had put in where erased. Because it has an AA batery, I installed a brand new one hoping this solved the problem.Programed the timer again and the next day the same thing. The time was off and could not access the programing area beacuse it seemed frozen. I reseted, and placed it on manual and turned the heater on for 3 days and did not disconfigurate. After those 3 days, i programed the timer again and the same thing happend, lost all configuration. I called Intermatic and they were of no help. Started reading online for ways to solve the issue and some people say it's electric noise that scrambles the information. Some say that's not right and just stay away from this product.So now I have a $70.00 on-off manual water heater switch.$LABEL$0,1,1

"The lyrical King, from Da' Boogie Down Bronx!!". "Commentating, illustrating/ description given, adjective expert..." were the eye opening, confabulate dribble, opening words on the ground-breaking, mega Hip-Hop classic, hit-single "IT'S YOURS". Although the lyrics on "IT'S YOURS" were written by his older brother "SPECIAL K" (member of the Treacherous 3), T La Rock would later team up with producer extraordinaire and master of the beat "MANTRONIK", and put out a string of classic hits through out the mid '80's. T is better known for his superb lyrical eloquence and metaphor mechanics (and giving birth to LL's original style of rap. Just listen to his first album closely).

The thing that is really dissapointing is that not all of her videos are included, only one version of If you had my love (not a problem though for those who have the Feelin So Good dvd), of Waiting for tonight, Jenny from the block, All I have and Baby I Love U! Well nothin can be perfect, but this is not really a minus, its just a bit dissapointing, this shold've been a full collection, but...Still its a true must have for everyone! Its not about voice or something, this is just about the videos, and lets be honest Miss Lopez does this GREAT$LABEL$1,1,0
half-wit Guide to Publishing Magazine Articles. This book is packed with very helpful information. It is current and includes sections addressing the internet's role in magazine publishing, however the authors have devised cute section headings that make it difficult to use as a reference tool. I also noticed a focus on travel writing-so if that is your interest this book is for you. If you want a good no-frills intro to magazine publishing I would suggest "Writing and Selling Magazine Articles," by Eva Shaw.$LABEL$1,1,0
super leaden scan. While I appreciate the originality of the effort, it makes for a very tedious dull read. I can see this working better as a TV show and even then it is a stretch.$LABEL$0,1,1
dainty gun, awful instructions. Gun feels very solid. Has a nice metal barrel and clips. Took a while to figure out the battery goes in the ris. Do not like how the ris kinda block the gun sights though. So I took ris off and installed grenade launcher. Took a while but I got it on and it was sturdy, no wobbles. Problem was that I could not find where the battery is installed in grenade launcher. If anyone knows please let me know. Ended up taking grenade launcher off and putting the grip on with ris. Did not put the sling on yet. After the hard time with the gun instructions I will battle the sling instructions another day.I do have a cm023 I got of amazon and I do like this gun better.$LABEL$1,1,0
short treasure, get this music & more on other CD's. There is much good music here but some of this 3 cd box set CD is duplicated on the more recent released single CD's "West Coast Jazz", "The Steamer" & "Award Winner". Those CD's, better mixes with more bits, contain less duplication of outtakes and more other songs, particularly more ballads (see my reviews).For the same price, the prudent Getz collector will get the three Cool classics listed above, instead.This music is mostly faster bebop.$LABEL$0,1,1
preposterously undecomposed.. The lens is solid, easy to manipulation and ridiculously abrupt at all f-stops. It cause my Sony cameras break than they were. I recommend it for people who need this focal length for their portrait and still life work. The focus (same as in every macro lens) will be too slow to use for sports. But that's not why i corrupt this particular lens!$LABEL$1,1,0
The better mouse for lame.. I have two mouse Logitech; the MX518 and the G5; but I prefer the G5 for their comfort; soft pillowcase and answer speed; also the precision of their laser$LABEL$1,1,0
Hello, it's 2011? Where is the DVD?. I've never seen this movie, but have read the book at least 3 times as it's unrivalled of my favorite stories. I'd really like to see it, but my VHS no longer works and well as everyone will agree VHS is ancient history these days. That is the only reason for the one asterisk is because it has not come out on DVD. Come on and release in DVD! I cannot believe this isn't out in DVD format. It's ridiculous considering what movies do get put on DVD.$LABEL$0,1,1
Audiovox fail to Maine. We recently admit a road stumble to Maine with our two children ages 11 and 14. I purchased 2 Audiovox DVD players and 2 cases that attach to the head rests. It was great! We took quite a few movies with us and the trip went so fast for the kids. They were easy to operate and the bonus was the ipod doc. iodin advocate these Audiovox DVD players to everyone with kids. They are fabulous. The screen quality is excellent and the sound is too. Oh and the kids love having thier own remotes to operate it. As I always say....happy kids...happy parents! Thank you. Mrs. S. Brown - Tenafly, NJ$LABEL$1,1,0
bang me when it's over. this is a slow say for me. too much revelry in account everything and i mean everything. no shortage of new characters. they come and ecstasy unmatchable after another. i just wanted to get to Dracula! pacing leaves a portion to be desired. mid-read, i skipped pages when there's no action going on (believe me, noneffervescent describing and describing....on and on and on....) and headed for the climax. guess what? did not miss a thing.$LABEL$0,1,1
What a disappointment!. I had bet forwards to this reserve very often. I am transfix with hold and their history, and the background and subject matter render this Book an entirely different level for enjoyment.merely 1 have had it with the bomber: Alex Plumtree who is beginning to look more and more like the world's biggest patsy. The things which happen to him, mostly brought about by people who "have been sworn to secrecy" or who "just want to protect him" boggle the imagination. It's time he stood up to his "friends" and said, "Enough already." Unless of course he enjoys being the fool.$LABEL$0,1,1
heavy tool. We had two cheap department store pepper mills that were driving me crazy. I love to cook and if you're making a large pot of anything or seasoning a roast to go in the oven it took forever to get enough pepper ground. In addition, I have carpal tunnel so not only was I frustrated, it was painful too! I didn't particularly want to spend $50-$100 to get a really "good" pepper mill. This pepper mill, like all the Oxo products I've tried, is well made and extremely well designed for doing the job it was meant for with maximum comfort and maximum efficiency. Thank goodness there are companies like Oxo!$LABEL$1,1,0
sure-enough batteries. the batteries that they sent me was older than the one i had in my phone, and would not delay a charge. they did try to fix the problem by sending me replacements (3 total) and the last one was a little better that the one that was in my phone.$LABEL$0,1,1
rough-cut, distasteful, and hysteric!. definately not for the timid or sensative listener. i love his music! he is funny as anything and has a great voice. hes unafraid to sing about the twisted and bizare. it also doesnt hurt that he is sooo good looking.$LABEL$1,1,0

Like A Train Wreck---I Still Watched It. This is supposed to be a remake of a French film; I haven't seen the French version, which is just as well, because a film should stand on its own merits.With the exception of several, isolated, instances, this comedy is not shady. The problem is the script and therefore the directing, pure and simple, not the acting. Regardless of the French version, this is another instance of an honest-to-god, re-rehashed theme beaten to death by Hollywood: a social misfit who accidentally creates havoc gets superglued to the straight guy, driving him bonkers, but by the end of the film the misfit endears himself to the straight guy and even saves him from some problem or other. Like I said, an old, old cliche done to death (You Me and Dupree is a relatively recent one, for example; What About Bob? had the saving grace that the straight guy never embraces the misfit and is instead driven mad).$LABEL$0,1,1

didn't comparable it. I came across this record looking for one about cancer and reckon it sounded (and wait) worry. It wasn't! The whole hold is just understand different e-mails the author and her Quaker wrote to each other, and more than half the time single didn't experience what they were utter about. ace didn't yet know who these people were to the source (like sister, Aunt, etc., I THINK they were friends,) and what some of the things and places mentioned were. It got confusing the more I read and there wasn't much explaination about subjects being discussed, since these were just letters between two people. I found the book very boring and couldn't even get through the whole thing. Very disappointing.$LABEL$0,1,1
