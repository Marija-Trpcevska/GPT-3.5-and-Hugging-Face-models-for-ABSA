great photos, semi-beginner to advanced. This book came out before the huge glut, and I still like thumbing through it. The examples are marvelous. While it walks you very well through some projects, others are sort of "on your own." Good for an intermediate or advanced beader who wants to do more improvising, but might be frustrating for a new beader. I recommend learning the basic stitches elsewhere, but fix this book, if only for the wonderful photos of work by very talented bead artists. It also has a useful section on balancing color and bead size, more useful information if you're ready to start personalizing your projects. It covers different stringing options well, and provides a good start for wire working. They could have left out the section on polymer clay, though.$LABEL$1,1,0

No violins, no Morten doing any vocals at all (and he has a great singing voice, not just his growls). This is reminding me an awful lot of another band that went down this road -- a band called Theatre of Tragedy.If you like the old albums, don't bother buying this one.

That's really all you need, because every song sounds exactly the same.That's all we needed, another failure in gothic metal.$LABEL$0,1,1

Sex between a husband and wife is expressing that love. international of matrimony sex is a blunder that seperates you from God. Sin is DEATH.

not a very undecomposed movie.. I just finished watching Dogville. The concept and story are awesome. The acting and script are decent at best - I think von Trier did everything in one take and didn't care how wooden or emotionless the acting was as long as he had the shot. The use of the narrator is such a lazy thing to do - a director should show the audience what the characters are thinking and feeling, not tell them. I don't have a qualm with narrations if used only a few brief times in a film. Dogville uses narration very frequently and for no real reason other than Lars von Trier didn't feel like showing (or couldn't figure out how to show) the audience what is happening. The editing is dreadful. There are random jump cuts that exist for no reason (unlike, say, Traffic or Memento where the jump cuts make sense or at least look awesome). The film annoyed me more than it entertained me or made me think. I rate the film a 2/5, mostly for the concept and story. Dogville had so much potential.$LABEL$0,1,1

Cultural issues aside, ane find this the most contact young children's Scripture i have encountered for its completely unmoved demonstration of motherly affection. And truly, the illustrations enrich the beauty of the text.

Good photography but footling factual detail. A well presented book with a wide variety of photographs making it a good source of ideas for interior designers. Beyond that there is little to commend it. Most of the pictures are not referenced, even those of grand or unique designs of fireplace. The commentary is lacking in technical and historical detail and the organisation into historical periods is only loosely adhered to. Not a bad coffee table book but not much undecomposed if you neediness information on designing, building or choosing a fireplace.$LABEL$0,1,1

Too forte, doesn't do often. I got this thing when I first bought my 360 because of all the crap I heard about the 360 overheating. My first complaint is that the fan noise is even louder than the xbox dvd drive noise (which is pretty loud). Unless you have whatever you're playing/watching turned up pretty loud, this thing will noticably drown some of it out. I ended up read it off because of this.As for the cooling aspect, I have played many hours both with and without this fan and have noticed no difference whatsoever. I have noticed that the air coming out of the 360 feels cooler, but the system never crashed regardless of whether I had this thing on or not.The only reason I am giving this thing 2 stars is because I would imaging if you WERE having a problem with cooling (like if you lived in a hot climate or had a lemon), then this would probably keep your xbox cooler.$LABEL$0,1,1

reversion. The Cranberries were once a band that had a mission to purge their souls of pain. Now the band is at the lofty heights of fame and success.

Happiness has a flip side for disturbed artists: it also kills their creativity!Hence, you have "Bury The Hatchet", a watered down album that is lacking in originality, added is a feeble attempt to cover up this lack of originality with the song "Copy Cat", which actually sums up the compilation of songs on this release.$LABEL$0,1,1

adorable but for the static electricity.. I've been using my burr grinder for about a year now. The good news is that it grinds the beans perfectly every time. The bad news is that it's a mess to clean (necessary every couple weeks) and defective of all, the grinding creates so much static electricity that when you remove the reservoir from the machine, there is a small burst of grounds that explodes from it and ends up on the machine and the counter. If you live in an area with high humidity, this might not be such a problem. But, if you live in a dry area (here in California, it's dry from May to October), then static will be a headache.Capresso could probably correct this by making the little bin out of metal instead of plastic so the static would discharge through the machine.Otherwise, it's a wonderful device and I recommend it if you're fussy about your coffee.$LABEL$1,1,0

adenine rattling version of a classic tale. Polacco's book is a time honored theme, this retelling from the Ukraine. When Luba saves the Wren's life her parents insist she return to ask for a favor. The parents never seem to be satisfied and send Luba back time and time again. In the end the parents are returned to the happy couple they were when they started. This Scripture can be successfully compared with any of the many available versions of the Fisherman and His Wife but also contains elements from The Stonecutter -- another tale available in several versions. Sometimes those with seemingly little power/wealth think other situations would make them a different person or happier. And when they do obtain power their humility is lost. Satisfaction seldom comes when one has not earned that power or wealth. Polacco's wonderously beautiful watercolors brings this theme into the full vision of readers. A delightfully new twist on a classic tale.$LABEL$1,1,0

I could play that time waster all day - but something is amiss with this gritty and it manages to make me not lack to fun.It could be the loud thumping synth and techno music that plays in the background on infinte loop, or it could be the fact that they attempted to add a story to Tetris by adding strange "creatures" that speak a more annoying version of Animal Crossing's babelese, it could be that the colors look like they have been washed out and are difficult to tell apart, or it could be that there are barely any modes to play except marathon tetris games.I think the real reason is that they just botched it.

Doesn't exploit for everyone!. My two year old daughter has been sucking the middle two fingers of her left hand since just hours after her birth.

Do you sit and wait in the hope it will return? Do you try to find out what happened and thereby get hold of some more cheese? The book has a message so do not get put off by the fable format.

1/2 Good. indeed maybe I'd give it 2-1/2 stars if it was possible.The good: The visual. Very thoroughgoing. Very arresting.The bad: You HAVE to convince yourself to leave believability at the door. From beginning to end.Yeah, yeah, I know this is comic book stuff. But to sit through two hours of getting beaten over the head with over the top violence gets pretty damned softened for the viewer. In my case it took me only 30 minutes to pull the plug on my DVD. Why? Because Rourke's superhuman character gets pulverized by a speeding car THREE times and walks away virtually unscathed, save for a bloodied face. But then, a few scenes later, get's knocked UNCONSCIOUS by a sledgehammer to the noggin.Huh? Direct impact by a speeding automobile inflicts almost zero bodily harm, but a hand held piece of hardware k.o.'s him?!?Safe to say I won't finish this movie anytime soon. If ever.

An even dozen isn't unspoiled. Ocean's 12 want the fun of its predecessor, Ocean's 11, mostly because there really AREN'T 12 master thieves running amok....most of the cast spends their time sitting in a cell, an extremely piteous decision on the director's break. Where's the humor of Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac and the Mormon Twins? Locked up for half the movie!The story theme is bang-up: Benedict knows who ripped him off, and the insurance payment isn't enough to soothe his wounded ego; he wants it back from the thieves. Another master thief issues a challenge to the team: steal a Faberge egg before I do, and I'll pay your debt for you. The director and screenwriters lose it from there, though, by separating everyone.Still, the movie has its moments, with Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts, and a witty cameo by Bruce Willis. The ending leaves an opening for Ocean's 13, and let's hope they get a bit better script next time around.$LABEL$0,1,1

Drama at Eyam. Having visited Eyam, the Plague Village, Brooks described Anna's town and the spread of disease in the village with right amount of creepiness I felt at the real village. The dim-witted prose has been admonished by some reviewers as poor description and character building, asking for more flowery language. First of all, this book is about the plague and from the perspective of a simple woman--not a noble woman with delicate sensibilities. I apprise the down to earth style of writing, as the character, Anna, appears to be a `down to earth' kind of woman. She is an incredibly strong character, even though she demonstrates some poor judgement with her choice of lover--but haven't we all made poor life decisions?

She is offered freedom (for a price). The once pleasant Red King is causing harm to those who don't obey him.Classic fantasy. Good roast joins with relatively good guy, they cross lands together so as to thwart the evil "baddy" who is not as evil as they thought.

People say it is the world's greatest concept album, but it's not even in the same league as Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon".The fact is that there are some good songs here (A Day in the Life, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band) and some poor songs as well (Within You Without You, When I'm 64, With A Little Help From My Friends, Fixing A Hole). Average them all out and you get a slightly below average album. 2-stars$LABEL$0,1,1
cracking. I just got it today in the mail and tried it out and I must say it's pretty cracking. It's a lilliputian dogfight setting it up though; clamping it to a table and adjusting the stripteaser blade for the peeling depth.

skilful idea, peaked execute. The Wrap worked great for me for the first couple years of use, though the plastic that houses the key and remote is of poor quality and started to fall apart after several months. No big deal, the key still worked. Until... last week, the lock somehow jammed, and I was unable to unlock the Wrap from my steering wheel. I struggled with it for quite some time and even called the 1-800 number on the key. Of course, no one answered. I left a message in a panic, and, of course, no one returned my call. The only way to remove the Wrap was to cut it open and dismantle the lock. The bf brought out his drill and chipped away at the metal and plastic. About an hour later, with a mess of metal and plastic shavings blanketing the car's interior, we removed the Wrap. Overall, a horrible experience. I would never recommend the Wrap to anyone and am searching for a new security device. Suggestions?$LABEL$0,1,1

All over the route on Zen. i had a job with this cinema. The film is based on unretentive stories by Denis Johnson. The movie should have been more shorts with different characters. The flow of it brand you lose characters you grow accustomed to, the drugged out hospital orderly, the AA woman etc, even the Amish women he is involved with in his own way doesn't really evolve the way it should. There are many classic and memorable scenes to enjoy. The ER scene where the two characters get wacked on hospital drugs then have to deal with an emergency is extremely well done.

The best songs on the album, however, are "More Than Everything", "What Livin's All About" (and yes, Lovin's what livin IS all about), and the killer finale, "The Rest Of Forever", a beautiful song about two broken hearts who have to learn how to trust in love again, which is never easy to do.

pin-up. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that this book was so short. I actually made myself stop reading the first night I got it because I did not want it to end so fast.I think that the author could have written much more with the plot... a girl talking to an angel about heaven, an angel asking a girl about life on earth...there is a lot of room for discussion. The ending was very abrupt. Even so, Mr. Gaarder shares some lovely ideas through the words of Cecilia (the main character). This book had a few moments that reminded me of Sophie's World, something totally bizarre that made me literally stop, and think.

The Mulching of America is almost a lot of things- almost a great allegory for blind allegiance (religious, political or otherwise), almost a brilliant satire on corporate America and almost an engrossing page turner... but because it is only almost all of those things it falls far short of being anything great- especially for Harry Crews. Initially the strong premise and requisite eccentric characters draw you in but the plot of the novel never comes into complete fruition and the reader is left unfulfilled and sorely disappointed to the point of frustration.Worth the read?

ane of my teetotum 5 albums. I've been listening to SR-71 for 5 years now, and their first album is noneffervescent (by far) my favorite. It is the perfect mix of pop and crummy - something no other band seems to have gotten right. iodin never get tired of this album, my favorite songs being the entertaining 'Politically Correct' and 'Alive' - a ballad of strength in the face of physical abuse. I can't say enough good things about this CD, the only disappointment is that SR-71's following albums couldn't match its calibur.$LABEL$1,1,0
Great photos!. This book has a lot of great photos, mostly in color. The information is pretty good, but there are some areas that seem to have gaps in the narrative. I also would have liked more in-depth information relating to Hasbro instead of mostly the kind of information that you can get from a list. The book tells you when everything was released, what year, who did what, etc. But it want any human warmth, and there are really no warm stories of the original creators sitting together and working on GI Joe. Sadly, most of the GI Joe books totally ignore the human factor, aside from giving credit to the names of the people who designed, invented, patented, painted, funded, etc. The book is great for photos, and lots of interesting information. Sadly, it is not a warm, fuzzy book about a children's toy!$LABEL$0,1,1

I had seen him perform on the Tonys and thought he was having a ball, if not quiet on pitch with his fellow performers. I had heard he was performing in several Broadway productions and cabarets recently and assumed he had gotten much more comfortable with singing. Unfortunatly, unlike fine wine, he has not improved with age. I would probably go see him in a play but as far as musicals go, I don't see how he could be a selling point. His voice quality has none and the delivery seems tenative and frail. The arrangements seem to be meant for a strong singer that would enhance them. The man should stick to talk shows and acting because he has now proved that anyone can sing---but should they?$LABEL$0,1,1

Fantastic Book but the CD is a complete emaciate of Money. I was so impressed with the fourth Edition of the Valuation text (if you don't own it, buy it now) that I went and ordered the accompanying CD-rom thinking that it would have all the basic financial templates outlined in the book. I specifically wanted a valuation model for Banks.Whilst the model on the CD is fine for valuing non-financial companies, I HAD ALREADY DOWNLOADED IT FROM THE NET FOR FREE. Furthermore the CD didn't include a model for valuing banks - I'm going to have to build a new one from scratch.In other words, I've paid a fortune for something I had already got for free.

book - hard-nosed Wireless Telegraphy E. E. Bucher (1917). In the era this book was written there were NO transistors, tubes were just starting to be used and the only known bands were above the 200 meter band. Most transmissions were in the 600 meter band. "Welding Machines" were vector that is a spark with some interesting method of generating one and tuning circuits were victimised to more or less (by todays standards mostly less) control the output frequency. The crystal set was king, few if any had the latest and greatest regenerative sets (patent 1914).

An diss to all bibliophiles. If you love books and Leroux's novel in paticular do not corrupt this Book. Although the cover art promises great things, alas the illustrations remind one of a Barbie coloring book, only not as sophisticated. The less said of the butchering this line of books commonly does to great novels, the better. A much unspoilt read would be the version illustrated by Hilderbrant as the novel in itself shouldn't be beyond most young readers. For the very young try the Bullseye or Step Up chillers. Both are excellent reads.$LABEL$0,1,1

candid Theism' Roots. I corrupt this desire for some good information. but the first chapter or so is worth reading. His position that God really does not know everything and that if God cannot learn anything would make His life one of stagnation are seriously flawed. I realize that he is quoting others, but they were not worth the space.This Quran will not help an extreme Calvinist reexamine his position, it will only drive him further into his system. The seeds of open theism are seen in the appendices. Quite frankly I was shocked when I read the book.I hold to an unlimited atonement so I am not giving this book a bad review because of its position, but on how the case is made. I would not waste my money on this one again.$LABEL$0,1,1

Beautiful couch throw but. This is a beautiful sofa throw but what I didn't like about it was that it only stops at the top of sofa. It's not long enough. It's great with width from arm to arm but not from feet to back. Picture yourself sitting on sofa. The throw starts at your feet, up to the seat where you sit, and goes up behind you, and then stops at the top. Sitting down alot will make that throw shine down behind you. If it was long enough to go over the back and down almost to the floor in the back of couch, I would have kept the sofa throw. They should add another 60 inches.$LABEL$0,1,1

Stress relief???. I arranged these because I had been reading how ingesting Kava root could produce stress relieving results. The directions say to take one capsule. If you take one capsule, you will probably not notice a damn thing. If you take four to eight of them, you feel something, but I would not call it a "stress excuse feeling." It is more of an rile feeling if anything; it produces a kind of light-headed/headache-y feeling. In my experience with this product, I would say that it does not produce the intended results. But the same can be said for many herbs. Hell, sometimes even a strong cup of coffee won't wake you up in the morning. Point being, results are going to vary from individual to individual, but if you are really interested in this stuff, I would do a Google search for the website for the company that is based in Hawaii that also makes this stuff. They claim to produce Kava with a much higher percentage of Kavalactones.$LABEL$0,1,1

However, I was hoping to use this as a teaching tool to help me and my daughter learn Mandarin together.

Even though there's not much to character customization, besides changing clothes and armor, and a couple of different hairstyles and facial hair styles to choose between, the quests are fun, and the gameplay itself is very fun, gets a little challenging at times, but whats a video game without challenge. Although it's not necessary to play this one to understand the second, there are some refrences and its overall a very good game. I also liked the level up system, not what I'm used to in other RPG's but very new and refreshing. A definite must buy for any gamers who like RPG's.$LABEL$1,1,0

The belt is comfortably lard, the buckle is absolutely secure, and the many grip options pee any position or movement tardily to assist with. I absolutely recommend this product!$LABEL$1,1,0

A tremendous book, funnily unhelpful and funnily direct.. As long time computer user with extensive experience with dBase, I was chagrined and frustrated with my attempts to con dissemble!4 quickly with the help of this book. The author seemed to persistently overstate and elaborate on the obvious, while offering minimum assistance in the more opaque areas. Invariably, what I most wanted to know as a new exploiter was either unavailble or relegated to a chapter nearer the book's index than its beginning. The author, annoyingly, saw fit to repeatedly suggest securing professional help in various areas...and even (and I suspect, self-servingly) cited names of pros who the reader could hire. As a teaching tool, this book is a total bust..unless I'm just not enough of a "dummy" to appreciate it. It's my first and certainly last book of the Dummy series.$LABEL$0,1,1

Enormously cagey and quite moving narrative of the 20th century and what it means. a photo - literally, of three farmers on their way to a dance, taken by August Sander in 1914 - shows us the last moments before the calamitous 20th century hit western civilization full force, with atrocities and dislocation and the good and evil of the modern world. Richard Powers takes this indelible effigy and weaves a brilliant three-part fib: of two men looking for answers to what the picture signified, many years later, and then (as a counterpoint) the "real" story of those farmers from long ago. The less you know the better, but anyone interested in the ways the fiction can uncover the truth behind history, or restore humanity to cold facts of the past, should read this remarkable book. This was Powers' first book, years before he achieved fame and (well deserved) accolades, but he was clearly a fully formed genius from the start.$LABEL$1,1,0

wake up America!. The dilemma of the colonised in search for an indistinguishability which is neither stable and backward-facing, nor imposed by the worldview of the coloniser is the bailiwick of Erdrich's Love Medicine. Her rambling, free-flowing storyline mirrors her secondment of the fluidity of family association, one of the most significant dispute between Euro-American and Chippewa civilisation. withstand the strictures of the novel, the anthology, or any other effected spell elan, Erdrich refuses to abide by the rules of Western traditions of fiction. A slap in the face to any notions of the superiority of such traditions, Erdrich's tales demand attention by being undeniably honest, and evoking empathy for even those characters who represent everything which is in opposition to Western culture, and zeroing in on the painful truths of America's imperialist history without subjecting the reader to a history lesson.

If you're looking for rattling "gloomy carb" this isn't it. The book contains a reasonable number of recipes and lots of 'hints' that if you've done ANY reading about low carbohydrate eating, will be superfluous.The recipes run the gamut of carb counts, though I thought that the bulk of them were much higher carb than is helpful. Following the suggestions in this book and the recipes, it wouldn't be all that hard to hit 80-100++ grams of carb per day... which is simply TOO HIGH for many people who are following low carb lifestyles.Many recipes call for sugar, white flour, semi-sweet chocolate and cornstarch. Come ON... those are NOT "low carb" ingredients.This is more or less a repackaged low fat/lower cal cookbook with "low carb" thrown on the cover to try to generate some market share. My copy is being donated to a charity, it isn't worth the space on the shelf for someone interested in real "low carb" cooking.$LABEL$0,1,1

The way she sees the chakra is completely different from what I'm used to (ie: 7 levels) and she attributes different colors to them. That in itself isn't the biggest deal, but her exercises seem to require extremely specific hand positions and such things which personally (from experience) doesn't require such complex coreography.I have no doubt that what she wrote works for her and will work for someone else our there, but to me, this book isn't what I would see as a "good book to learn from".

Money.. Moran is a well known CIA agent. To screw Moran through her work is diametrically opposite to know her through hervideo interviews on the internet, the most important one already being taken down right now. I might as well writea summary of what that interview said: "you can break your mental and physical limits". This is CIA performancepsychology, and according to rumour, Lindsay Moran is a master of it.Now back to the book review. Lindsay Moran has ill-used every trick of the nonfiction writer: composite characters,fictional characters, outright fabrication, excetera, to create a suspenseful work. The most important point shemakes is that the CIA is no place for women, and that is why she left.This is not the case. Lindsay Moran never left the CIA. No one with this many years of seniority has trouble goingon extended paid leave with benefits (to write a book).In conclusion, the best part of the book is Lindsay potraying herself as a dirty girl when in fact she is a dourGerman Protestant.$LABEL$1,1,0

As safe as the middle volume gets.. The first game introduced us to the cast of the G.U. series and gave us fans of the original games a lot of enjoyable and awesome tweaks to the mundane battle system that was of the first 4 games of the series. I thoroughly enjoyed how this game plays and with the second volume, it adds several new battle mechanics, plus a few mini games for those continuing the series. This lame continues the awesome story line that G.U. vol. 1 Rebirth left off on, and basically brings the player closer to solving the mysteries that the game set out for the gamers and Haseo, the main character, to figure out. The difficulty in this game was cranked up a lot from the previous version, so I've been seeing myself get game overs more often and such and it is exactly what I'm looking for.

When I explored the Grunfeld a little more, i rule out that it is a worthless opening. I now play the Modern Benoni. The Modern Benoni is excellent for agressive players and if you want to learn the opening I recommend Starting Out: The Modern Benoni. Ive had great success with this opening. Now back to the Grunfeld. The Grunfeld is bad because it lets white get a strong central advantage for no reason at all. Ive also found a few errors in this book.

nonpareil of Two Recommended Apologetics books. Craig overcompensate the topic of Apologetics in such a way that is both scholarly, but still accessable to the average person. His book is fairly technical, but not so much that a person can't grasp the overall message of the book.He writes 1 1/2 pages on Alvin Plantinga's view of epistemology.

The musical compositions sound nearly the same as the inaugural album. The beginning riff on "Your time has come" sounds very close to cochise. The lyrics are commonplace, self absorbed and meandering(kinda like soundgardens last effort). Morello took us down the same ole same ole noise road with his guitar solos.

Gregory portrays Anne as the scheming seducer, but in this movie Anne and her sister Mary are both portrayed as the dupe of Henry's lust and the rules of the lodge in which they live. I am not familiar with Bujold's work, but was impressed with such a young woman meeting Richard Burton on even ground, and even stealing the scene. As for Burton, I found it rather hard to believe him as Henry VIII, especially since the film-makers did not attempt to give him Henry's famous red-gold Tudor hair.

You amaze what you give for!. I purchased this radio to listen to FM stations while I am out locally on foot, and while traveling abroad. I tested it in my back yard. It will not strain in the three strongest FM signals from the closest transmitters. They tune in clearly on the wimpy little radio card that plugs into my old Palm Zire PDA. (That PDA has been superseded by a more powerful one with no over-the-air receiver capabilities.) Instead, the Coby attempts to tune in weaker signals from more distant transmitters that are barely audible even at high volume.Unfortunately, it comes in plastic clamshell packaging that has to be cut open. Because it has been opened, it cannot be returned for a refund. Strictly speaking, it is not defective, so it cannot be returned on those grounds, either.

Borrow a card from a friend instead of buying this one, because this is just amazing. If I could give this card a zero rating, I would, since the one I bought was faulty. Get an easier-to-operate Sony card, because with this, you have to load a special disc everytime you play. Resist the temptation if you can't find a Sony card, because this is a waste of your $[money].$LABEL$0,1,1
Product was bang-up, but the publicity is a mussiness. Box was low on one recession such that one of the cannisters was broken open and there was OK powder everywhere.$LABEL$0,1,1
To you who loved Metal in school and thought you'd outgrown. sanctum moo-cow!I'm an avid music collector, over 1000 discs now, and the first time I heed to this ane said "oh yes, this is what I have been waiting for..." I calibrate high school in the 80s and eff all the heavy metal that was popular back then. Of course as I've grown into my 30s my musical horizons have been expanded beyond belief, into jazz, ambient, alternative, space music, you name it. The other day I got my hands on this and it's just the ticket. All the technical mastery you could want, but in a band that delights in playing AS A BAND and not just shredding into oblivion like Yngwie. Crossed up with some funk and enough other influences to really keep you captivated. It's great stuff!$LABEL$1,1,0
