Birds couldn't figure it out.... I bought this feeder offline. For some reason the birds at my place couldn't even figure out how to eat out of this feeder. They would stare at the seeds longingly, sit on the window sill, and peck at the plastic. But I think I only saw one bird sucessfully eat seeds out of it. I had the same handfull of seeds in there for weeks until I just gave up and took it down.I don't think it's that my birds were too big to land on the edge. They were mostly just sparrows. Maybe it was that they couldn't really notice the clear plastic.$LABEL$0,0,-100

great photos, semi-beginner to advanced. This book came out before the huge glut, and I still like thumbing through it. The examples are marvelous. While it walks you very well through some projects, others are sort of "on your own." Good for an intermediate or advanced beader who wants to do more improvising, but might be frustrating for a new beader. I recommend learning the basic stitches elsewhere, but get this book, if only for the wonderful photos of work by very talented bead artists. It also has a useful section on balancing color and bead size, more useful information if you're ready to start personalizing your projects. It covers different stringing options well, and provides a good start for wire working. They could have left out the section on polymer clay, though.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Some Timeless, Some Outdated. Many of the articles (columnist for New York Times) in this book are outdated -- many of the wines are no longer good, the prices have tripled, many of the restaurants are no longer around, etc. However, many of the articles are timeless. They give the same advice that the current experts are giving, but in a more easily read presentation. For that, I would give it five stars, but the outdated articles pull it down to four stars. Worth checking out, especially for avid readers of wine material.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Dont't Buy this Book. Don't buy this book. Half (160 of 320 pages) is devoted to material on behavior and general characteristics, that is too simplified for a biologist (or veteran birder) and too detailed for some one seeking identification of new species. The identification sections show 7 birds per page, without size or habitat perspective. The illustrations are accurate to the extent of my observations, and range maps are shown on the ID pages. The print is about 6 point, and I simply could not read it in the field. The authors are obviously expert and anxious to please, but this book will not please anyone.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A Rip-Off. Readers should be aware that this edition of "The World As I See It" is, in fact, an abridged version of the original publication. Without bothering to mention this on the title page, it has dropped the entire fifth section on "Scientific Questions," including such classic popular expositions of Einstein's basic philosophy as "Geometry and Experience" and "Principles of Research." Editing a book of Einstein's writings which deliberately excludes all mention of science is like publishing a biography of Mozart - without any reference to music.It is, I think, significant of the dumbing down of American publishing that the German edition of the same book ("Mein Weltbild," published by Ullman) has continuously added new material on politics, fascism, Judaism, peace and science over the years! Readers who want to know what Einstein was really like should obtain a used copy of the original full version.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Bourne delivers. I am not much of a movie buff, but my husband and boys really wanted to see the Bourne series, so we watched them all.

another failure in gothic metal. Don't get me wrong -- I loved all the Sirenia albums. I loved Morten in Tristania (another band that went the same direction as Sirenia on their last release)... but this is POP. It is not metal, it is not even gothic, it's POP. No violins, no Morten doing any vocals at all (and he has a great singing voice, not just his growls). This is reminding me an awful lot of another band that went down this road -- a band called Theatre of Tragedy.If you like the old albums, don't bother buying this one. You can listen to 30 seconds of one song on this album and understand why. That's really all you need, because every song sounds exactly the same.That's all we needed, another failure in gothic metal.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Sex Is HOLY,Its More About ONENESS Than About ORGASM. Sex IS HOLY. Its for MARRIED persons ONLY. A form of worship to God. He is present when you express your love to your mate. It's about your oneness with God and your love for God. You are loving God like God loves you unconditionally when you obey Him. Sex between a husband and wife is expressing that love. Outside of marriage sex is a sin that seperates you from God. Sin is DEATH. When you love God, you love what God loves and HATES what God Hates. God Hates SIN of any kind. Fornication and adultery is sex outside of the marriage covenant. Both are sins that says I choose to seperate myself from God and DIE.$LABEL$1,0,-100
You're better off with Sayers alone. Speaking as a person who began reading Sayers' Wimsey books at the age of nine, I found the contributions of Ms. Walsh to be crudely apparent.

Beautiful music, voice, lyrics.... I saw Rachael Yamagata during the 2004 Austin City Limits Music Festival. I had no idea who she was nor did I have any idea about her music. I remember standing in front of her for about 45 minutes enjoying her music.I recently thought back to that day at ACL and looked online for her CDs. I purchased Happenstance and have fallen in love with her music and her voice. I enjoy sitting in my car and listening to this CD. Her voice is so amazing...it's strong and yet it doesn't overpower the music. Her songs cover all the different moods...sad, happy, nonchalant, angry....it's such real music.I recommend this CD to anyone who's sick of mass-produced music and wants something to remind them of how music is supposed to make you feel.I truly enjoyed this CD and am sure that if you're anything like me, you would too.

Astro Boy - The Complete Series. "Astro Boy - The Complete Series" is the best Japanese color anime treatment of Astro Boy, based on the work of the legendary manga and anime artist, Osamu Tezuka. Tezuka's work in manga and anime is unparalleld and stands alone in style and substance in this graphic Japanese genre. He is without peer in the entire ouvre of his work, especially with "Astro Boy - The Complete Series." He is in a class of his own. This is why he richly deserves the subriquette "The Walt Disney of Japan." I would heartily recommend "Astro Boy - The Complete Series" and all other works of Tezuka's which he produced over his illustrious lifetime.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Driver fans will love DRIV3R !. ....that is, IF you are able to understand that different games are DIFFERENT GAMES. Ive been a long time fan of the driver series and the gta series & love both, but all of these reviews comparing it to gta are misleading. I went against the reviews & bought it & was glad i did ! If you like the previous driver games, you will not be dissapointed with the 3rd ! The missions arent as simple as some may say, & theyre interesting as well as the story line. The handling of the cars is just like the previous driver games, great weapons, so Ive been very happy with this one. I was almost instantly addicted. My one & only very very minor complaint is that your character could run a little faster than he does, but it doesnt cause any game play issues, id just like to run faster. So yes, Driver fans buy this game & overlook any review that complains that its not grand theft auto!.....because it is not grand theft auto, its DRIV3R & its well worth the money.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Won't use anything else!. I love this foundation! It's not greasy, and the pump with the brush is fantastic - I don't have to get anything on my hands!

I found it through an in-store demo at Sephora, and bought it there a few times. In the last year or so, every time I go in there and ask for it, they have no clue what I'm talking about. Same thing with Ulta, or any other makeup store that stocks Too Faced.

Just one of a number of "ranking " books.... on the market at the same time. Ultimately subjective, but the top 10 & bottom 10 won't vary much book to book. The authors & their 700 plus historians are 20th century men & women. Many of them have their own agendas & are judging 18th & 19th century men. The times a president is elected to has everything to do with his rating. Does he rise (or fall) to the challenge? Lincoln is always #1. One reason. The Civil War. By far it is the most important event in American history. He suceeded. Nobody can predict where he would rank if the Civil War had been averted. It would not be #1.

No action, no mystery, boring characters. This book is certainly dark, which is usually a good thing, but it did nothing for this book at all. There's a boy named Nothing that has sex with any and all of his friends and does drugs. Also, an abuser character that beats up his woman, a psychic boring character named Ghost, and 3 vampires that aren't very interesting. People do drugs, kill each other, kill their best friends, sleep with their fathers, some people get pregnant, some run away from home...yawn. If this book is supposed to be interesting because it's dark and shocking, I say that isn't enough, there still has to be an entertaining plot. I didn't care who killed who in this book, the characters were all so unlikable and one dimensional. I couldn't finish it. I like dark fantasy and horror, but only if there is a plot.

Not very good. It's hard to be honest - as I really wanted to like, even love, this album just as much as their other ones - but I must be truthful, and therefore I must say this album is the worst ever.

Why, because once you put this one down, it doesn't matter what time of day it is, you will want more so why torture yourself by having to wait until the store opens?Know that the 3 primary characters of this book are so detailed that you will see a movie in your head as you read. I wrote Electa Rome Parks several years ago after reading this book to tell her that she needs to work out the movie rights NOW. Main characters would be Sanaa Lathan, Morris Chestnut, and Boris Kodjoe. Need I say more? You will not put this book down. To hell with cooking dinner, give the kids a McDonald's gift card and send them on their way so you will not be disturbed!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Finally, a charger that works with my Zen Microphoto!. My wife and I both have Zen Microphotos. She plugs hers into a stereo at work and listens to stuff all day. She's a pharmacist and works 12 hour shifts, so she needs some variety. The problem was her battery wouldn't hold up all day. We tried some cheap universal adapters that didn't work very well. I hated the thought of spending $30, but it made a huge difference. Now she can plug into the stereo and the wall and listen all day without a problem. The product works great, just wish I didn't have to spend so much$LABEL$1,0,-100
Works well, but hard to match color. We used the tub/shower repair kit this weekend. We had a short but wide crack in the top of the shower that had been there since we initially installed the shower . . . hit the corner against a 2x4. Anyway, we are preparing to sell the house and wanted to fix the crack. This product worked very well to fill the crack. It smoothed out well. The only problem, is that we could not get the color to match our beige shower, no matter how hard we tried. The color mixture always ended up looking too peachy. So we went ahead and filled the crack with the peachy mixture, then covered the peachy patch with beige fiberglass shower touch-up paint. You would never know there was a crack there before!$LABEL$1,0,-100
An over-priced wet/dry vac. We recently bought a home with a lot of ceramic floor tile, so I bought this item last January, paying around $250 for it. I am disappointed with both the quality and performance of this machine.The Hoover cleaner that it supposedly requires is expensive and not readily available. Save your money and use either Armstrong Floor Cleaner or NON sudsy ammonia. The detergent container locks securely about 30% of the time; requires multiple tries (read:spills) to make it stay on. The wand cracked after 1 use. The hose connection, like the detergent cup, does not latch securely, rendering the small tools ineffective, since the cleaner cannot be dispensed or removed. Neither the floor nor grout brush (mounted on the upright unit) is effective in cleaning the grout in between tiles.If your floor is very lightly soiled, it may work just fine. The best thing I can say about this machine is that at least you aren't using dirty buckets of water to clean your floors!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Overrated. This movie has many inaccuracies (see: movie-mistakes.com) and a weak plot, definately no epic or contender for older 'sword and sandal' films. This one has it's moments, some good dialogue, the battle scenes are very engaging, but do not show what is actually happening in them, though I'm sure people who worked on the film know. I can't believe so many people like this movie. It is too long and boring. Watch TLC and A&E instead.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Works well, no errors. Purchased in Summer '08. I've used it on laptops, my home server, and several desktops. Works fine for everything I've tried, including firmware updating and transferring old files from floppy archives. Very quiet and seems a bit faster than the internal drives I've used in the past.

not a very good movie.. I just finished watching Dogville. The concept and story are awesome. The acting and script are decent at best - I think von Trier did everything in one take and didn't care how wooden or emotionless the acting was as long as he had the shot. The use of the narrator is such a lazy thing to do - a director should show the audience what the characters are thinking and feeling, not tell them. I don't have a qualm with narrations if used only a few brief times in a film. Dogville uses narration very frequently and for no real reason other than Lars von Trier didn't feel like showing (or couldn't figure out how to show) the audience what is happening. The editing is dreadful. There are random jump cuts that exist for no reason (unlike, say, Traffic or Memento where the jump cuts make sense or at least look awesome). The film annoyed me more than it entertained me or made me think. I rate the film a 2/5, mostly for the concept and story. Dogville had so much potential.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Practical, down-to-earth, and extremely helpful. What a welcome relief from the many real estate gurus out there. Buying real estate and maintaining rental properties involves time, money, people skills and management know-how. Jorgensen doesn't offer you a get-rich scheme.

Most touching children's book. Let me echo the sentiment that children learn what we teach them; no matter how foreign it may be to us, they can grasp any idea we throw their way. Cultural issues aside, I find this the most touching young children's book I have encountered for its completely unaffected demonstration of motherly affection. And truly, the illustrations enrich the beauty of the text. For the first time in my life I purchased a book for the sole purpose of dismantling it because I wanted a framed image over my daughters' bed daily pronouncing, "I will love you forever and for always because you are my dear one." Always the best gift for new mothers!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Good photography but little factual detail. A well presented book with a wide variety of photographs making it a good source of ideas for interior designers. Beyond that there is little to commend it. Most of the pictures are not referenced, even those of grand or unique designs of fireplace.

Not a bad coffee table book but not much good if you want information on designing, building or choosing a fireplace.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not What I Expected. After being told to read this "great feminist novel" I picked it up, planning to read it on a trip. While it wasn't what I expected, I can relate to Sasha's wanting to be beautiful, but what I found annoying is her need for every man to find her desirable.

Too loud, doesn't do much. I got this thing when I first bought my 360 because of all the crap I heard about the 360 overheating. My first complaint is that the fan noise is even louder than the xbox dvd drive noise (which is pretty loud). Unless you have whatever you're playing/watching turned up pretty loud, this thing will noticably drown some of it out. I ended up taking it off because of this.As for the cooling aspect, I have played many hours both with and without this fan and have noticed no difference whatsoever. I have noticed that the air coming out of the 360 feels cooler, but the system never crashed regardless of whether I had this thing on or not.The only reason I am giving this thing 2 stars is because I would imaging if you WERE having a problem with cooling (like if you lived in a hot climate or had a lemon), then this would probably keep your xbox cooler.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I concur - DRM invalidates this purchase. ...my wife pre-ordered this for me because she knew how excited I was about the game. Just now heard about the SecuROM DRM infection though - which invalidates this as a legitimate purchase.DRM does not stop piracy. Doesn't slow them down. It does however destroy the rights of honest consumers, like me, who now no longer wants a game that was salivated over for years because the DRM infection will make the game disk worthless to me probably in a matter of months.Because of this, piracy is the better option for all. If you want to stop the DRM infection, but don't want to be a pirate, refuse to purchase this game and let it be known that the DRM is why you aren't buying it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Excellent for study. This study Bible is excellent for study, but since I wanted the large print edition, it is really too heavy to easily carry around on a regular basis.

DDR is way better even though it isn't that great at least you get a workout. If you are going to spend your well-earned $40 dollars on this game it is the same thing as flushing $40 down the toilet.

Snore!!!. I purchased Hannible the same time I picked up The Silence of The Lambs Special Edition, because of the "Save ... when you purchase both movies" coupon on the covers. Having not seen Hannibal previous to my purchase, I thought,"What the hell...I'll save a couple bucks." I could have saved the entire purchase price and rented this piece of junk. Though, it picks up where "Silence", left off, Jodi Foster isn't in it, and the plot seems dorky. Way too ... for such a dull movie.

regression. The Cranberries were once a band that had a mission to purge their souls of pain. Now the band is at the lofty heights of fame and success. As always at such altitude comes the unrelenting stressors of maniacial producers and record label executives who make unreal demands on the creative process. For many artists this can kill one's creativity. This has happened to Dolores.On top of that Dolores is now married. She seems to be happier. Happiness has a flip side for disturbed artists: it also kills their creativity!Hence, you have "Bury The Hatchet", a watered down album that is lacking in originality, added is a feeble attempt to cover up this lack of originality with the song "Copy Cat", which actually sums up the compilation of songs on this release.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Beautiful. Somehow, I always have a fondness for beautiful picture books. I always feel that a children's picture book should be something of beauty that is timeless...something that we can all treasure but something that is especially written in the straightforward language that a child understands. This is certainly not one of those mediocre, trashily illustrated, dime-a-dozen children's book. It is the uplifting story of Jessie, a girl who comes to America to begin a new life. The language is simple but beautiful, and Jessie is someone who we can all love. And the illustrations...oh!!!

The other side of Madredeus. Rodrigo Leo, amongst other adventures, has played with Madredeus for a long time. Somewhere along the way, he and accordeonist Gabriel Gomes left and, for me, the group lost a great deal of its magic ( although Gabriel is now back, on the group's latest album ). Although this is much more a classical music album than a pop one, if you get to buy it, you certainly will try to get the more recent ones. In Portugal, just a few weeks ago another one was published ( Alma Mater ) where, if you love the " old times " Madredeus, will find a soothing a reason to smile again.$LABEL$1,0,-100

One of the best !!!!. A very disturbing movie that we all should take our time to watch.Outstanding acting and a story that we all should stop in front off and appreciate how luck we are that we leave in countries there we can take the "bad guys" to justices. There is so many countries where women are not protected in the society and this movie only shows as one country.Very strong movie that should touch us all at heart, man and woman.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Carson Is King, But Show Us Something New!. This is the second time (at least) that this company has put previously released material in a new wrapper. 30 years of Carson and we keep getting a rehash (and rehash of rehash!) of previous titles. If the company and Mr. Carson's estate are too inept or lazy to dig a little deeper into the tens of thousands of hours of available Carson-era "Tonight Show" material, then just release DVDs of the old syndicated cut-up series "Carson's Comedy Classics", or even the old prime-time anniversary specials. We'd finally get to see some new material with minimal effort on the company's end.$LABEL$0,0,-100
excellent. Premium was one of the best films I saw last year.In a climate of formulaic plots and predictable storylines, I found Chatmon's writing to be authentic and CREATIVE, two elements often missing in today's cinema. I enjoyed the perfomances of the actors, especially Zoe Saldana. I don't think I have ever been moved by any of her performances until seeing Premium. I really liked her and belived her and I attribute that to direction, once again, Chatmon bringing something fresh to the screen. Dorian Missick was textured and Hil Harper, tangible.I love seeing people of color on screen with purpose and presence. This film delivers that for me and I will buy it to have it alongside the other credible films in my library.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Extreme Hastle. The 32MB capacity of this card is a great value compared to the standard PS2 memory cards. However, this is completely outweighed by the inconvenience of having to load a cd to initialize the card every time you wish to use it.

Zoom gone mad!. I bought the grdx97 camera new, back in march 2005. This past month or so, the camera has begun malfunctioning. When turned on, within a few seconds of recording, the zoom automatically starts, resulting in a blur. I tried changing the zoom feature to limit the max zoom at 12x, but still, it zooms to the max of 12x, thus limiting my ability to film anything at home.The warranty is labor 3monts, parts 1 year. There is no customer service I can talk to at the toll free JVC number. Therefore, I have to drive to the nearest service center which is apparently an independent business. All of the service centers are > 30 minutes away.I never thought I would be having problems 5 months after purchase!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Not the best, but close. This isn't the best Bad Religion album, but it's pretty close. All the songs are good, but some just aren't that memorable and sound a little repetitive to me after a while. There's a lot of good songs here though; my favorites are "Recipe for Hate", "Kerosene", "American Jesus", "Watch it Die", and "Don't Pray on me."This is a good album if you are a Bad Religion fan, and a pretty decent introduction to the band. However, I recommend Generator, Stranger than Fiction, and 80-85 over this. Still pretty darn good though.$LABEL$1,0,-100
An Exceptional Film. Set in the state of Georgia, James Garner renders a powerful and very sensitive performance of a Judge who following the death of his wife, retires from the bench. He tries to with-draw from life esconced in his own grief and bitterness. The mys-tery surrounding an old friend's refusal to accept the Congressional Medal of Honor, and the personal crises in the lives of those closest to him, compel him to step back into the mainstream of society . As he reaches beyond his own pain and into lives of others, he not only becomes an anchor for them, but finds a renewed reason for living, himself.The supporting cast is superb, esp. Bill Cobbs and Ruby Dee.This is an exceptional film, providing wholesome entertainment.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Lovely but for the static electricity.. I've been using my burr grinder for about a year now. The good news is that it grinds the beans perfectly every time. The bad news is that it's a mess to clean (necessary every couple weeks) and worst of all, the grinding creates so much static electricity that when you remove the reservoir from the machine, there is a small burst of grounds that explodes from it and ends up on the machine and the counter. If you live in an area with high humidity, this might not be such a problem. But, if you live in a dry area (here in California, it's dry from May to October), then static will be a headache.Capresso could probably correct this by making the little bin out of metal instead of plastic so the static would discharge through the machine.Otherwise, it's a wonderful device and I recommend it if you're fussy about your coffee.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A wonderful version of a classic tale. Polacco's book is a time honored theme, this retelling from the Ukraine. When Luba saves the Wren's life her parents insist she return to ask for a favor. The parents never seem to be satisfied and send Luba back time and time again. In the end the parents are returned to the happy couple they were when they started. This book can be successfully compared with any of the many available versions of the Fisherman and His Wife but also contains elements from The Stonecutter -- another tale available in several versions. Sometimes those with seemingly little power/wealth think other situations would make them a different person or happier. And when they do obtain power their humility is lost. Satisfaction seldom comes when one has not earned that power or wealth. Polacco's wonderously beautiful watercolors brings this theme into the full vision of readers. A delightfully new twist on a classic tale.$LABEL$1,0,-100
For the Tintin fan who has all the books. My family collected Tintin and Asterix books when I was growing up. My parents have a complete set as do several of my sisters.

Standells - 'Hot Ones' (Sundazed) 2 1/2 stars.

Boring. Tetris is awesome. I could play that time waster all day - but something is amiss with this game and it manages to make me not want to play.It could be the loud thumping synth and techno music that plays in the background on infinte loop, or it could be the fact that they attempted to add a story to Tetris by adding strange "creatures" that speak a more annoying version of Animal Crossing's babelese, it could be that the colors look like they have been washed out and are difficult to tell apart, or it could be that there are barely any modes to play except marathon tetris games.I think the real reason is that they just botched it.

Doesn't work for everyone!. My two year old daughter has been sucking the middle two fingers of her left hand since just hours after her birth. To avoid future embarassment for her and high orthodontia bills for me, I bought Mavala Stop to coat her fingers. The first night, my daughter DID keep the treated fingers out of her mouth. The next night, I found her sucking those fingers. The third night, after my daughter's bath, I coated her fingers again.

It probably costs them $[...] dollars to make a router and they're selling it for $[...] and not only supporting it for a year hoping that when it fails you'll have to buy another one.

A week later and my Mx500 arrived..this is where the problem started. I noticed the pointer moves in random directions when you move the mouse slowly. I thought that this was because the mouse had some tiny scratches on it. So i cleaned it and used it again..no luck.Today i went to staples to have it exchanged for a similar mousepad.

Jumpstart Games are Great for Little Scholars!. This title is third in the Jumpstart series of learning games (it starts with Toddlers) and is typical of the high quality, fun learning games produced by Knowledge Adventure. The characters are engaging for the designated age group, and the activities are both fun and encourage learning. The game increases the levels depending on your child's skill (not by a preset formula) making them more or less challenging depending on the individual, and the progress report helps you see exactly what areas your child needs help in. This software is a great compliment to the Jumpstart series of workbooks. Highly recommended!!$LABEL$1,0,-100
is this really what teenage life is about?. I think that after reading this book and many other so called teenage life books, i relized that this is not really what life is for me. yes there are a few incidents when i want a boy friend, or i kiss a guy, but it is not always the most interesting thing to read over and over again in every "teen" book. Prep is kind of like that. Highschools are not all perfect, they have their flaws to them. Like crime or racists. Every teen book so far has been about the better off people, how about writing one about some people on the streets or the hood. They have stories too. they aren't just people reading stories, they probably want to read one that relates to them. Again if you want another pathetic teen book, read prep!$LABEL$0,0,-100

However, this film is so strangely cobbled together that I think if I didn't know the novel so well I would have had no idea what was going on. Motivation, character, and relationships need to be developed even if they diverge from the original, but the characters here were mostly two dimensional, and inconsistent.

I would not buy an overly costly Calphalon non stick product again. All my pots and pans are starting to show signs of deteriation. Not what I expected for my $500.00 investment.$LABEL$0,0,-100
4 1/2 stars. if you're looking to add some vibes to your jazz collection, this is a fine fine album, and would make a good choice. mr hutcherson is a fantastic vibes player, and is joined here by herbie hancock on piano, bob cranshaw on bass, and joe chambers on drums. the entire album is special, but the tune that i really want to give a shout out about is "bouquet," a stunningly gorgeous slow-tempo piece that has soul-stirring interplay between the bass and vibes. one of my favorite slow jazz numbers of all-time. if you are considering picking up a copy of this album, i say "do it!"$LABEL$1,0,-100

GREAT Beginner Pilates DVD. I hurt my feet and couldn't do the usual workouts so I turned to pilates. I am very much a beginner and this DVD was FANTASTIC!!! She explains everything well but doesn't over do it. The full workout takes about 31min. and there is a bonus workout but I haven't tried it yet because it looked like there was going to be some standing moves and I have to stay off my feet :-( I'm used to sweating and panting during my workouts and this doesn't do that (I glisten a bit). I've been doing this 2-3 times a week for about a month now and I still enjoy doing it. If you are a beginner to pilates this is a great place to start.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Wait till they lower the price or hire a proofreader...... I was genuinely distracted from the content as I found myself reading every page "looking for more typos, inaccurate facts, etc". Many are noted in previous reviews....Butch Harmon is referred to as Bruce....David Duval is later called Davis....etc. I do not know the publishing process but I would think an author should have a vested interested in proofing his product....as well as many others. It is obviously an effort to cash in (the book itself had interesting facts, if you can trust themmmmm)......but also seemed disjointed and like it was slapped together without connection between chapters....bottom line - an inferior quality product given it is a 24 dollar hardcopy new book......wait for the next revision......$LABEL$0,0,-100
Buy the separate Widescreen releases instead!. It puzzles me why Fox only chose to offer a PAN-AND-SCAN box of the first two Star Wars prequels.If you're a fan of these films, it's much better to buy the separate widescreen releases of each. You won't get the pretty slipcase, but at least you're getting the whole movie and not a butchered pan-and-scan version.It is rumored that when Episode III comes out on DVD this November, Fox will release a box set of all three prequels in their proper Widescreen Anamorphic format. Hopefully that rumor is true. (Though, since I already own the WS versions of Episodes I and II, I'll forgo the box and pick up the regular release of III.)$LABEL$0,0,-100

poor sizing, feels like it will fall off.. These were poorly sized. They fit fairly tight until the middle of your palm but flare out from there instead of at the wrist like your typical slip on glove. They also have no elastic to hold them on your wrist. The gloves feel like they will fall off, and easily fill up with leaves/debris/etc. They do not give a sure fit and feel.

very helpful - now you can play gameboy all the time.... the good news is that you can play gameboy all the time. this little gadget plugs neatly into a side socket and provides a nice light to make the screen usable. there is definitely a reflection that is a bit annoying, but careful positioning of the light source seems to help. it pops out easily and is quite portable, so you don't mind carrying it around. and, from what i can see, it doesn't seem to drain batteries noticeably faster. although you will play more and longer, so expect to be using up more of those puppies...the bad news is that you can (and in my case - will) play more often. plus, it's easy to hold on to, so the kids can sneak into easily under the covers when they're supposed to be going to sleep. however, in the grand scheme of things, these are the prices we pay for an ever-evolving society.for the price, it's a handy addition. if you haven't already, go ahead and splurge.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Simplistic, but it has a message. This is a very small and not overly challenging book with a simplistic message. Underneath the fable of the mice and the men, Johnson is dealing with change: how change can come with little warning, how different people react differently to change, how people prefer to be snug and safe and therefore fear change. The cheese here is an allegory for whatever you may value, be it money, relationships, even just cheese! What happens when your cheese suddenly vanishes and you cannot seem to get it? Do you sit and wait in the hope it will return? Do you try to find out what happened and thereby get hold of some more cheese? The book has a message so do not get put off by the fable format. What seems to be obvious and common sense is not always so in real life and sometimes a silly fable helps like a poke in the ribs. Worth a read but I find the bestseller rankings hard to believe!$LABEL$0,0,-100
One Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. I got this book a bit back but ever since then I have been rereading it. It is simply one of Misty's great books. Kero (or Kerowyn) is a strong female who can take care of herself. Thank you for that. She always stands up for what she believes in and doesn't let mn push her around or take advantage of her just because she is a woman. And even though she isn't exactly feminine, she still wants love. Or at least with Eldan. This book was a great one. I would recomend that you read it when you get a chance.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Highly grateful for this product.. When our 12 year old dog began limping periodically we discovered he had arthritis. 300mg of enteric aspirin was suggested. We were also told that the human variety was acceptable. It worked great for the arthritis, but it upset his stomach and he stopped eating about 2/3 of his normal amount. I found this product here at Amazon and decided to give it a try. Since the aspirin is chewable, we decided to start with 1/2 a tablet to see how it worked. He's doing great now, eating better than ever, is much more active and far less "grumpy". I would recommend this to anyone with a dog in need of pain relief because it is chewable (therefore you can reduce the dose) and doesn't upset their stomachs as the human type so often does.$LABEL$1,0,-100

So Glad for the "Official" Bonanza dvds!!. I am the happy purchaser of Official Season 1 volumes 1 & 2 and also the Official Season 2 volumes 1 & now 2.I had purchased the german dvds as the original music was on them, unlike all the other dvds of Bonanza circulating round the USA and found in dollar bins etc.But these "Official" ones are well worth the price. Firstly, for me, they have captioning, which is a boon for those with hearing losses and they naturally have the original music scores and are uncut.But they also come with great extras! There are still b&w; pix from behind the scene shootings, there are publicity clips (a video of a Rose Bowl Parade appearance in the most recent), comments from the producer, Mr Dortort, voice overs from guest stars and stuntsmen etc with tidbits about the shows, the actors and the production.For the Bonanza fan, this is MUST HAVE item. And I can only hope that more dvds for other seasons will be produced and in the same manner.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The keypad failed first time out. I'm sure Garrett makes a good product all in all, but the one I purchased, a Garrett GTI 1500, failed on the first time out. In order to pinpoint and look a the size of your target, you have to press and hold the "treasure imaging" button on the keypad. Well, this particular keypad and button was poor quality and the button got stuck in the activate mode. I had to send the detector back. I recently paid more money for a different and better quality detector, and the extra money has been worth every penny. I'm not saying this is a bad detector and the one I purchased may have just been a lemon, but you get what you pay for.The refunding experience was OK. I had to send several emails and make several phone calls, but in the end, I was refunded. Garrett complained because I used a different box to return the detector, but the original box was so beat up when I received the package that I couldn't re-use it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

An Absolute Joy to Play!. I purchased Civ IV for my nephew at Christmas and we had so much fun playing together and separate, when I can get him off of it, that I decided to go for the expansion. We still enjoy playing the hot seat together as well as separately conquering the game.This new installment adds some more features and characters to it. Which equates to more fun. New leaders add another bit of that fun spice to the game. Graphics are awesome. We use an iMac and love the way the whole thing looks. We have watched all of the "wonders" videos and still find that we like to re-watch them every time we play.For people who enjoy strategy games this is a must as far as expansion packs go. If you don't have Civ IV yet get it and enjoy it.I gave this game 4 stars for the fact that there is always room to expand.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Now that I am much older and more experienced (presumably) I can review each episode with more insight thanks to the rewind button on my DVD PLAYER.

1/2 Good. So maybe I'd give it 2-1/2 stars if it was possible.The good: The visual. Very stark. Very arresting.The bad: You HAVE to convince yourself to leave believability at the door. From beginning to end.Yeah, yeah, I know this is comic book stuff. But to sit through two hours of getting beaten over the head with over the top violence gets pretty damned dull for the viewer. In my case it took me only 30 minutes to pull the plug on my DVD. Why? Because Rourke's superhuman character gets pulverized by a speeding car THREE times and walks away virtually unscathed, save for a bloodied face. But then, a few scenes later, get's knocked UNCONSCIOUS by a sledgehammer to the noggin.Huh? Direct impact by a speeding automobile inflicts almost zero bodily harm, but a hand held piece of hardware k.o.'s him?!?Safe to say I won't finish this movie anytime soon. If ever.

Not the best HP but it kept me reading furiously. This is a great Harry potter book. My only problem was with the ending. Yes, I am sad about the major death, but that is not my issue with it. i was upset that it ended so abruptly after the death. At the end of most of the books, everything gets explained and you are left with a feeling that most things will go back to normal for him. This book makes it clear that things will be different in the next book, which makes it suck that we will have to wait another ~2 years to find out what happens.

Fun, fun, fun, (again, again and again!). Like all of the books in the "Puzzle" series this book on its first reading kept my children (6 and 4 years) occupied for an age. However what sets these books apart from other "look and find" puzzle books is their ability to be re-read again and again. Even though both my children know all the answers and where the "hidden" objects are, these books are read at several times a week at least!What is especially nice about this book is that the main characters of the story are two females, a young girl and a mermaid.

Cookware Much Too Small. I bought this cookware for my 3-year-old grandaughter, who was completely disinterested in the toy. For a start, the pots and pans are too small to actually "pretend cook" with. I also bought another item from Small World Living Toys; plastic veggies, that I assumed were shown with the cooking set.

Very good, practical information. There are not many books available about garden photography and this one will be a welcome addition. It is filled with outstanding photos and practical advice. The author explains the usual dilemmas with film, cameras, composition, etc. but also includes very good information about labeling, storing and organizing your work (a link is included for a software program that I was not aware of - thank you!).I bought this book mainly, however, for learning more about taking nature photos with a digital camera. While the author raves about the digital format and even confesses that he uses digital for most of his work now, there are only 2 photos in the entire book (out of hundreds) taken with a digital camera.

Ocean's 12 lacks the fun of its predecessor, Ocean's 11, mostly because there really AREN'T 12 master thieves running amok....most of the cast spends their time sitting in a cell, an extremely poor decision on the director's part. Where's the humor of Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac and the Mormon Twins? Locked up for half the movie!The story theme is great: Benedict knows who ripped him off, and the insurance payment isn't enough to soothe his wounded ego; he wants it back from the thieves. Another master thief issues a challenge to the team: steal a Faberge egg before I do, and I'll pay your debt for you. The director and screenwriters lose it from there, though, by separating everyone.Still, the movie has its moments, with Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts, and a witty cameo by Bruce Willis. The ending leaves an opening for Ocean's 13, and let's hope they get a bit better script next time around.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Love it! A must have for any woman. This is a great book with great illustrations done by the author. I really enjoyed reading it, it gives a woman a lot of different advice with out being too preachy. I have always really enjoyed Anna Johnson's writing. It is not serious, nor is it uppity or snobby. The book offers realistic, doable advice for women of all ages. It covers topics such as fashion, food, entertaining, and beauty. She has some great advice especially when it comes to dressing chicly, decorating your home on a budget. It also has some nice sections on being spiritual and giving back to your community, which I think is rare in books like this. It also encourages women to be modern women. It's not a book that expects you know know to to cook, or even to look good all of the time, just to have fun and take life with a grain of salt.$LABEL$1,0,-100
They're even better live.... Just adding my .02 to all the rest of you great SW fans who've been here before me. I heard SW on the radio back in the early 90's..."What do I have to do?" from W,B,B+P and I just loved it. Bought the CD and loved the whole thing esp. "So Wrong". Then, 4 long years later comes "Darkest Days" and it blows W,B,B+P away! And I have the chance to see them up close and personal in a small local club. And let me tell you if you don't know: they rock live! The energy, the sound, the light-show! What a blast! And their sound was awesome-- so often bands just tyr to be so loud, but they were perfect. you could understand almost every word Chris Hall uttered and hear every spooky effect from the keyboards and programming. If they're coming to you town (check Stabbing Westward www.stabbingwestward.com if that html don't work) go and SEE THEM you will not be disappointed. Save Yourself!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Should work very well on wood but not grout. I returned this item. But I can't give it a bad review just because it doesn't work on grout. I didn't open it, it was my neighbor who suggested that *maybe* it won't work on grout. So instead of opening it up and not working and then unable to return it, I just returned it.I'm sure it will work great on wood, terracotta, etc. But I doubt it will work on unsmooth surfaces such as grout.

Not Recommended for Educators. I am a gang and youth violence expert working with the San Diego County Office of Education, Safe Schools Unit. I have alerted many of our schools about the series of books by Stanley "Tookie" Williams. I do not recommend the purchase of this book. The content of the books are not appropriate for young people. The images of gangs are not accurate (Too much negative sterotyping). The book is written in a simplistic style that will quickly bore young students.

Shallow. I have liked all the Janette Oke books I have read except for this one. It was shallow and disappointing. For one thing, I thought it was unrealistic that a woman would have a freight run in the "olden days". Also, the ending wasn't complete enough, like the other reviewers said. It also seemed inconsistant that a supposedly Godly man like Seth would fall for a snobby city-slicker like Rebecca (before she had her change of heart). And was Sarah ever going to marry Boyde? I thought that this book was uncharacteristically shallow and had a lack of spiritual depth unlike Janette Oke's other books. I really enjoyed her Seasons of the Heart series and A Bride for Donnigan.$LABEL$0,0,-100

liberal spin gone wild... this is pure propaganda. as a previous reviewer said, the author has spun the facts to his liking. the cherry tree has been known to be a myth for many years. so what?he wrote the rules for civility. he voluntarily gave up power when they wanted to give him even more. he 'led from the front'.the history channel and natgeo have sold out to liberalism. liberalism is both immoral and uneconomic. liberals hate men like washington, jefferson and madison and will do anything they can to denigrate them.notice how often the narrator says 'the man' instead of 'washington'. this denotes the lack of respect he has for washington.the author is an ugly man and i'm getting real tired of these liberal distortions.thanks to all the fine people that took the time to speak out against this garbage. you guys are patriots. we can only thank our lucky stars we had a founder like george washington.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Drama at Eyam. Having visited Eyam, the Plague Village, Brooks described Anna's town and the spread of disease in the village with right amount of creepiness I felt at the real village. The simple prose has been admonished by some reviewers as poor description and character building, asking for more flowery language. First of all, this book is about the plague and from the perspective of a simple woman--not a noble woman with delicate sensibilities. I appreciated the down to earth style of writing, as the character, Anna, appears to be a `down to earth' kind of woman. She is an incredibly strong character, even though she demonstrates some poor judgement with her choice of lover--but haven't we all made poor life decisions? True, the ending of the book is rather farfetched for the time period , but the book is still an entertaining read.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Awful. I'm normally very cautious when purchasing new hardware and I always shop around for the best deals. In this case, though, I rushed in like a fool and bought this for $50 at Office Depot b/c I really needed Internet access at my new place.This adapter is horrible. It's supposed to get a very strong signal from where I am, but its signal strength is always low when plugged directly into my motherboard. When plugged into a USB 2.0 extension cable, I get very good or excellent signal strength, but it will often lose the signal when under heavy load.

You have GOT to be kidding.... ....The Rudolph special being sold here is definitely ... a "hipper, cooler" yet woefully inadequate sequel. To be fair, I haven't seen this 'movie' yet. However, based on the past dreck that GoodTimes Entertainment has slopped on the table (the feature-length Rudolph they produced was enough to make even the most clueless animation fan gag), I can't imagine that this offering could be any better. I suppose that their earlier Rudolph taught them a lesson which is why the appearance of the classic characters can be seen here. But computer animation? And a pink hippo? Haven't these execs learned anything?!? You want us to buy this garbage? Fine. Spend some time to craft a STORY that stands on its own and hire a good team of stop-motion animators to do some solid work.

So much unrealized potential.... Left Behind was one of the most amazing books I have ever read. What was so amazing about it was that it was Christian and yet it was still QUALITY. I cannot say the same for the film. The film tries HARD but misses the mark. Kirk Cameron puts in a decent performance as Buck Williams and Chloe is also played well.... but Rayford Steele? Who is this guy? It is one of the WORST performances I have ever seen in my life. I laughed out loud as he delivered some of his lines. For someone who was supposed to have just met the Creator of heaven and earth, he was surprisingly stoic...I could go on... but why? The filmmakers tried. It wasn't a complete waste, but if you haven't read the book, prepare to be LOST. They crammed 400 pages into 95 minutes... I gave them two stars for trying.

The Red King. To the reader,The Red King is not entirely interesting, in fact its not interesting at all. This book is based around a girl who can do everything (well almost everything) nothing stops her. A greedy thief takes her forcefully under his wing, she is a slave. She is offered freedom (for a price). The once pleasant Red King is causing harm to those who don't obey him.Classic fantasy. Good guy joins with relatively good guy, they cross lands together so as to thwart the evil "baddy" who is not as evil as they thought. People die, people get hurt, people are happy etc.I would have thought Victor (with the reputation he has) could surely do better than this. I expect that he didn't take too long to do this book.

good idea, poorly executed. The Wrap worked great for me for the first couple years of use, though the plastic that houses the key and remote is of poor quality and started to fall apart after several months. No big deal, the key still worked. Until... last week, the lock somehow jammed, and I was unable to unlock the Wrap from my steering wheel. I struggled with it for quite some time and even called the 1-800 number on the key. Of course, no one answered. I left a message in a panic, and, of course, no one returned my call. The only way to remove the Wrap was to cut it open and dismantle the lock. The bf brought out his drill and chipped away at the metal and plastic. About an hour later, with a mess of metal and plastic shavings blanketing the car's interior, we removed the Wrap. Overall, a horrible experience. I would never recommend the Wrap to anyone and am searching for a new security device. Suggestions?$LABEL$0,0,-100

Any hairball keeps the rubber diaphragm flap thing open or clogs the opening or tube to the dirt holder area. I have to keep emptying the chamber (at least a dozen times)to try to complete sweeping a 1400 sq ft area. I've given up & will give this away to someone who doesn't have pets.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Loud and Ineffective. I should have known better, because portable air conditioners have such a bad reputation... but I needed to use one thanks to an odd (and unchangable) window configuration. So I trusted that Sears (which sells this model for $499) wouldn't steer me wrong. Shame on me. I should have paid attention to the Consumer Reports reviews -- and now you should pay attention to mind: The unit is entirely inadequate for cooling a 12 by 18 foot room... and it is LOUD. The sales information touts it as "quiet," but you won't be able to sleep in a room with it. The internal "evaporator" recycles water over the cooling coils, and the pump that does that makes an annoying whirring sound that'll drive a sane person batty. Yikes. I made a mistake buying this clunker. Time to soak up the 15% restocking fee and get this thing back to Sears.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Far fetched at best. I too bought this book because of its link to Michael Jackson's life. I was rather surprised at the trauma and life experiences in this woman's life.

And if you don't believe me just look at all the other reviews.

silly. This book was just plain silly. The plot was about a woman who thought that she could pretend to be her twin sister that she NEVER met. When people were suspicious of her she believed that it was because they had something to do with her sisters disappearance. It never once occured to her that people were suspicious because she did a crappy job of trying to be her sister. Turns out just about everyone who was close to the sister knew all along. Why they all pretended not to know comes out later. Most of it in invovles her being manipulated by her new found father who she forgives immediately for keeping her sister but putting her up for adoption. Ms Summers also does a very boring job writing in first person.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Disappointing. Having read all the glowing reviews about this series I shelled out quite a bit to buy the videos and get them shipped to me in Australia. I shouldn't have bothered. The programmes are so disjointed and badly put together. (Eg, we hear about one colour, jump to two separate topics, come back to another colour five minutes later, jump to a completely separate topic, etc) The constant talking is SO grating, too. My toddler refuses to watch them and I too find them confusing and annoying. There's a bit of everything but not enough of anything, it's so poorly structured that I can't see how it could teach a child anything (I am an elementary school teacher) and in fact the jumping between topics could be counter-productive instead.

All over the road on acid. I had a problem with this film. The film is based on short stories by Denis Johnson. The movie should have been more shorts with different characters. The flow of it makes you lose characters you grow accustomed to, the drugged out hospital orderly, the AA woman etc, even the Amish women he is involved with in his own way doesn't really evolve the way it should. There are many classic and memorable scenes to enjoy. The ER scene where the two characters get wacked on hospital drugs then have to deal with an emergency is extremely well done. The rest is a mixed bag, shaken not stirred of drug abuse, death and perhaps redumption. I'm sure the book of the same name is a much more valuable purchase.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Too much emphasis on theory, not enough hands on. The beginning of the ninth chapter is over 200 pages into the book and it begins like this. "Many people who read reference manuals such as this one often want to start "doing" right away, rather than read through the explanations until a complete understanding is in place beforetaking any action." Anyone who reads through the first 8 chapters will have become more than just a little impatient at the repetitive and long winded theoretical concepts that could have been scaled down to 2 chapters. Building on a theoritcal foundation is essential. However, way too much time and energy is focused in this area IMO.$LABEL$0,0,-100

explains key ideas. In a relatively compact book, Diwekar manages to give detailed explanations of key methods in modern optimisation. These include simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. The former are inspired by ideas in statistical mechanics, and the latter by evolution.Monte Carlo sampling is another important idea well described here. It uses a pseudo-random number generator that approximates a uniform distribution over [0,1] to do probabilistic analysis in the common case when analytic answers are unavailable.The narrative gives the reader an appreciation of what problems these methods can be used against, and also of the computational complexity of each method.$LABEL$1,0,-100

At Last Available. Finally this masterpiece is available. It wasn't ever on VHS. LADIES IN RETIREMENT has one memorable line. "Once you sell your soul to the devil, it's so much easier the second time. The way that it's delivered by Ms. Ida Lupino you'll never forget it. She was probably the most under rated actress in Hollywood history. She was just brilliant in this. Ida conveyed many varied emotions quite well. How she was not nominated for an OSCAR, I'll never know? The plot to me is quite believable but still entertaining. With today's movies, the plot goes over the top too often. Lupino is forced. to to do something horrible and then regrets it. The way the story unravels it's logical and satisfying. TCM does show this but its worth owning. They should put it in their essentials show. Maybe Ida Lupino was not a better actress than either of the Hepburns or Bette Davis, but they weren't any better than she was.$LABEL$1,0,-100

This isn't Jane Austen!. extremely bad production of probably one of Austen's best written, if not most likeable books. The names and a few of the basic plot points are the same, but other than that, there's no similarities. They made Sir Thomas, who was basically a good man, although somewhat reserved and unbending, into a borderline lecher, they tried to mix Fanny Price and Jane Austen, and I don't think there was much of Fanny in Jane Austen.

Sales are not indicative of how great this album is!. This album may not have sold particularly well, but it is his best collection of songs in his career thus far. It's a real shame that Decca folded. This album has a ton of great songs on it. I like the songs "Better Than It Used To Be", "Happy As We Wanna Be", and "She's Got Everything Money Can't Buy". The best songs on the album, however, are "More Than Everything", "What Livin's All About" (and yes, Lovin's what livin IS all about), and the killer finale, "The Rest Of Forever", a beautiful song about two broken hearts who have to learn how to trust in love again, which is never easy to do. With the exception of "I'll Be Right Here Lovin' You", which is extremely corny, this is a great album from start to finish. Get another record deal, Rhett.

The travellor misses nothing because full colored pictures assist in the discovery. No other information is needed including maps and museum pamphlets.

Disappointed. One of the reasons that I got a Kindle was as a convenient reading device when carrying a laptop isn't practical. I have a weekend print subscription to the NY Times, and I thought that would extend to cover the Kindle version. However, unlike what I thought I read on the NY Times "Digital Subscription" web page, it turns out I have to pay for a second subscription if I want the "e-reader" version in addition to the print version.I thought about switching entirely from my print subscription to the "e-reader" subscription, but that would be a significant downgrade since the "e-reader" edition (a) is missing a LOT of articles that I enjoy (e.g. Science, Technology, David Pogue ....), and (b) is only updated daily. I've decided that I'm better served by keeping the print subscription, reading the NY Times website when I can, and canceling the Times subscription for my Kindle.In summary, the Kindle version of the NY Times is a complete failure for me.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Lovely. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that this book was so short. I actually made myself stop reading the first night I got it because I did not want it to end so fast.I think that the author could have written much more with the plot... a girl talking to an angel about heaven, an angel asking a girl about life on earth...there is a lot of room for discussion. The ending was very abrupt. Even so, Mr. Gaarder shares some lovely ideas through the words of Cecilia (the main character). This book had a few moments that reminded me of Sophie's World, something totally bizarre that made me literally stop, and think. I love Mr. Gaarder's style, it is almost magical.My only regret is that I read this book in just 2 nights, but I am certain I will read it again. I highly recommend it!!$LABEL$1,0,-100

a rushed work to say the least....

Initially the strong premise and requisite eccentric characters draw you in but the plot of the novel never comes into complete fruition and the reader is left unfulfilled and sorely disappointed to the point of frustration.Worth the read?

Tragically disappointing. I can see I'm not the only one. What the heck happened here? The visual quality of one my favorite childhood movies is pathetic. The picture is so dark that most of the movie is unwatchable. I found myself not even looking at the screen, but merely listening to the dialog and shaking my head in sorrow at the ruined treasure.More, when the action gets busy, like when fire is swirling around, the picture is pixelated.Third, I counted at least four times where the content skipped or repeated. There are no scratches on the disk, and these instances did not occur during the "commercial break" parts. Gandalf's line about Mirkwood was cut off midway through his sentence, the content mysterious gone, and Bard's welcoming the dwarves to Laketown repeated twice. It's like an incompetent rip-job off YouTube.This is the lousiest conversion to DVD I have ever encountered, and it makes me so upset that anyone would put out something of this quality and expect money for it.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Slow, boring, with a lot of questions left in my head!. Like the title says...this movie is very slow moving and the plot is very boring. Then when the end comes along you expect something great, but no, just a bland ending to a bland movie. Perhaps if you like to look at movies on a "deeper" level than simple entertainment you might possibly find this movie interesting. The only plus side of this was the fine acting of the character Truman Capote. He kept the annoying voice consistant throughout the film and the consistancy of lacking almost any emotion was done quite well.$LABEL$0,0,-100
hot pads, hot pan holders. These are typical of these silicone pads. I have several different sizes and shapes, now. They are stiff at first, but become somewhat more pliable. The color is very nice. A nice, muted yellow, more like the fading yellow of autumn fields. They work very well for my needs - hoisting big pans full of meat or roasting vegetables. They also make nice hot pads on the cabinet top for smaller hot dishes. I really like these silicone cooking utensils for their ease of cleaning.

These are decent renditions of material from The Roller's first two Christmas releases, they stand as proof that Chip & Co can do their stuff live, but the finale "Going To Another Place" isn't a holiday number, it's the finale from the "Fresh Aire II" release. Granted, it makes a good, bouncy sendoff from a live show after their pensive arrangement of "Silent Night", but its very existence proves that these guys could have come up with an upbeat prog lite instrumental that isn't a remake of a traditional Christmas song (e.g. "Deck the Halls"). If they were too late to get it on the third "Christmas In the Aire", they could have made it exclusive to this release.$LABEL$1,0,-100
From Dawn to Dusk: Autobiography of Judith Hubback. This is an autobiography of an early and prominent analytical psychologist in the U.K. Her life spanned much of the 20th century, and she emerged through the various changes that women went through during that century to become a well known analytical psychologist, poet,wife, mother, grandmother, and writer.The autobiography is very well written, and will interest those interested in analytical psychology and the emergence of the feminist movement in England.$LABEL$1,0,-100
One of my top 5 albums. I've been listening to SR-71 for 5 years now, and their first album is still (by far) my favorite. It is the perfect mix of pop and punk - something no other band seems to have gotten right. I never get tired of this album, my favorite songs being the entertaining 'Politically Correct' and 'Alive' - a ballad of strength in the face of physical abuse. I can't say enough good things about this CD, the only disappointment is that SR-71's following albums couldn't match its calibur.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Humane master of the sardonic. Jake Thackray's lyrics are literate and his music is melodic and stylish. These are not fashionable qualities but if wit and style have any meaning, this is where you come to hear them. Thackray has the audacity to suggest that women are garrulous, sex is fun and people enjoy themselves quietly in eccentric and humane ways without reference to the Social Services. I have been trying to work out why this is not folk music and all I can say is that he does not take his work seriously and he treats us like adult human beings. That is art but not the lah di dah sort..$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great photos!. This book has a lot of great photos, mostly in color. The information is pretty good, but there are some areas that seem to have gaps in the narrative. I also would have liked more in-depth information relating to Hasbro instead of mostly the kind of information that you can get from a list. The book tells you when everything was released, what year, who did what, etc. But it lacks any human warmth, and there are really no warm stories of the original creators sitting together and working on GI Joe. Sadly, most of the GI Joe books totally ignore the human factor, aside from giving credit to the names of the people who designed, invented, patented, painted, funded, etc. The book is great for photos, and lots of interesting information. Sadly, it is not a warm, fuzzy book about a children's toy!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Mystery, yes. Sci Fi, no.. I expected a science fiction story, therefore I was disappointed that it read more like a mystery novel, or maybe just fiction. Alan Dean Foster is an excellent writer, however, and so I enjoyed the book from that standpoint. I would have enjoyed it more if the characters and the extraordinary events they faced didn't sound like the usual melodrama that I read in the newspapers every day. Sometimes I just like to get a break from the turmoil this world is in and I am afraid this book kept me right here on planet Earth.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Awww..... maaaannnnn. Honestly, my son and I really enjoyed this flick.However, the movie foreshadowed itself from the beginning (for me) but left my teen aged son wondering if I was clairvoyant. Too many times I voiced the next line in the movie to the point my boy asked me "are you sure you haven't seen this before?!?"No, just that "been there, seen that" atmosphere that pervades this film, even if it's told from a different point of view. It did have some different elements missing from stories of this type, just enough to make it enjoyable for both of us.Good, silly fun. Enjoy!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Final Fantasy this ain't. Well, where do I begin? I've played many RPG's in my gaming life, but i have never come across one so unimpressive and disappointing as Grandia II. Yes, I understand that this is a port from an older version, but that's no excuse for the mundane audio and visual aspects of what could have been a decent game. This game clearly does not utilize the full potential of what the PS2 can accomplish. The voice-acting where horribly done, and the graphics appear like the lowly N64 could've pulled it off. The story wasn't that great either, and this is a key aspect in creating a good rpg. The battle system however, worked fairly well. It provides a nice change from the average "stand still, attack, move back to position, wash, rinse, repeat." It did, however, move a bit too slow for me. All in all, you're better of with the Final Fantasy series. This one's a rental.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Quality is Missing. I love Martex Velllux Blankets. You could say I am addicted to them -- I have them in more than a handful of colors. But this recent purchase was way below par.

Professional, predictable, and pedantic.. Starswarm was written by someone who has fabricated several pounds of novels and read even more. The plot has been used in dozens of novels and hundreds of video games and thousands of movies. Viz: Plucky youth with secret identity sneaks thru villains to find the holy grail, claim his birthright, and win the girl.In this case the hero Kip is a "prince of the blood" gone into hiding with a faithful retainer, and a "magic" helper. An ursurper is on his tail. At no time is there any suspense. At no time is any character other than a cardboard cut-out. At no time is the history and society of Kip's world other than briefly sketched in.Been there, done that, have the T-shirt.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Anyone can sing, but should they?. Tom Wopat has always been a very likeable guy and to tell you the truth, I wae really looking forward to this CD considering the choice of selections. Starting with the packaging I was very impressed with the presentation. I had seen him perform on the Tonys and thought he was having a ball, if not quiet on pitch with his fellow performers. I had heard he was performing in several Broadway productions and cabarets recently and assumed he had gotten much more comfortable with singing. Unfortunatly, unlike fine wine, he has not improved with age. I would probably go see him in a play but as far as musicals go, I don't see how he could be a selling point. His voice quality has none and the delivery seems tenative and frail. The arrangements seem to be meant for a strong singer that would enhance them. The man should stick to talk shows and acting because he has now proved that anyone can sing---but should they?$LABEL$0,0,-100
Quit Bashing Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas. Although this book is predictable, it is still a touching love story which is very well-written.

A thoroughly unscientific self-serving piece of garbage. In the days of the slave trade, slave owners believed that black people were happier living as slaves in the US, than as "savages" in Africa. Budiansky has taken this idea and used it to justify the abuse of animals in factory farms.The idea that pigs or battery hens are happier living in tiny cages, so small that they cannot move, than they would be living in natural surroundings is obscene. The author has simply twisted reality to suit his own selfish needs as an unsuccessful small-scale farmer.This is a book that disgraces its publisher, let alone its author.

Fantastic Book but the CD is a complete waste of Money. I was so impressed with the fourth Edition of the Valuation text (if you don't own it, buy it now) that I went and ordered the accompanying CD-rom thinking that it would have all the basic financial templates outlined in the book. I specifically wanted a valuation model for Banks.Whilst the model on the CD is fine for valuing non-financial companies, I HAD ALREADY DOWNLOADED IT FROM THE NET FOR FREE. Furthermore the CD didn't include a model for valuing banks - I'm going to have to build a new one from scratch.In other words, I've paid a fortune for something I had already got for free. Ironic then, that the model comes from a leading consulting company (McKinsey)...what's the saying about consultants charging a fortune to tell you things you already know (or in my case sell me things I already OWN).$LABEL$0,0,-100

Perks of reading a crappy book. O.K., I bought this book because of all the stellar reviews on this website; (...) This MTV offering is Dawson's Creek in book form ... cliched and exaggerated to the Nth degree.

There's nothing here an average high school student in America can *TRULY* relate to, I'm sorry. (...) There are MUCH better lesser-known books out there that run circles around this slush ...(...)

I purchased this book along with five others when she was first self publishing them.To me I felt like I had entered a history book with our beloved characters added and was sorry that I had purchased them. If you do read them my advice is to make a family tree for you to follow as there is such a lot of intermarrying and you can get lost. (cousins marrying cousins etc)The first book in the series is quite good at first but the rest are terrible and a waste of money in my opinion.She pretends to be Charlotte Collins eldest daughter giving a fly on the wall story for all to read.

This kit was made for beginners to understand the basics. I found the two books to be lacking in subject depth. Many times there would be a statement of fact which I knew meant nothing, but instead of following the statement of inference with the underlying facts the author would just go merrily on his way with the next subject. This collection of two books and a CD was worth about $19.95 instead of the $160 required to find out it's uslessness. If I could get my money back I would and if someone other than the authors immediate family had written in a review I would have never bought this kit.

Book - Practical Wireless Telegraphy E. E. Bucher (1917). In the era this book was written there were NO transistors, tubes were just starting to be used and the only known bands were above the 200 meter band. Most transmissions were in the 600 meter band. "Welding Machines" were transmitters that is a spark with some interesting methods of generating one and tuning circuits were used to more or less (by todays standards mostly less) control the output frequency. The crystal set was king, few if any had the latest and greatest regenerative sets (patent 1914). For the crystal set enthusiast this is a goldmine of ideas and understanding of very early radio.I would reccomend this book to the crystal set enthusiast or anyone with an interest in early radio.

Not very good for sports, eh?In short, I cannot recommend this unit for it's intended purpose of a sports mp3 player.A$LABEL$0,0,-100

Frustrated. My son saved his money up to purchase this trumpet. He currently plays 6 different instruments, he wants to learn as many as he can. He purchased this with the knowledge that it was a "student" type trumpet, not like what we get from a professional store. The trumpet comes, everything looks great, even sounds good when he plays it but the valves are sticking, which is something that happens, hence the need for valve oil. He keeps oiling it and it will continue to stick, bad. Took it to our local music store for advice and they said this was made in China, the parts are not "stock" and we will not work on it and it will be hard to find anyone who will. My son is extremely frustrated because the instrument looks great and sounds great, but he can not play with out stopping to wait for the valve to pop back up! My advice, get one that is not made in china so you can have it fixed if something doesn't work! If we could find someone to fix it, there would be no problems!$LABEL$0,0,-100

RCA only recognizes a 90 day warranty on the refurbished junk it sends you after the original junk dies (or 1 year from original purchase date), so now I'm out of warranty and out of luck. RCA Customer service doesn't seem to care that they sent me two lemons, and is sticking by their policies.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Pathetic Examples and multiple mistakes make this a loser!. What I'd hoped would be an excellent book to introduce me to COM and DCOM has turned out to be an exercise in futility.I've been used to the quality tutorials from WROX press and Microsoft Press where they lead you step by step through an exercise. The author's first example in Chapter 2 I did not even realize was an example until they expected me to run it in chapter 3! There were no instructions on how to create the COM client, just several lines of code. This set the tone of the book.When I tried to run the author's code examples they failed.There were also multitudinous spelling errors and discrepencies between the Figures and the instructions.Though the authors clearly know their subject, I will have to find another book if I wish to learn COM and DCOM. This book is basically worthless as far as the examples go.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Maybe it just wasn't for me.. I totally loved Desert Rose and in response to one of the other reviewers this song was out long before 9/11 bombings, relax. I loved the middle eastern flair that he used in Desert Rose, and I think it opened up a lot of areas of music that have not and should have been explored previously. Now as for the rest of the album, well, it just wasn't for me. It's not bad but to have one song evoke so many sentiments and not have more to go along with it just leads to dissapointment. A thousand years wasn't that bad but I still wish it was more powerful and provocative. I would recommend it to someone who is a Sting fan true and through but if your intrest just got peaked by Desert Rose like mine did than just stick to the Single.$LABEL$0,0,-100

The main theme is LIVING!. This book deals with day to day life problems, with the main point being LIVING! Rather than just another "disease of the week" tragedia, Judy Lynn and her "froup" tell it like it is.If you're looking for high drama, you won't find it here. What you WILL find is a book about how ordinary people, living ordinary lives, make their lives "do-able" in sometimes EXTRAordinary ways.I wish there had been something like this book around when I was seeking answers to my questions back when I was newly diagnosed. It would have saved me a lot of the fear that came from reading some of the misinformation that is still, unfortunately, out there.It's not "gloom and doom", it's not "sweetness and light", it's factual, funny, sad, and presents life with MS in the matter of fact way that this "froup" deals with it all.Thank you Judy-Lynn and online sisters!

Not Worth Your Time. Looking for a way to exercise indoors during the winter months I purchased Sweatin to the Oldies.It was a multiple disc set. The 1st disc was just Richard talking and interviews. The 2nd was moreRichard talking and interviews. By the time we got to a workout I was already not happy. I paid to sweat not listen to testimonials.Richard assumes you know the meaning of the steps he yells out. I didn't. He's got a large group of folks sweatin with him.The camera pans them so often and badly I might add that you can't follow the routine. Not all of them are doing thesame thing and when the camera does go to Richard it's his face/body and nothing of his feet.Very, very poorly instructed and filmed. Don't waste your time or money. I sent mine back. Amazon gladly refunded my money.I found a great way to exercise at home with Leslie Sansone. You get a great cardio/aerobic workout and you can find her online at Exercise TV. Not only do you get a great work out, she's free.$LABEL$0,0,-100
I am satisfied. I first saw the video for "Show me how to live" on MTV about a year ago.I thought the song was excellent but hesitated about getting the cd, eventhough I love RATM. I concidered this album a poor mtv record with only one hit single and didnt want to get swindled in buying it. So, i didn't, I downloaded it. And I must say I'm not sorry. Definetly not sorry. I really think its an excellently played, sung and produced record which has enough trippy, psychedelic guitar sounds by Tom Morello and copyrigted screams by the exSoundgarden frontman Chris Cornell. And they are well put together. I am satisfied.$LABEL$1,0,-100

BOYCOT this product!!. Kinda harsh heading, I know. But I am on my 2nd mouse of this particular design. Great idea! HORRIBLE design! And I think they designed it this way knowing what would happen so as to increase sales.So what happened?? The USB dongle broke both times....it's all in the design. The dongle is essentially 2 peices, and the outer peice pivots (maybe for better communication with the mouse?...nah!!). The problem with the pivoting part is that it goes so far, and then breaks. The wires BREAK internally if you go beyond that point. Did Miscrosoft implement some kind of safety stop on the housing? Of course not!!BOYCOT!!They do make another one that is one peice...I will probably exchange my broken one for this (if I can - it's been a few months).$LABEL$0,0,-100
Pathetic Attempt to Cash In!. I have read both Fit For Life and Living Health, as well as Fitonics. After reaping such benefits from Fit for Life and Living Health I was anxious to learn more from Marilyn. However, I found this book to be devoid of any real diet plan or sound information. It seemed that the authors' should have written a book about meditation instead of healthy eating. I for one am unsure that I can trust a person who waffles between vegetarianism and meat eating all in the same day! I also found it very convenient that the cover of the book proudly declares Marilyn as the Co-Author of the Fit for Life books while inside the book she tears down the very principles she is displaying on her cover, talk about cashing in on the reputation Harvey built! If you are really look for a informative health book try Fit for Life, try ANYTHING else but this!$LABEL$0,0,-100

alfred is awesome. I have Alfreds piano method with I enjoyed so I decided to pick up his guitar method too. I have no complaints about this book. After I played a segment of the danube waltz I knew this is my personal favorite guitar method, and I have a lot of them. There are a lot of different styles presented and explanations on basic skills I see lacking in other books like the Mel Bay series like the different muting techniques. I can't help but go back and play some of the pieces because there's something magical about bach on the electrical guitar. This book is great for beginners and will not suddenly ramp up in difficulty like A Modern Method for Guitar. Highly recommended guitar method.$LABEL$1,0,-100
An insult to all bibliophiles. If you love books and Leroux's novel in paticular do not buy this book. Although the cover art promises great things, alas the illustrations remind one of a Barbie coloring book, only not as sophisticated. The less said of the butchering this line of books commonly does to great novels, the better. A much better read would be the version illustrated by Hilderbrant as the novel in itself shouldn't be beyond most young readers. For the very young try the Bullseye or Step Up chillers. Both are excellent reads.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Open Theism' Roots. I bought this hoping for some good information. Only the first chapter or so is worth reading. His position that God really does not know everything and that if God cannot learn anything would make His life one of stagnation are seriously flawed. I realize that he is quoting others, but they were not worth the space.This book will not help an extreme Calvinist reexamine his position, it will only drive him further into his system. The seeds of open theism are seen in the appendices. Quite frankly I was shocked when I read the book.I hold to an unlimited atonement so I am not giving this book a bad review because of its position, but on how the case is made. I would not waste my money on this one again.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Way Ahead of The Curve. Just finished Angeles Crest and i'm totally dazzled by the author's raging life-force, and depth of experience on so many levels. Mr. Modzelewski is an inspiration to us all, never satisfied with surface appearances, he is constantly taking us to exquisite depths of the human experience, especially in the realm of the spirit, reached via extreme physical tests. This book is way ahead of the curve. Not everyone will "get it" for Mr. Modzelewski goes far beyond normal experience and perceptions that have been dulled & dumbed-down in our superficial culture. The book's magic all comes from his unbounded feelings for Nature, which he expresses like a passionate lover! This is a writer and man of tremendous courage. Bravo and tres bon!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Beautiful couch throw but. This is a beautiful sofa throw but what I didn't like about it was that it only stops at the top of sofa. It's not long enough. It's great with width from arm to arm but not from feet to back. Picture yourself sitting on sofa. The throw starts at your feet, up to the seat where you sit, and goes up behind you, and then stops at the top. Sitting down alot will make that throw fall down behind you. If it was long enough to go over the back and down almost to the floor in the back of couch, I would have kept the sofa throw. They should add another 60 inches.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Stress relief???. I ordered these because I had been reading how ingesting Kava root could produce stress relieving results. The directions say to take one capsule. If you take one capsule, you will probably not notice a damn thing. If you take four to eight of them, you feel something, but I would not call it a "stress relieving feeling." It is more of an irritating feeling if anything; it produces a kind of light-headed/headache-y feeling. In my experience with this product, I would say that it does not produce the intended results. But the same can be said for many herbs. Hell, sometimes even a strong cup of coffee won't wake you up in the morning. Point being, results are going to vary from individual to individual, but if you are really interested in this stuff, I would do a Google search for the website for the company that is based in Hawaii that also makes this stuff. They claim to produce Kava with a much higher percentage of Kavalactones.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Needs Pinyin. If you want your child to learn a few things in Mandarin, this is a fun little video. However, I was hoping to use this as a teaching tool to help me and my daughter learn Mandarin together. But I was very disappointed to find there is absolutely no Pinyin whatsoever and nothing included with the DVD to supplement the lessons.The sound is not so great so you may need a Chinese/English dictionary to make your best guess as to exactly what is being said and which tone is used. The English subtitles are nice to have but simply not enough - plus there is no "word for word" translation anyway.I DO like the content and the way it's presented, but to me it needs more for clarity - especially for such a beautiful and complex language and for those of us who want to get it right.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Excellent Sequel !. Wow, I was amazed when viewing Part 6. This is probably the first of the series with more thrills, humor, and of course... the return of Tommy Jarvis. Part 6: Jason Lives, should have definately been the 5th movie in the series. The movie starts off with Tommy explaining what happened to him when he was a kid (Part 4) and why he is hunting Jason. This is one of the Friday the 13th films in which you actually care about a few of the characters such as the Jarvis family in Part 4. Two other things I liked about Part 6 was Alice Cooper's "Man Behind the Mask" theme song and the fact that Part 6 doesn't refer to Part 5 which is a definate plus. I consider Part 6 a direct sequel to Part 4.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Even though there's not much to character customization, besides changing clothes and armor, and a couple of different hairstyles and facial hair styles to choose between, the quests are fun, and the gameplay itself is very fun, gets a little challenging at times, but whats a video game without challenge. Although it's not necessary to play this one to understand the second, there are some refrences and its overall a very good game.

SHUT UP JAMES!. Someone burned this disk for me along with Rush's VAPOR TRAILS, and I thought VAPOR TRAILS was descent but this album is a piece of genuine CRAP! Jame LaBrie is a horrid singer that just screams his damn head off, and all the songs are quite lengthly and (yawn) boring. The only thing that gets this album even 1 star is Mike Portnoy's awsome drumming (I'm a drummer, you see)! If you want good drumming AND good music, here are the groups I'd recommend:Rush (Neil Peart)The Mars Volta (Jon Theodore)AND OF COURSE...Led Zepplin (John Bonham)$LABEL$0,0,-100
A huge disappointment. This book might have appeal for people who haven't read any other books by Richie Tankersley Cusick, but as someone who has been a big fan ever since Fatal Secrets back in 1992, I was very disappointed by this book. It definitely wasn't up to her usual standards; the entire element of suspense was simply not there. I'm also disappointed by the fact that this author seems to have dropped off the face of the planet so far as her books are concerned, devoting time to writing up screenplays from Buffy the Vampire Slayer instead of writing her own original books. What ever happened to the book which was supposed to come out after Starstruck?$LABEL$0,0,-100
Awful. This is one of my most hated textbooks. The authors assume that you will read the book cover to cover when it should be set up more as a reference text for students.

Good book for runners of all types. I am still reading this book but what I have read so far has been good. In addition to running, I enjoy biking, swimming and working out so some of the aspects of this book as far as weekly milage and the number of running workouts just can't be fit in with the other sports I enjoy. However, I feel this book will help me to be a better and faster runner even if I do have to modify the amount of time and runs recommended.For those who only run; whether a 5k runner or a marathon runner, I think this book has relevant and easy to understand information that will benefit anyone who reads it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Classic Shreds, some issues with this album. I'm shocked to find these on Amazon - it was hard enough to find the Lorries in the 80's in an alt-friendly southern California - did not expect to see MP3s of the older tracks here!Highlights are Monkeys on Juice, Hold Yourself Down, Cut Down.Like another reviewer suggested, these aren't always the best recording quality. The version of "Beating My Head" is absolutely horrible, which is a shame, because the original track had some mad drums/bass syncopation going on. And a note to quality control - the MP3 of "Hold Yourself Down" is another version of "Spinning Round" - and "Regenerate" is actually "Hold Yourself Down". It's actually the same on iTunes, so maybe the publisher messed up.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Avoid - terrible controls. Purchased for my 4yo son.I didn't realize before buying it that it does not have traditional "forward back" + "left right" control sticks. My fault probably, but I missed that.- One stick controls the left side two wheels and the other stick controls the right side two wheels - kind of like a tank.- The sticks are actually on/off only - no variable speed control.- The radio control implementation has some serious reception problems as well, very patchy in whether it works or not, cuts in and out.The combination of the above three characteristics makes it extremely hard to drive for me, never mind my son. Basically a waste of money, he never touches it.It does appear fairly durable, and might be fun outside, but given the control difficulty we didn't even bother.$LABEL$0,0,-100

weak album. like most soundtracks this one is not good as well. (i always regret buying sountracks.) on this album, the beatz are too tacky, and high profile, mainstream rappers put out an weak performance(dmx, luniz, daz, tray d, mo thugs/lazy bone). a disappointment. a few underground acts tried to rip the tracks, but the tunes and beats just couldn't take it there. And vocal/rap arrangements were stupidly produced.(eg: corny choruses, hooks and intros etc.) the saving grace of the album is "Survive" by Snoop dogg and Da Products. probably the only solid cut on this soundtrack. and the highlights of this album was The Lox and Eve with the song"Shotgun Style", and the other "aiight/ok"joints are "Better way" and "Playa Style". out of 19 tracks, not even half the album is listenable. Overrall, to sum it up, a dissapointment and a very lacking album.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A Terrible Idea, Executed Flawlessly. Some music does not translate well. For instance, the triumphant marches of John Phillip Souza do not sound good when played on the harp. And the songs from the soundtrack of Barbra Streisand's Yentl lose a certain something when performed by second-graders equipped with nothing but bones and soup.Yet this sort of infallible logic has been lost on the dunderheads who decided to play the driving rock of U2 on classical string instruments.For the same reason you don't want to hear La Boheme performed by Yngwie Malmsteen and a heard of famished yaks, believe me, you don't want to hear this album.$LABEL$0,0,-100

What a fun book!. All my kids (4,7, & 9 yrs) loved this book! We especially enjoyed the rhyming text. Even so the text was extensive enough to tell a full story. In general, most pages have many lines of text. We read it as a Five in a Row book, but I am sure it will be a requested book for years to come. We were able to talk about many side issues including cakes, yeast, consequences, calories, catapults, castles, alliteration, complementary colors. The duchess decides to make a "lovely, light, luscious, delectable" cake but doesn't accept any advice or follow any instructions. As a result, she puts everything in it and way too much yeast! She sits on it and rises high in the sky unable to get down. It sounds rather silly but it is very well written and was a worthwhile purchase.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Early Avengers with Cathy Gale. This is a six episode set of the British classic. It starts with "The White Elepahnt", an animal we do not get to see and ends with Steed inheriting a race horse in "The Trojan Horse". In between are episodes of double agents and diabolical organizations which are a staple of the Emma Peel years. Still a good taste of Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale. She is finally starting to stand up to the upstart Steed, trying to be a full parter in the dou that is finally given to Ms. Peel.Biggest down side of the DVD is the lack of features.

As soundtracks go, this is a good one.. James Horner is perhaps better known for his "Aliens" and "Star Trek II/III" soundtracks.

It is unfortunate that there are still products out their that are not compatible with SD HC cards because having to be burdened by speed, rather lack of speed, of these SD cards can make one go crazy.

A Dangerous and Misleading Pipedream. This is a sad and dangerous book. The facts based upon research and experience are overwhelming. The only successful treatment for a true alcoholic is total abstinence from alcohol. Barrett offers his readers a false hope that further experimentation at "controlled drinking" will bring different results than in the past. The worst part of offering such false hopes to those in the throes of addiction is that in their desperate state the wishful thinking contained in this tome prolongs their agony and makes a potentially perilous outcome of their situation even more possible. Time and again it has been proven by experience that "rational" recovery is a pipe dream. Carl Jung's theory of the need of a `psychic change' or `spiritual awakening' to break the cycle of addiction still stands and is proven by thousands each year.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A terrible book, strangely unhelpful and oddly organized.. As long time computer user with extensive experience with dBase, I was chagrined and frustrated with my attempts to learn Act!4 quickly with the help of this book. The author seemed to persistently overstate and elaborate on the obvious, while offering minimum assistance in the more opaque areas. Invariably, what I most wanted to know as a new user was either unavailble or relegated to a chapter nearer the book's index than its beginning. The author, annoyingly, saw fit to repeatedly suggest securing professional help in various areas...and even (and I suspect, self-servingly) cited names of pros who the reader could hire.

Enormously clever and quite moving tale of the 20th century and what it means. A photo - literally, of three farmers on their way to a dance, taken by August Sander in 1914 - shows us the last moments before the calamitous 20th century hit western civilization full force, with atrocities and dislocation and the good and evil of the modern world. Richard Powers takes this indelible image and weaves a brilliant three-part tale: of two men looking for answers to what the picture signified, many years later, and then (as a counterpoint) the "real" story of those farmers from long ago. The less you know the better, but anyone interested in the ways the fiction can uncover the truth behind history, or restore humanity to cold facts of the past, should read this remarkable book. This was Powers' first book, years before he achieved fame and (well deserved) accolades, but he was clearly a fully formed genius from the start.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Refused to ship despite exorbitant shipping cost. I order a lobster bake for my parent's anniversary every year. The vendor I normally use closed in the bad economy, so I tried Lobsters Online through Amazon. What a poor experience! I placed my order, putting up with the $44 shipping cost to Hawaii. Days later, I received an email telling me that they couldn't ship to the specified location. Since I do this every year, I know it's not a problem to ship lobsters to Hawaii, and for $44, they can't be taking a loss on the shipping. Nowhere on their page does it say they don't ship to Hawaii - yet they refuse to do so with no explanation.

A Smart Film for Discerning Viewers. This film is not for the squeemish or those with short attention spans and trouble reading English subtitles.

Over-rated. This is a pure melee game. It's unco-ordinated, plotless and the movements/controls are out of date compared to other FPS's. If you're looking for all out shooting, without much teamplay or strategy then try Unreal Tournament.For those looking for a Battlefield 1942/Vietnam type game set in the Star Wars Universe, get set to be dissapointed.Just not very playable or much fun at all once you've seen all the maps and the characters.Get it used!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone- A Great Book. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very good book. It is one of the few books that I will allow myself to read. I started reading it when my mom told me about it, and I'm grateful she suggested it! This book has drama, humor, suspense, and mystery. It is fun to learn about Hogwarts and the wizarding world.

wake up America!. The dilemma of the colonized in search for an identity which is neither static and backward-facing, nor imposed by the worldview of the colonizer is the subject of Erdrich's Love Medicine. Her winding, free-flowing storyline mirrors her endorsement of the fluidity of family connections, one of the most significant difference between Euro-American and Ojibwa cultures. Defying the strictures of the novel, the anthology, or any other established writing style, Erdrich refuses to abide by the rules of Western traditions of fiction. A slap in the face to any notions of the superiority of such traditions, Erdrich's tales demand attention by being undeniably honest, and evoking empathy for even those characters who represent everything which is in opposition to Western culture, and zeroing in on the painful truths of America's imperialist history without subjecting the reader to a history lesson. One of the most important books on the Native American experience I've ever encountered.$LABEL$1,0,-100
If you're looking for real "low carb" this isn't it. The book contains a reasonable number of recipes and lots of 'hints' that if you've done ANY reading about low carbohydrate eating, will be superfluous.The recipes run the gamut of carb counts, though I thought that the bulk of them were much higher carb than is helpful. Following the suggestions in this book and the recipes, it wouldn't be all that hard to hit 80-100++ grams of carb per day... which is simply TOO HIGH for many people who are following low carb lifestyles.Many recipes call for sugar, white flour, semi-sweet chocolate and cornstarch. Come ON... those are NOT "low carb" ingredients.This is more or less a repackaged low fat/lower cal cookbook with "low carb" thrown on the cover to try to generate some market share. My copy is being donated to a charity, it isn't worth the space on the shelf for someone interested in real "low carb" cooking.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Fine if you are over level 180. First on the new graphics... I have not seen them yet as they have not been released.For all new items you must be over at least level 130 to get to the new island, except a few dungeons camped by people macroing.All patchs that have come out since release are aimed toward extream high levels. Or melee. Case in point GW quest last month. No low level could kill a pumpkin lord. The buffer was camped by a level 210 to get the goodies. This month content is all mage resistant if you are under level 150. The one new orb intrduced into the game is buged. The so called event you had to be over level 100 to attend.I have been waiting since release for a answer from their tech support on migrating problems with 2 of my accounts. They offer no support unless you want to make a long distance call.So unless you are a high level melee or very high level mage do not waste your time and money on this. It is not like the old days where they added something for everyone.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Essential. This is essential reading for anyone who owns a dog that guards resources. It could prevent a child from being bitten. It could save your dog's life. The procedures in the book are based on sound theory, and they work. I do not know of any other book on the subject, so it's a good thing that this one gets it right.I adopted two strays that were aggressive resource-guarders. I worked the plan in this book, and now I think they would give up anything. I caught one of my dogs swallowing a "mystery lump" in the living room. I casually opened his jaws and removed it from the back of his throat. No complaints. It turned out to be only a cheese cube that I had dropped when making myself a sandwich. So I gave the dog a third of a weenie, and then I gave him back the cheese. I swear he looked at me like I was crazy, but he was happy with the exchange.It is a very thin book, but all the info you need is there. Buy it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great Coat. This coat is perfect for my use. I work construction and out in the elements everyday - this coat keeps out the cold, wind and rain. If it is very cold out, I will layer a sweat shirt along with my long underwear and t-shirt. The coat being longer than the jacket, the coat keeps my lower back warm.

Whose grandpa shot these things?. I agree with R. Pearson. I realize that real RR fans will probably love to see the equipment and the routes and so on. And I guess they like this set. But I'm just a guy who likes travel documentaries with a certain level of production values. And these DVDs DO NOT have production values. It looks to me like the chamber of commerce got a staffer's grandpa who volunteered to shoot these things on his old gear. They mostly look as bad as VHS tapes. The video is low-rez and jaggy-ridden. The scenery mostly looks dreary, because of the dreadful videography. A lot of stuff is shot through dirty train windows. And so on. The narration is clunky in its scripting, and the voice talent again sounds like a chamber of commerce volunteer. The canned music, ick. Even though I paid just $3 for this thing, I feel like wasted my money. Just an awful, awful set.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Melvins surprise. Most people who have had encounters with the music of Melvins propably pin them down as a sort of a grungy heavy metal sludge. Therefore this album is a true surprise since this is hardly even rock. King Buzzon and co. truely display their melodic abilities here, creating some of the most moodful tunes in the last few years. Especially the first half of the album is excellent, almost haunting. Not for diehard metallers or grungefans, but for anyone willing to hear great, atmospheric music.

Simply cannot relate to her views. I've read the first two chapters. Personally this book doesn't cut it for me. The way she sees the chakra is completely different from what I'm used to (ie: 7 levels) and she attributes different colors to them. That in itself isn't the biggest deal, but her exercises seem to require extremely specific hand positions and such things which personally (from experience) doesn't require such complex coreography.I have no doubt that what she wrote works for her and will work for someone else our there, but to me, this book isn't what I would see as a "good book to learn from". It's more of "this is my way to do it" with a laundry list of what I can do and you can do the same thing.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Dinosaur Paper Chains/A Complete Kit Including 12 Stencils. This book is great for all ages. I bought the book to use with scrapbooking pages, but will also use this as an activity with kids as young as 5 years old. The stencils are large enough that a small kid can use, yet detailed enough to embellish the work that I do. The stencils are easy to cut for a youngster. The paper that is included is elegant for scrapbook pages or for a kid's project. I highly recommend this book for anyone who works with kids and likes to keep them busy. The possibilities are endless. I have seen other 'paper chain' books and they were too complicated for me let alone a kid.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Fell off hard man..... Sorry fellas, but I heard INS on Protect Ya Neck and said he was the dopest in the clan. The guy that comes with lyrics like "I crystalize the rhyme so you can sniff it" was supposed to hit harder than anyone else out there, but for whatever reason this album fell off hard. 17 tracks on the LP and maybe you can peep 3 or 4 fresh beats. The rest of the album sounds like it was put together by some hollywood studio, not the true dungeon sounds that Wu is known for. Had they followed the formula for earlier success, and had RZA realized that his beats with Deck's words is like peanut butter with the jelly, this album would have gone down in history. Instead, it goes down as one of the biggest dissapointments in a long time. It just hurts, man.

Money.. Moran is a well known CIA agent. To know Moran through her work is diametrically opposite to know her through hervideo interviews on the internet, the most important one already being taken down right now. I might as well writea summary of what that interview said: "you can break your mental and physical limits". This is CIA performancepsychology, and according to rumour, Lindsay Moran is a master of it.Now back to the book review. Lindsay Moran has used every trick of the nonfiction writer: composite characters,fictional characters, outright fabrication, excetera, to create a suspenseful work. The most important point shemakes is that the CIA is no place for women, and that is why she left.This is not the case. Lindsay Moran never left the CIA. No one with this many years of seniority has trouble goingon extended paid leave with benefits (to write a book).In conclusion, the best part of the book is Lindsay potraying herself as a dirty girl when in fact she is a dourGerman Protestant.$LABEL$1,0,-100

And you thought Nick was bad.... Aaron's jammin' and Nick's pretty good for a prepubescent boy. How about singin' sistah Leslie? Let's just say that the singing gene doesn't run through the females of the Carter family. The title "Like Wow" doesn't plead to be taken seriously. It's just another sugared-up pop song desperate to go mainstream. Her voice sounds much like her brother, Aaron- only whinier. She sings surprisingly worse than Britney Spears and it is obvious that she is just as digitally manipulated as the Pop Princess. "It's True" was better than "Like Wow," but if you're trying to find meaning in those songs, you won't find it. You won't even come close to understanding them; it might be Leslie's low moans or the lyrics themselves. "It's True" was well produced. The music was addicting.

Overrated and dumb. Everyone I've talked to said Linkin Park was incredible and awesome. I am a huge fan of rap/metal but this is nothing like Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, and Papa Roach. It was terrible.

BUt Linkin Park starts singing rock then coverts so quickly it's annoying (especcially in the song IN THE END) I hated it and if I could have given it 0 stars I would.

Shabby graphics, despicable gameplay. If you enjoy beating up old ladies, if you aspire to be a criminal, if you want to be a jerk or a criminal defense attorney, maybe this game is for you. Sure it's fantasy, but I hated the character, and wanted to play as someone else, namely a cop, so I could give the main character the beat down he deserves. Basically, I wanted to lose. Plus, the graphics are horrible, and stink of the game's PS2 heritage. The guy's legs look like sausages, and the other citizens look like circus freaks.

Appalling.. Excuse me, but wasnt anyone who has read this book as appalled as I was by the fact that the empath-heroine walks herself through the scene of a brutal rape/murder, basically experiencing everything the victim did, and then immediately goes home and has sex with her perfect love interest? Yuck! Until I reached that point, I was genuinely compelled by the book, the choppy writing and the inconsistencies notwithstanding. But that scene was utterly arrogant on Roberts' part. I'm willing to suspend disbelief and lose myself in a romantic fantasy, but it should at least ring A LITTLE BIT true. Am I as a reader supposed to immediately dismiss this perfectly nice girl (who could just as well have been the heroine of another romance) who's been brutally murdered and instead identify with a heroine so callous?

As good as the middle volume gets.. The first game introduced us to the cast of the G.U. series and gave us fans of the original games a lot of enjoyable and awesome tweaks to the mundane battle system that was of the first 4 games of the series. I thoroughly enjoyed how this game plays and with the second volume, it adds several new battle mechanics, plus a few mini games for those continuing the series. This game continues the awesome story line that G.U. vol. 1 Rebirth left off on, and basically brings the player closer to solving the mysteries that the game set out for the gamers and Haseo, the main character, to figure out. The difficulty in this game was cranked up a lot from the previous version, so I've been seeing myself get game overs more often and such and it is exactly what I'm looking for. This game is a must get and everyone who loves RPG's should give the .hack series a try.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Positive look at MS. This is a book that gave me hope shortly after being diagnosed. It is a book I bought a number of copies of to loan to family and friends. It does a good job of telling about MS without being quite so scary as most. It really could use some updating, a lot of advances have been made since it was published.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Easy, fun read. This book is so easy to relate to if you are in your 20's, single, and working at an unchallenging job... and most of your time is spent going out with friends and on dates or at least thinking about those things.

A pleasant new series!. This is a fascinating novel about a part of American history that I don't know very well. Shaker society was never really covered in class, and so I read this with fascination. Besides the well done parts about Shaker society, the mystery itself is also fun to read about. Sister Callahan seems to be the only sane person sometimes there as the other Shakers are portrayed as religious fanatics to the point of being violently fanatical. I'm hoping that the people we meet in the next book will be a tad calmer. Besides that one problem I was still enchanted by this book and look forward to the next one.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Haven't I heard this before?. Crap! Everything about this new effort is crap. Perhaps the chemistry they had on the first album was just a fluke. The musical compositions sound nearly the same as the first album. The beginning riff on "Your time has come" sounds very close to cochise. The lyrics are trite, self absorbed and meandering(kinda like soundgardens last effort). Morello took us down the same ole same ole noise road with his guitar solos. The most annoying quality of this album is the sound, it's flat and lifeless, the mixes are blase, muddy and totally lacking in edge.I don't see anything redeeming about this album. Perhaps they should've stayed in exile awhile longer.$LABEL$0,0,-100
On a mission. I was disappointed with myself that I didn't notice I had purchased the 12th edition (used 1992)but more importantly that this book was initiated as a catalogue for Christian missionaries.

I thought the NT, New Testament, was originally written in Greek.I will keep it as a handy catalogue of languages, but I will look elsewhere for information on the languages of the world.$LABEL$0,0,-100

IT IS ALL HAPPENING AS WE ON THE PLANET PLAN IT. I have just recently discovered the KRYON books though they have been with us for the past ten years. ALL IN ITS RIGHT TIME means it was just right for me to read KRYON now. And I feel so blessed and grateful that the books have fallen off a shelf into my hand in the usual synchronistic manner of how I discover books. I want to SHOUT to everyone I know to read these books and see where we have brought ourselves. Unfortunately, most everyone I know is still waiting for the books to fall off the shelves. But for all of you out there and I know there are at least 144000, run don't walk to your nearest book store for BOOK I and I promise you will immediately get the next six or seven and hope that before KRYON is through there are at least a couple more waiting for us!

Awesome travel router!. I am actually writing this review using the DWL-G730AP access point. It's super tiny and works flawlessly.I've used it a a hotel conference where the conference room had 1 lan port and using this router I managed to securely share that connection with over 20 attendees. Performance was more than acceptable and signal strength, despite it's dimunitive size, is impressive.Overall a well balanced product. My only beef is that I wish they had made the power adapter even smaller, and oh yeah, the thing looks ugly. I wish they made it more stylish looking.But those 2 caveats do not affect the performance of the router in any way, they are just my comments.Go ahead and buy it! You'll be satisfied!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Never received from Amazon. I wouldn't know how this book is. I ordered it December 11 2005 and never received it. Amazon cancelled my order in March because they said they did not receive confirmation from me that there would be a delay. Not only could I show proof I had given the confirmation, I also had an email with an apology saying they would send it to me for free. But because they cancelled my order, we had to start it again.

Pretty Darn Good. I've taught beginners using several "method" books (Mel Bay, Bay and Christianson, Leavitt's Berklee series), and I've currently settled on this one. While I'd prefer not using tablature as a crutch, many students refuse to learn standard notation. Vecchio's book has both, so the motivated student can learn standard notation. Additionally, students respond better to modern material than "Wildwood Flower" or the dreaded "Fourth String Study". The combination of flatpick and fingerstyle is also a nice touch.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The best and the easiest to read English translation.. Dr. Khalifa's translation of the Arabic Quran certainly appears as a translation inspired by God and as claimed by the translator himself. This translation also inspires the reader and clarifies many things right at the first reading. The translation is also claimed to be most accurate and is most definately an easy read. It comes with many facts regarding the miraculaous mathematical coding of the Quran as contained in one of the appendices to this translation. Highly recommended. If you want to know what Quran is all about, then this is the translation to read. Any other translations thus far are no match to this one.$LABEL$1,0,-100
a BEAUTIFUL movie!. Oh, wow. This movie is just so magical. Everything about it is absolutely captivating. I love the the time it's set in, because this allows for a lot of beautiful, old-fashioned backgrounds that accent the perfectly poignant acting! The little girl is so adorable, and there are some scenes in this movie that seem to belong in a painting, they are so visually-appealing and colorful. This movie is one of those movies you can watch and totally immerse yourself in and forget you're watching a movie, actually believing you're IN it. I wish I could give it more than five stars, because it truly deserves it. It really gives you that deep-down, warm feeling that only the best movies can make you feel. It's rare to find such a deeply-moving movie that can be enjoyed by anyone!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Works fine in Israel. I live in Israel. I ordered the unit from Amazon with some fear that it may not work properly here. However the unit is great and it works excellent. You can set up the unit to view your position in Israeli coordinates -new or old. Just look on the internet for the Israel Datum, and enter the data in the Datum screens. The car power-cable is a must, and so is the dispenser. It does not work in house, but I get a good reception in the car (without an antenna). Although this is my first GPS I can tell it is a very good one with many options. When you on the move (for example you drive from one town to another)it draws a line in the map screen, showing your trails. Then when you drive back, it draws parallel lines keeping a clearance between the lanes and showing points of intersections. The unit does not come with any map for Israel. I do not recommend to buy the MapSource as it is not accurate. I give it 4 stars just because I never rate anything as 100%...$LABEL$1,0,-100

Incredible video, not to be missed!. I own a copy of this video and sent one this Christmas to my best friend back home. Oddly enough, we both had Rick Larson as a professor in college, and I distinctly remember him as a favorite then as well. He did a phenomenal job making this video, which is well-researched and awe-inspiring to watch. I can't wait until my kids are old enough to watch and fully understand the content that the "Star of Bethlehem" covers; just a few years to go! Since it is a documentary, you must be prepared for the presentation (no Hollywood antics here!), but I assure you, watching this video is time well-spent. I'd highly recommend it as a Christmas gift to anyone and everyone, but don't wait until then to buy one for yourself!$LABEL$1,0,-100
ONE OF MARGOLIN'S BEST!. I was lucky enough to get an Advanced Readers Copy of this novel, even though I paid a little more money. I just couldn't wait till it was released. Phillip Margolin is one of my favorite courtroom thriller authors. "The Associate" was very interesting. It dealt with Daniel Ames, a lawyer working for a firm in Oregon. He is defending a pharmaceutical company aganist allegations that one of their drugs is the cause to many disfunctions and problems with newborn children. The case picks up steam when a scientist who works for the company gets burned to death. The novel gets more complex from then on, going deeper into the studies of the company and more research. The conclusion is shocking and exciting. This is a must read for courtroom and Margolin fans. Margolin is ten times better than Grisham & Turow!Brad Stonecipher$LABEL$1,0,-100

What I did discover upon the solid recommendation of a sage-in-the-woods is an extraordinary juxtaposition of rhythm and glorious melody and gargantuan beats and a conviction that only 30 years of love could muster.

Solid instructional book. John Jacobs provides a solid instructional book. Many instructors fall into either an arm driven or (more popular) body driven swing. While body driven instructors put Jacobs in the arm driven swing category, I believe he's really exactly in the middle. He believes that both are required in the appropriate measure.A big bonus is his sections on troubleshooting on the course (including how lie, slope and club will affect shot direction and shape) and the fixs/faults section. The fixs/faults section is an abbreviated version of his Golf Doctor book, but just as good and a little more simplified (for the better). Technical swing mechanists will find fault with some of the physics of his explanations, but his fixes are based on years of experience and have worked for me.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A compilation of uptempo Disco and R&B tracks that should not be a part of the "Smooth Grooves" series.. Rhino's "Smooth Grooves" series most definitely took a turn for the worse on this volume. Just what this compilation's producers were thinking of when they decided to include the songs by Dynasty, Kraftwerk, Marvin Gaye, Ashford & Simpson, Kano, The People's Choice and the others that managed to make it onto this CD is beyond me as they are all uptempo Disco hits that got plenty of exposure in the clubs but that most certainly don't belong on a romantic music series. If you are looking for a compilation of late-1970s or early-'80s Disco and Urban R&B you'll probably like this compilation but it should never have been included as part of the "Smooth Grooves" line.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Anne-Victim of Henry's Lust. I was not familiar with this movie (it was released before I was born), but wanted to see it after reading THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL by Philippa Gregory. Gregory portrays Anne as the scheming seducer, but in this movie Anne and her sister Mary are both portrayed as the victims of Henry's lust and the rules of the society in which they live. I am not familiar with Bujold's work, but was impressed with such a young woman meeting Richard Burton on even ground, and even stealing the scene. As for Burton, I found it rather hard to believe him as Henry VIII, especially since the film-makers did not attempt to give him Henry's famous red-gold Tudor hair. It was hard to see him as anything other than "The" Richard Burton. All in all, a good re-telling of the story of Anne and Henry, not just your average costume drama.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Rusty Young, Paul Cotton and Gerorge Gratham are great songwriters and singers.

Disappointing. I felt this movie was terribly disappointing. My issues are:1. She seemed to get freaked out/scared WAY to easily. I was wondering why she would react so terrified to such simple stuff. She knew her dad and uncle were there, so hearing sounds isn't really abnormal.2. They advertised this as in real-time style, but by the end of the movie, you realize that was entirely pointless (SPOILER: there is a twist that makes the real-time aspect completely bogus since what we've been watching isn't what was going on. So what we saw wasn't even the correct unfolding of events).I feel the movie was very cliche with an ending that's been beaten to death. Some may find this scary, but I was just scratching my head wondering why she was so freaked out so quickly. And wondering when I would finally get a good scare. Never happened.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Needs bonus tracks. I became an Elton John fan during the superstar's 1976-82 career lull, A SINGLE MAN (released in '78) among the first of his albums I obtained. The weak lyrics accompany routine music and only three songs stand out: "Big Dipper" and the minor hit singles, "Part-time Love" and "Song For Guy." Both those 45s had great flip-sides, "I Cry At Night" and "Lovesick," respectively, and it is too bad the CD release of A SINGLE MAN did not include them as bonus tracks. The rest of A SINGLE MAN has hints of what made Elton great. It was just a matter of time until he got back in top form with JUMP UP, TOO LOW FOR ZERO and BREAKING HEARTS, to name three of Elton John's worthwhile 1980s albums.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Same story... different setting. A lot of books are about man's struggle, etc. Frankly, it gets a bit boring and "ho-hum" after awhile. The only difference with this novel is the location: Newfoundland.As a Canadian, I have been to Newfoundland and I think the author's depiction is really off base. I believe it gives readers a false impression of what this maritime province is really like.Some characters are annoying and I'm not a huge fan of her narrative voice. I also dislike the excessive use of sentence fragments. This is, of course, personal preference. My opinion of the book is that the use of descriptive detail and imagery and other literary devices conceals the fact that the plot is fairly bland.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A Great Feminist Sci-Fi Novel. I came across the name Octavia Butler when searching for science fiction books written by a black woman with a black woman as the protagonist and I found thos gem! If you are into the concept of humanity destroying itself and having to give up part of itself to survive, this book is for you. This book uses metaphors to discuss complex subjects including the role of women, the role of science and genetic enginering, the contradiction that is humanity and learning how to start over when there is little trace of the past. Dawn is an easy read and will definitely cause you to read Adulthood Rites and Imago. A great book!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Nav300 works okay, but don't buy it. I've been using this GPS for almost two years. It works well enough, but it appears that bankrupt Delphi will not be supplying map updates. I am a road warrior, and I am already running into problems where the maps are not accurate, or roads are missing. Also, it won't save a destination unless you are on a road, so if you are in a parking lot, down a long driveway, etc, you have to go back to the road to save the location.

You get what you pay for!. I purchased this radio to listen to FM stations while I am out locally on foot, and while traveling abroad. I tested it in my back yard. It will not tune in the three strongest FM signals from the closest transmitters. They tune in clearly on the wimpy little radio card that plugs into my old Palm Zire PDA. (That PDA has been superseded by a more powerful one with no over-the-air receiver capabilities.) Instead, the Coby attempts to tune in weaker signals from more distant transmitters that are barely audible even at high volume.Unfortunately, it comes in plastic clamshell packaging that has to be cut open. Because it has been opened, it cannot be returned for a refund. Strictly speaking, it is not defective, so it cannot be returned on those grounds, either.

Holy Cow!I'm an avid music collector, over 1000 discs now, and the first time I listened to this I said "oh yes, this is what I have been waiting for..." I graduated high school in the 80s and loved all the heavy metal that was popular back then. Of course as I've grown into my 30s my musical horizons have been expanded beyond belief, into jazz, ambient, alternative, space music, you name it. The other day I got my hands on this and it's just the ticket. All the technical mastery you could want, but in a band that delights in playing AS A BAND and not just shredding into oblivion like Yngwie. Crossed up with some funk and enough other influences to really keep you captivated. It's great stuff!$LABEL$1,0,-100
A misleading title. If you want a book on philosophy, this is for you. If you are looking for a complete guide to daytrading, you will find this book to be mostly padding. Detail useful to a daytrader forms a surprisingly tiny percentage.Its title is the most misleading I have purchased in some years. I want my money back.$LABEL$0,0,-100
