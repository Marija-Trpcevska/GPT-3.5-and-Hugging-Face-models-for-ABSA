Read 'A Good Man is Hard to Find' to understand this movie. This movie is a grisly fairy-tale, Little Red Riding Hood with all the gory details of the wolf's attacks and his death by axe. The child is the key to the story. The violence is so exaggerated as to be a horrible parody. The line the male killer makes (who has no name by the way) at the end about the little girl is everything. A very dark comic parable. Don't take its over-the-top violence seriously.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Sorry, but it's true. 2 stars. I love the book series, but the movie was disappointing. Now my family thinks the books are boring and that I have a lousy sense of good reading. This was the only thing that I thought could get my husband interested in reading the books, but he slept through most of the movie. I am sorry to all the hard working people.I don't think you should make any movies of the other books . I have read #'S 1-6 and can't wait to get # 7 in soft. Please, if you read this, do not skip the books. THE KIDS books are not as good, but they have different characters and stories. PLEASE USE YOUR MONEY ON THE BOOKS. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT THEM DOWN.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Find a better book. This book is comprehensive, yes, but the explanations are poor. I find his writing style difficult to follow. The book is poorly edited as well, for example, the second chapter introduces datapath logic cells and then immediately goes into a multipage treatise of multiplier architecture. Interesting information but it seems much out of place given the context. The problems are not very helpful either. Often you will need to search for information outside of the text in order to complete the question. The author obviously knows the subject well, I just don't think he does a very good job of teaching it.$LABEL$0,0,-100
vastly disappointed.

Shrill propaganda for software anarchists. Useful, but not terribly original, content undermined by smug self-congratulating boosterism.

"Only for cult followers...". The whole time you follow Harvey getting drugs, using drugs, placing bets, and doing other bad things while on duty. It's tedious and painful to watch; I can only give it points for its "right there," documentary-style camera-work and Harvey's effort in portraying the character.

An adamantly recommended acquisition. In Rules Of Civility For The 21st Century, Henry Wheelwright has assembled a compendium of two hundred rules of civility drawn from submission by some four million Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts across the country. The rules of conduct were sent in by boys for themselves and others after reflecting on the rules that President George Washington copied out for himself as a youth of 14. Also provided for the reader is a Civility Workshop addressing modern threats to civility and keys to character building and leadership.

Heartbreaking and lovely.... I first encountered Amy Bloom's keen insight and matter-of-fact humanity in the pages of New Woman magazine, where she writes a monthly advice column called "Sex/Life."

What a messed up excuse for a film!. I was so incredibly disappointed by this film.The acting was wooden (and that's insulting to trees), the filming was amateurish, the plot was paper thin - I guessed who it was three minutes into the film, and forced myself to watch the rest of it because I had paid for it.Admittedly the only real sex scene was mildly hot, but no more than you see on normal television. This was lame with a capital L.Wish I had saved my money and would tell anyone thinking of buying it to rent it if you must, but don't put any hard earned cash into buying it.Going to the back of my DVD shelf to gather dust until I get round to selling it.Big thumbs down.$LABEL$0,0,-100
The Borowsky Family's Musical Favorites of All Times. Musical Favorites of All Times, the Borowsky family's genre spanning arrangement of classical music, is a collection of long cherished and well-known pieces, all played with a clarity and skillful sound unique to the Borowsky family of musicians. This collection has clearly been put together with hard work, and dedication, not to mention skill, as the pieces within represent some of the most accurate, soulful, and standard breaking playing of our time.As best exemplified by the performance of David Popper's Gavotte, and Ernest Bloch's Nigun, the Borowsky family plays with authority, commanding the ear, leading the listener into the swirling emotion of the piece being played.Five stars out of five for an impressive collection and a wonderful listening experience that defines the epitome of what the classical musician should be.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Please don't ever make me watch this thing again!!. This movie was not very true to the book. The man in the yellow suit didn't wear a yellow suit, Winnie had a turtle, not a frog. . etc. It was pretty well made, but if you are a great fan of the book you might not like it. The new version made in 2002 is a little more accurate to the book, so you might try that as an alternate to this. The story of this movie is pretty good though, because the book was a very good book. People who remember this movie from their childhood might like this, though.

Beware the purple prose. I generally like most fantasy books at least a little bit, but this one left me wondering if an editor had ever seen the manuscript.

BIG disappointment. I was extremely disappointed in my 2mm 24" snake chain. I have bought several pieces in the past from Silver Insanity, but it seems they've decided to cut corners.

Breakout Thriller. This is a great book. I've enjoyed the others in the series, but MOTION TO DISMISS, takes Kali to a new level. The plot is intriguing and the pacing suspenseful, but what makes this book stand out in my mind are the characters. All of the main characters are flawed and complex human beings. They are very real and believably unpredictable. There are lots of weighty issues to ponder here, but they never get in the way of the story. This is an author to watch.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Time passed this. 2 1/2A perfectly mediocre live capsule from this minor folk-proggie does capture a few instrumental moments of passion (the second half of Year of the Cat and some creative liberties with the following Pink Panther theme finally breathe much needed life into the disc), but the majority of singer-songwriter-slush feels autopiloted-bland at best, worse off for that pretentious late 70's British sort of lyrical and vocal delivery.

GREAT "How-To" Guide for Communications Professionals. This book is a clear, concise read on handling the media during a crisis - and how to come out a winner. At just under 200 pages, it's packed with more useful info than a book 3x its size.The one thing that really stands out is Hoffman's clear understanding in all communications - know who your audience is and speak directly to them - no matter what the medium.

Nice product.. This vacuum sucks! I mean that in a good way. It has excellent suction. Does a great job on carpets! I would give it 5 stars, except that: 1. It's a bit on the heavy side; 2. the electrical cord isn't designed to retract; and 3. the switch on the vacuum that turns on and off the rotating brush for when you go from carpet to bare floor (and vice versa) doesn't seem to work. It keeps springing back to "ON" position, and doesn't click to stay "OFF." I considered returning it, but when I checked the floor models at local stores I noticed that they didn't work either. I thought I knew how to flip a switch, but perhaps I'm suffering some sort of skill deficiency here. There must be some trick to it that I haven't figured out yet. I will be checking courses at my local Community College for switch flipping, and keep you posted if I find any.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Scandle, sex, and fun. I never really was all that interested in the whole Henry VIII thing but I was given this book and just started reading the first couple of pages. It really has a way of engaging you from the start. In the beginning Mary is only a little girl involved in this larger than life role she has to play. You follow her along with her exciting life, and just when things start to cool off for her, you become fixed on her sister. I loved reading how nasty the author made her. I know there are legends of how Ann really was a royal pain. The author did a good job playing it up. It really is quite long over 650 pages, but you wouldn't know it, I read it in 6 days. Its really a page turner. It really only portrays Ann, and Mary in depth, and I liked that. I also liked how the author depicts an aging, baby of a king who likes to get his own way. In the end the author does an amazing job wrapping up the looses ends to the already known facts making this history/fiction story a great read.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A masterpiece. Of course he never wrote an autobiography, but if he told it to cronies, it would sound like this, then he'd have them shot. So imagine Stalin telling his life story, a crude thug boasting of his power, telling little anecdotes about exterminating millions, and sharing his innermost "thoughts". It's black humor at its best. Lourie is a sovietologist and literary translator from Russian, he's done the research, spent time in Russia, he knows his stuff. It's hard to imagine a more accurate portrait of the monster, and once you start reading, you can't put it down. Should be required reading, lest we forget. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A poignant tale of a young Irish-American Boy .. This book by Dennis Smith is a fine prequel to his Engine Co. 82. In 82 we saw a young man dealing with the job he has chosen for himself, and a difficult job that was. In Song for Mary we see the boy who became that man. The only way a man could become a fireman is if he had great compassion for humanity. Mary, his mother, gave him this compassion. The "Song" of the title resonates throughout the book with the haunting refrain of The Rose of Tralee. I thought this memoir was as good, if not better, than those of Frank McCourt and others which have filled the bookshops recently. A MUST-READ for anyone who cherishes their Irish-American heritage or if they came of age in New York City,$LABEL$1,0,-100

Decent--Could be Much Better. I have read several Koontz novels. It seems like we are beginning to see patterns from previous novels(i.e. dogs, TICKTOCK(actually another book), supernatural, warped personalities).

Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when you really need it?. Extremely awful Keanu Reeves stinker that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades. Keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that. Only his co-stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare but not even their great performances can salvage this disaster.

No frills at THE BASE. THE BASE is an overall average film. Clearly the actors' talents are not put to full use. Mark Dacascos' excellent martial arts skills are supressed to appear like a good street fighter, not the impressive military weapon he is suppose to portray. The story line is interesting, but is weakened by the poor ending of this action film. The good guy wins, but it is a dismal victory. The nudity added to The Base does not really flow with the story line. The director clearly failed in this film. The acting in this film is very good, but the camera angles were not. I'm sure the actors were disappointed with the final product. THE BASE is worth seeing once. I suggest renting versus buying.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Thorough treatment. Levy presents a well-articulated, easily read treatment of the Tabernacle of Moses, its furnishings, utensils, services and priestly clothing and functions. A great book to read to see how God was foreshadowing His Son, Jesus, well before His incarnation. Levy clearly ties together Old Testament practices & theology, which we often ignore, and New Testament beliefs. I would recommend this to anyone interested in understanding: (a) more about the Tabernacle itself, (b) a deeper insight into Jewish practices and their foundations, (c) a fuller and richer understanding of God's plan of redemption and atonement, sanctification and regeneration, worship and communication with God.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Warranty Extension. Just got the watch and it seems to be working great. I have adjusted the date and time base on the mechanical instructions given. The watch has performed well for the 1st week.I got several compliments on the watch.Only suggestion to Stuhrling is they need to make the emblem in the middle of the watch a decal rather than a stamped letter. Could have made the watch even more impressive.I hope to get several years of use.Warranty card they send you gives an extra year extension if you fill out the review. Not sure how they track it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Coding mistakes and more. It's heavy on VB.Net, which I didn't expect, based on the title and the year released. What bothers me most is the mistakes in their code. For example, they have you define tables in an Access database, and then, in code, they use different table names. That's just the beginning. The structure of the written code is bizarre; indents are random and meaningless. They don't use good programming practices, either, such as using a with/end with struture instead of typing the same variable name over and over...I don't believe the source code for the book ever was published by "Premier Press" (don't be fooled by a name).$LABEL$0,0,-100

Good for some, not others.... There are two different types of Madden player. Some go for accurate simulation and detail, others go for creativity and solid presentation. If your likings fall under the latter of the two, prepare to be bitterly disappointed.Sure, it is true that the gameplay is amazing. Player likenesses are unmistakeable and the action is great. However, those of us who want more from their Madden find this game to be empty and gutless. There is no Create-a-team, create a stadium, or create a fan feature that has been such a great part of the recent current-gen Madden games. The 'create player' function is a joke, and franchise mode has VERY little to offer. You can find all of these features by picking up the game for 10 or 20 dollars less on the PS2, XBOX, or Gamecube. 360 fans deserve better.$LABEL$0,0,-100

The perfect antidote to Outliers. The perfect antidote to Outliers, this book demonstrates the unavoidable pitfalls to attempting the lifestyle espoused by Outliers. It is possible to be successful AND happy, but not unless you make happiness a goal that you manage as vigorously as you manage success. This is written by a psychologist for the stars, and is filled with both easy to remember anecdotal stories and sound principals which I have observed in the people I consider fabulously successful and yet still completely grounded and approachable.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Does as stated. This stove can come in really handy even without a power outage. Used it to cook brunch for a crowd.

Waste of time.. This book was poorly written, and presented most of its subjects in a cursory, unintuitive manner. The treatment of the technical subjects amounted to little more than a bulleted list of formulae.

Typical V-Tech, BROKEN!. We've been burned by V-Tech and their inferior products twice before. The V-Smile system only worked for a few months; the V-Pocket worked for exactly 13 days. So, I suppose this is pretty much our fault for buying our 7 year old what he REALLY wanted for his birthday.Imagine my complete lack of surprise when I pulled this system out of the box on his birthday and it didn't work at all. We've tried all of the "Troubleshooting Tips" three times and tried various outlets in the house. The thing does not work. When we called V-Tech about the issue, we were told that since we bought the unit 3.5 months ago (when it was on a great sale), it is not their problem.

Discover this Band. Fastway just couldn't break into the upper tier of metal acts in the 1980's and I'm not sure why? Give this disk a listen, and you'll see that the band had a knack for writing great rock music. Tunes like "All I Need is Your Love" and "Feel Me, Touch Me" are instantly catchy, and stay with you long after the disk is over. Fast Eddie's guitar work is fantastic! Check out that cool riff on "Say What You Will", that song should have been a staple on metal radio. The song "Heft" is great. It's an odd little tune with a killer bass and drum combo. If Pete Way was playing bass on this disk, then he is responsible for two of my favorite undiscovered bands "Fastway" and "Waysted", and "Heft" may be one of the coolest tunes from the era. You can't go wrong picking up this disk for under $10.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A very neurologically biased book! Not recommended.. This book is basically a book written to bring more business to neurologists. Written by two neurologists who state ADD is best treated by neurologists and with medications. Their bias gets in the way of this book being useful. In the real world, try to find a neurologist who will take on ADD patients! Psychologists and psychiatrists are much better trained and equiped, AND available to treat this disorder.

Pass this one by.. I bought this keyboard to replace a malfunctioning Gearhead keyboard. But I started having problems right out of the box. Keys did not function. The mouse has to be within 3 feet of the receiver AND the infrared dot has to be pointed at the receiver. The feel of the keyboard (shape of the keys and curve of the board was very good. However the plastic is very rough and cheap, almost feeling like it's recycled. I don't think it will survive being dropped even once. I find it interesting that the keyboard signal is RF but the mouse is infrared (and therefore line-of-sight only). Why 2 different systems??No more cheap keyboards for me.

Release the UNCUT episodes!. Count me among the people who will not be adding this DVD set to my collection. I have been anticipating the release of the "Roseanne" DVD sets for years, but after realizing that they're being offered using the edited-for-syndication version of each episode, I have no interest. While I understand the reasoning behind cropping them up to air in syndication, there's no excuse to release a full season collection using anything but the uncut episodes.It's ironic that Roseanne waged very public battles for control of the show that bore her name, but has no authority (or, at least, objections) over its being released in this truncated form.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Disappointing quality. I really liked these headphones when I first got them but the "relationship" went down hill oh so very quickly. Within two months of receipt, the on-off slide switch broke off. A few months later the plug developed an intermittent break. Twist the cord just right and you had stereo otherwise only one headphone would work. It finally got so bad that I have put it back into its case and stopped using them. Disappointing for a pair of $100 headphones.

Do you love phrases like sequestered ironic eyes and obtusively abstract posturing? This book is for you. The story beneath the tidal wave of verbosity is marginally interesting.

All sheet, no ghost.... This lavish-looking French production, while it does provide simmering atmosphere by the kettle-full, falls well short in the story department, substituting fill-in-the-blank visual cliche (treading heavily on del Toro's turf in particular) for narrative/dramatic cohesion at nearly every turn. Dialogue and acting are also subpar. It reminded me, as such, of Anthony Hickox's 2010 'Knife Edge,' another attractive but creatively malnourished Euro-natural potboiler. Sumptuous photography and creepy setting distinguish what otherwise might pass for a long, mildly intriguing video-game demo. 2-plus stars.$LABEL$0,0,-100

But the stories within the stories, as told to the mean American who threatens to destroy the photo collection are the real jewels.

Solid book on Java networking. The book covers numerous topics. For background material, it covers TCP/IP theory, security, threading, exceptions, and streams. In the actual networking part of the book, it covers client-side and server-side networking, URLs, datagrams, multicasting, RMI, CORBA, Servlets, and Message Streams. In other words, there is a wide range of topics covered.The book is full of actual code examples. I especially enjoyed one like the finger client and the dns client. These are real world examples that will be extremely useful if I ever need to implement these protocols using Java.One error that I noticed was that it mentioned that the source code from the book was available from two web sites. In reality, at the present time, it is only available from the first one mentioned.Overall, it is a book that is worth owning and has the broadest coverage of any of the Java networking books on the market.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Oshima-san, konnichi wa!. I bought this video just to see Tokyo beauty OSHIMA HIROMI (in Japan, surnames come first, but she's "Hiromi Oshima" to "Hakujin"), and she doesn't disappoint me in it. I studied Japanese at San Francisco City College, and I've dated several girls from Japan. In the video, I also like to see Pilar Lastra who is second to Oshima-san in sexiness to me. Nicole Whitehead is sexy too, but her scenes aren't as good as some of the other girls. Coleen Marie is rather sexy with good scenes. Tailor James and Stephanie Glasson aren't bad, but they fall far behind Hiromi and Pilar in my book. I never watch any of the other girls besides Hiromi, Pilar, Nicole, Coleen, Tailor and Stephanie.

Very Disappointing. I'm a big fan of Card and picked this up only on that basis. The dust jacket blurb didn't sound promising but, hey, its Orson Scott Card. Well, very disappointed is what I am. The character dialog was not believable and the opening set-up wasn't making much sense. But I thought it really started going south when the mechanical soldiers showed up in New York and Our Heroes just happened to be there! The Liberal-Conservative conflict at the base of this story was hard for me to resolve in the beginning. Not because Card wasn't beating me over the head with it but because I kept thinking there has to be more to this story. It was an easy read so I kept at it. The afterword says Card wrote this as the setting of a video game. Well, I guess it was plotted like a video game. I don't really know anything about Card's politics. He comes across as a right wing nut case in the afterward which explains the right wing nut case conspiracy theory of the book.$LABEL$0,0,-100

One time it locked-up and wouldn't even shut off without removing the battery.I have had no problems with the push-to-talk feature.My husband has this same phone and has no problems, so it's entirely possible I have a lemon of a phone.I would never recommend this phone to anyone.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Bad luck maybe. Maybe its just bad luck but I had two of these usb drives and both failed in some way. The first one I had I was unable to delete or add any new data. So I returned it and got another one. After a month of use the drive would only function at 1.1 usb speeds. I tried it in different computers but still the same problem. So I'm done with this drive and will move onto a different brand.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Romance without smut. I loved this book. A woman is in a car crash and thinks she is going go die. She promises to "do good" if she is allowed to live. You then get to see how she goes from a self-centered, rich person to a truely caring, helpful one, and all the bumps that go along with it. Her family thinks she is losing it (her mind) because they don't understand why she is changing. The people at the country club don't understand. It's a very enjoyable book. There is romance in it, but the sex scenes are not explicet, which I truely enjoy. It is nice to read a book that doesn't go into detail with the bedroom scenes and leaves something for your imagination.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disgusting, Distortive, Biased Propaganda. Ms. Bikel makes absolutely no effort to present the facts of the cases she examines in a balanced, accurate, and truthful manner. She deliberately suffuses her work with falsehoods and questionable statements recited as fact, and presents every contention made by her convicted subjects as the gospel (or better, perhaps, "her gospel," from which she preaches quite broadly). The fact that police reports, investigative proceeds, eyewitness accounts, collateral witness statements, and court transcripts contradict these contentions seems to be of no issue to her. While it may be legitimate to debate the appropriateness of life sentences without the possibility of parole being given to young murderers, this documentary contributes nothing of value to that debate. A pronounced and self-proclaimed ideologue, Ms. Bikel brings her brand of blind, fact-averse advocacy to a topic that is actually much better treated without it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

No wonder this has been discountined. I'm a creature of habit, so I kept buying this specific earpiece for my cell phone, since I liked the way it was designed. Small, simple, and I didn't have to look like someone from "Star Trek" with that dumb thing blinking in my ear. It works well, and has excellent sound quality both for my voice and the earpiece. What I liked is there is this rubber "hook" that keeps it in your ear, and is very comfortable. However, every one I've bought (and I've bought a lot of them) has the same problem which is the "hook" breaks off no matter how gentle you are with it. So then you have to sort of stick the earpiece in your ear, and hope for the best. For a while they were very cheap so it wasn't that bad, but now they are hard to find. Soon they will all be gone, and I'll have to find something else. So should you.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A Familiar Overview of The Middle Ages. This book provides an approachable overview in story-telling narrative form of the re-birth of the quest for reason during the Middle Ages of European history. It offers very little which is not already known by anyone familiar with the period or the history of the Roman Catholic Church and its grip on the intellectual development of the European culture at that time. By all means read it if you want a good overview of this strange time, but keep in mind that it is an overview and at the 30,000 foot level.One complaint I must register here is the choice of title. There is very little here about Aristotle or his writings, or his thought. if you are interested in that seek the "Cambridge Companion to Aristotle."$LABEL$0,0,-100
Quality less than expected. I was disappointed in this product. True, it is advertised as "lightweight," but I was stunned to see how little down it actually holds. Most of the baffle boxes had so little down in them, you could easily see daylight through the comforter when held in the air. On the "warmth scale" printed on the package, this one rates 2 out of 7. Wish they'd have added that critical information to the product description.$LABEL$0,0,-100

these batteries are worthless. I thought it would be possible to get a quality replacement battery for a low price.I. Was. Wrong.About two months after buying them they no longer hold a charge. Phone shows battery fully charged, dial a number and press talk, phone goes dead and blank. I know how to maximize battery life, so I'm sure it wasn't me. I bought two as I have 2 phones that these fit, both stopped working. Unfortunately it was past the return date, so I recycled them and bought oem batteries, which are going strong 18 months later. Maybe someone makes decent cheap replacements, but it sure isn't these people.$LABEL$0,0,-100
AVOID - AWFUL ITEM!!! Comes apart and dog swallows!. There are so many problems with this item it is difficult to know where to begin but to warn other potential buyers I'll go down the list of why you should avoid this item.The knobby spikes for teeth cleaning are sharp and caused my dogs gums/tongue to bleed!It is slighly flavored - and the dog loved that - but it encourages chewing on a product that comes apart in big chunks that my dog swallowed before I could get him to spit it out. It's chewy and flavored but breaks off easily which brings the final point...It lasted all of maybe 30 minutes. At the end of that time period my dog had bleedig gums and tongue (I stopped playing with him immediately) and while my back was turned, grabbed the tug toy off the table to chew which immediately resulted in a big chunk coming off in his mouth that he promptly swallowed. Hopefully he will be okay but now we are left "keeping an eye" for things to "pass".Save a trip to the vet and avoid this awful product!$LABEL$0,0,-100
1530 - new and improved model is definitely not an improvement. Well, here it is, July 2005, and I have the 1530 model. I also bought it from HSN. It also lasted 5-6 months. Of course the warranty is for only 3 months. Pure junk. I will never buy a Cyberhome product again. I wish I could take back the compliments I gave about it the first 2 months that I had it. It worked great in the beginning, then I experienced all the problems that everyone here has mentioned. I have noticed that many stores no longer carry this model. Maybe there were just too many complaints.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Didn't work for me. I bought this pan because my cat squats right inside the door to her regular covered litter pan, hangs her bottom over the edge, and pees on the floor. I bought a pan with a high side but she still can't keep everything inside. I hoped the Clevercat design would prevent spillover, but Ginger just bypassed the middle step and peed directly on the floor when confronted with this product. I tried it both with the top off and on, and it didn't seem to make any difference. It looked like a good idea, it just didn't work with my cat. FWIW, she's sixteen years old - a younger cat might take to it more readily.$LABEL$0,0,-100
No real plot. I loved all the books in the A. Blake series until this one. The other reviews that gave low ratings have already explained the problems with this novel and I don't need to repeat it. I tried two times to read this book and managed to read half only. It is so bad with no plot and the usually charming characters (Anita, Jean-Claude, Richard) have turned into perverted psychopaths, completely unlikable. I wish I never started this book and only kept the earlier as a pleasant memory. I wont even look at any more books from this author.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Disappointed. This is not Wolinsky's best effort.First, it needs serious editing.Second, this is just a re-packaging of the current pop psychology thinking. Wolinsky adds to the confusion by adding another component. Instead of YOU acting out on unconscious urges, Wolinsky introduces 'Inner Child' and 'Hypnosis'... so NOW the Inner Child HYPNOTIZES you into acting out on unconscious urges.What's his answer? The same as the old psycho-analytic approach: awareness. When you can become CONSCIOUSLY aware of the processes and the relationships then *poof* they are resolved!I was disappointed that this "Quantum Psychology" expert put so little thought or effort into this book. If you have any education in the area of psychology, this is a waste of your time.$LABEL$0,0,-100
This book has been around for awhile but it still applies today. The copyright of this book is 1985. I wasn't sure how it would apply to today's living. I am 51 and bought the book because someone told me about it. I wasn't sure that I was a woman who "loved too much" but wanted to see for myself. This book is an eye opener. I see how I live every day as a woman who loves too much and how I am making myself unhappy every day. I love the book but it hurts a little to see what I'm doing to myself.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Nice little whistling kettle. This whistling tea kettle heats enough water to make two 12-oz cups of tea, hot cocoa, etc. The whistle starts as a cute little chirping sound as the water begins to create steam, then progresses to a rather loud, sharp whistling that you just can't ignore. The easy-fill opening is very nice, too. Don't overfill, though, because you'll end up with a hot, wet mess on your stove top.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Protracted and Expensive. This is the first of six kits, each equally priced. I found the method to be fraught with language cues that were too syrupy to swallow ("popping above the line", "solution sandwich", "lifestyle surgery", and "tender morsels"). Doing cycles are at the heart of the program, a process that, for me, lent itself more to manufacturing emotion vs. excavating damaging shadow beliefs. I ended up dropping out, and feeling much better for it.I'd recommend saving your money on this one. Try Martha Beck's Joy Diet instead.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Expensive fan in a box. The product description does not make it clear, but this device is not a digital sound generator. It's just a fan in a box with two power settings (high and very high) and some bevels that you can adjust. The two settings are very similar, and for many people this will mean that the lowest setting will not be quiet enough, or the highest setting will not be loud enough. This is a lot of money to pay for a fan in a box, and I wish I could get my money back. I recommend the Sharper Image sound generator, instead. It has a volume knob as well as options for selecting different types of background noise.$LABEL$0,0,-100

just great music. This is a fantastic soundtrack -- there's not a miss on it. It's paced to keep you rolling along with the overall feel of the CD and independent of it being a soundtrack it has a great history of music on it. I'll Fly Away is done wonderfullly, and every song fits well within the collection. This isn't country music. It's evocative blues /roots/ gospel.From the liner notes: The reason for our using so much of the era's music in the movie was simple," explains Ethan Coen. "We have always liked it. The mountain music, the delta blues, gospel, the chain-gang chants, would later evolve into bluegrass, commercial country music and rock n' roll. But it is compelling music in its own right, harking back to a time when music was a part of everyday life and not something performed by celebrities. That folk aspect of the music both accounts for its vitality and makes it fold naturally into our story without feeling forced or theatrical."$LABEL$1,0,-100

Hardly a book to interest a person who thinks for himself.. When we talk about Kirby Godsey, let's be honest. The author has a long way to go to reach someone who has thought beyond the preachments of Southern Baptists and others. I suppose some case could be made for this work to be compared with Tillich's "The Shaking of the Foundations," which didn't shake any foundations to my knowledge, though some found it interesting. Another book from the past comes to mind, "Your God is too small." I guess I just don't feel the need of anyone else telling me what God is really like or what the Bible really means or what should be going on in the churches. The rampant confusion on matters religious is well beyond the ability of Dr. Godsey to say anything of any real importance. Godsey's own denomination is one of the better examples of the confusion of which I speak.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Decent for removing upper lip/chin hair. I guess I'm going against the crowd and have to say I like this product quite a bit. It's not perfect but it helps me take off most of the hair on my upper lip and the soft hair on my chin.The only bad thing about that is, if you leave the cream on for more than 8 minutes, it tends to sting for an hour or two after wiping off the cream. So if the hair comes off around 6 minutes, please happily do so!Tip: BE SURE TO USE WARM MOIST PAPER TOWEL. It'll help with removing the hair. :)$LABEL$1,0,-100
