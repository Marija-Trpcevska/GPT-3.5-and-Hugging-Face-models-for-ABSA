This book was very interesting.. This book although it started out slow was one I would recommend to other readers. It tells the life in detail of a young girl who became a woman before her time.

Holland 1990. To the extent that a Nomeansno show was exactly like a spiritual revelation, this cd is the resurrection and the life.While everything about Wrong is right, some of these songs, especially What Slayde Says and Victory, are about the finest versions of these songs I am familiar with. They distort and mess with your expectations. The vocals are totally clear. I gets to shakin'.When I put this on tonite, I had just forgotten how good it was. It's like a perfect Nomeansno show, and I ain't apologizing for it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Regression. I wasn't sure how this cd would work. I bought it with my fingers crossed that it would. I live in a place where therapists don't offer this sort of thing. So, it was my last resort. I've tried it 2 times now and both times, it worked! My body was put into deep relaxation...not sure my body has ever been so relaxed!One thing that many don't understand about Past-Life Regressions is that you see past lives and you see the death. It can be a very educational thing for us as long as we don't view this instance as a part of our current life. There is separation there and it needs to be there. If you see yourself in a way that is painful to watch, it's okay. Learn from it. Move on. There's no reason to claim any of the emotions or instances as your own now.Past-Life Regressions can help us recognize those parts of us that we don't quite understand. Relationships, hobbies, little quirks, habits etc.$LABEL$1,0,-100
If you like suspense movies, you are going to love this one.. This is the best movie I have ever seen. Even though everyone dies at the end, I still get a sense that those guys are still running around the woods looking for the Blair Witch.

Bonsai Buy!. The book was an old book and I bought it from the Salvation Army via amazon.com.

Didn't work for me.. This book had a lot of good ideas. They simply did not work for me. My son did not want to sleep unless he was being held. I ended up doing a modified Ferber: we let him cry for one minute at a time.

Two Minutes Silence is the ONLY good track on this album (should have been released as a single). And indeed, it provides a welcome relief for weary listeners struggling their way through this horrendous monument to artistic vanity and pretentiousness. I cannot imagine there are many who've honestly listened to this pseudo-art more than once all the way through. The only role this album plays in music history is to serve, like the Wedding Album, as a dire warning to all of how awful the results can be when artistic pretentiousness prevails over good judgement and true creativity. I'd gladly listen to an album's worth of 'Two minutes Silence' rather than just two more minutes of this nauseating tripe.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great quality book. I agree with Suzanne's review of this book. I also purchased this for my son, and he really enjoys it. Really, really well made with very thick pages. Multiple textures and colorful illustrations. My only complaint would be that the text is a bit boring... "this big truck has a shiny red door"... "and this big truck has bumpy wheels".. (etc) Otherwise, I would give it 5 stars.Really good value for the price though.*** Other REALLY good touchy feely books are "Dinosaurs" and "Mermaids".

Fairly superficial. If you are looking for an overview of the causes of infertility, or are newly diagnosed with infertility, this might be a useful book. If you are an infertility patient you probably already know most of what is in it - for example it covers the testing that is done to determine causes of infertility.If you are looking for a really good explanation of how your body works, and how you can maximize your chances of getting pregnant, get Toni Weschler's "Taking Charge of Your Fertility". It's much more thorough and complete description of how you can increase your chances of getting pregnant.The section on mind/body is really stress reduction techniques, which are available in many other places. Infertility causes stress, and stress aggravates infertility, so stress reduction and coping strategies matter. However, buying a book on meditation will give you a much better introduction into how to use and apply the techniques described here.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Amazing, simply amazing.. I heard a large sum of reviews claiming the picture quality was quite low for this box set's episodes. And after so many claims, i waited a month until i bought the blu ray, hoping it would be fixed. I have watched every episode in awe, the picture quality is absolutely perfect. I think that its safe to buy this blu ray now, since funimation must've fixed whatever was producing the low quality episodes before. Not only are the episodes amazing quality, the font of the subtitles has a fresh new feel, that for some reason, makes reading them feel a lot more in touch with the episode. (I guess you have to see it yourself to get what I mean)The boxing case is just incredible,the holographic cover is the biz!

What a disppointment. I was thrilled when they came out with "Ride Again". It was the Aces from the old days. And "Out Of The Blue" gave us some good new material. But this one was a real disappointment. I should have guess by the title that it was a live album - recorded in concert, and it sounds like it. Not only does the music sound dead, and sometimes muffled, but the group sounds tired. I was way excited about hearing some of my old favorites in CD quality, but no such luck.

Reliability Problems. My AVR 347 was wonderful at first, but shortly after the warranty expired, it start to fail. It would occasionally flash "Protect" on the front panel then shutdown. Originally, the receiver would do this every few hours, but now, it won't stay on for more than a couple of minutes. I sent it in for repair, but after spending $100 at an authorized HK service center, it still has the same problem.

A good movie based on a good book. Everyone in my family read the Da Vinci Code and enjoyed it. A movie - well maybe. So often good books just don't make the transition to good books. This was the wonderful exception. The casting was well done - some well-known stars and some new faces. The locations were perfect. Again, some familiar tourist sites and some really great new places.The extras on the DVD were really neat. I especially like the short about Dan Brown and the director getting together to put cryptic items in several scenes to act as pointers to what was really going on. I had missed most of them, but that just gives me another excuse to go back and watch it again.Hope everyone else enjoys this movie.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Ponderous, plodding, weighty. As a former employee of Bank of America, NT & SA (the REAL Bank of America), I bought this to see how the old Bank could get so taken by this guy. It confirmed what I'd already suspected, that the old BofA's wimpy management at the time was no match for this operator. Unfortunately, the book is pretty light on the merger details. It does contain some glaring errors about the old BofA.The book is way too long, and is essentially a big valentine to Hugh McColl.

THE BEST OF POP. This is Paulina Rubio's great work of art. She blends all kinds of rhytms, lyrics, and feelings that make of BORDER GIRL an excellent album worth buying it.My favorite ones are UNDENIABLE (recorder part in NY and part in Oslo, Norway), THE ONE YOU LOVE (That's PAULINA's seal), THE LAST GOODBYE (a "ranchera-hip-hop?" in English???). Yep, as Paulina says: "There are not rules when it all comes down to pop music."This album is way better than Shakira's, honestly. Buying this CD will be the best thing you can do.

I borrowed this from our Main Library since my branch's copy hadn't arrived yet--boy, am I sorry I wasted the Library's money! I think it was half the style of writing and half lack of information.

Another way of looking for the gap in history. The book was interesting. A short novel,with a different kind of look at pre history.

Purchased five months ago, developing tears despite only light use. I purchased this backpack about five months ago and initially was impressed with the product. It appeared sturdy and well-constructed and was reasonably comfortable to carry. I've been using it lightly since - no more than a couple of days a month carrying loads up to twenty pounds. Unfortunately the stitching at the bottom corners of the backpack (the bottom two corners of the main compartment that are closest to the wearer's back) has started to open up. One corner is entirely open such that there's a one inch gap in the corner through which objects can fall and the other corner is starting to unravel but is not yet open. I haven't been carrying any sharp or unusual objects that should cause this to happen so I have to give this product only two stars.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Total junk. I bought this bike from Toys'R'Us in a box and had to return it because it was next to impossible to assemble and overall built quality was horrible. This is an example of a product produced evidently without any quality control whatsoever. The front wheel was about 3-4 mm wider than the front fork which it was supposed to fit into. There were only two ways to get it in - use brutal force and expand the fork at a risk of damaging it or assemble it incorrectly by removing the nuts which should go inside of the fork. Perhaps this is how toy stores have to do it - but in this case I would not want this bike anyway. The wheel bearing felt overtightened to the level that wheel would not spin freely, the handlebars would turn only with signficant friction and effort. I was amazed to see what kind of junk this bike is. Stay away by all means.$LABEL$0,0,-100

What are people raving about? This movie was bad. Classic? Horror? I don't think so. I consider myself to be a film buff but I could hardly pay attention to this movie. The effects were comical, I would have laughed if I wouldn't had been so bored to tears. The plot was ridiculous and the characters were anemic. The most disappointing aspect was its failure to meet the hype.

Best in some respects. This is the best longwave UV flashlight I have ever used in terms of light quality, i.e. it has very little visible purple light.

WARNING: SAVE YOURSELF TEN BUCKS !. Well, somebody has got to be the first to review it, so here goes.Of all the country albums I've heard, this is definitely the worst ever! I bought it just for "A cowboy's born with a broken heart", expecting the rest to be in the same vein (at least the titles looked promissing). I don't know how the other albums by this band sound, but this is pathetic. You can hardly call this country music by any standard. The first couple of tracks sound more like "praise songs", the harmonies are almost gospel-like. The only tracks bearable are "In another tear from now", "If her heart ain't in Memphis" and the forementioned "A cowboy's born ...". Only the latter is really good, the other two being ruined somewhere down the line. ABSOLUTE LOW HOWEVER IS THE KINKS-COVER "YOU REALLY GOT ME".Verdict: one star for "A cowboy's born ..." and the effort. They should thank me for that one star.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Bad experience. I looked over the Internet for several screen protectors for my new PSP, and I found this one as the best option.(The screen protector from Sony it's only available in Japan).

If you have a thyroid problem this book won't help!. I read this book & was very disappointed. It has some basic things that anyone with a thyroid problem already knows.

Pinnacle Studio Ultimate Version 11. Pinnacle Studio Ultimate Version 11I've been using this product for about a month now. I used version 9xx for several years. Version 11 is much more stable; it maintains the same intuitive user interface; and in general, makes a rather complex process relatively simple. One caution: pay close attention to the RECOMMENDED system requirements (as opposed to the MINIMUM requirements). Any video editing package must necessarily utilize a lot of system horsepower and resources. So - unless you have the required system components - look to a more basic editing package.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Just Wait A Second. When people are saying this is the best punk album ever, that's quite ridiculous. I know there are at least two NoFX albums that are much better than this. "Ribbed" and the album everyone hates because it's raw "Liberal Animation". I read a review for this album that said My Hear Is Yearning an opera was 10/10 because of diversity! WTF! I didn't pick this cd up for an opera song, or a folk song. It's called diversity in a PUNK song. Diversity doesn't always meen a different genre, it can also meen a different style of punk. I also disagree when people say that this album get's five stars because sometimes you can't understand what the lead singer is saying.Well this cd really is good, but I'm sick of people saying this is the best cd because there is one diverse opera song.Best songs- Linoleum/Jeff Wears Birkenstocks/ Punk Guy$LABEL$1,0,-100
JAMES BOND LOSES. Why do most of John Gardner's James Bond novels seem like screenplays? I think that is what was always missing from his writings.

frustrated with product support. I offer this assessment with a certain amount of sorrow and I offer it on behalf of myself and the friend who I gave this item for Christmas last year.

I was told to buy the entire knock box bar and that was my only recourse. I found this to be very poor customer support.

FLA's most consistant effort. you really can't compare it to anything else. FLA is industrial...but...not. FLA has always been more subdued than, say, skinny puppy or ministry. more atmospheric. this is music you play while driving at NIGHT. its very sleek, and enjoyable from start to finish, but you have to listen for the little melodic, rhythmic, production complexities. its definitely a landmark album for industrial music, it announces the arrival of electro-industrial (just as NIN's Broken and Ministry's Psalm 69 did for industrial metal, the same year might I add). Personally i like Reclamation just as an overall snapshot of their career or Implode as an example of how far they've come, but after you pick up those amazing CDs this should definitely be the next to get.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Needs to be proofread!. I'm reviewing algebra after not doing math for almost 6 years. I already had a basic understanding of algebra from high school so this book is good in that it's straight to the point. I'm only about 1/4 of the way through and there's already been 3 instances where the examples have completely confused me because there are mistakes in the problems. Don't believe me? Check out page 14, they're switching the signs when finding the remainder but they don't mention it anywhere in the lesson. On page 40 the exponent is a typo so the solution makes no sense! These are just a few of the mistakes I've come across and I'm sure there will be more so if you're buying this book be prepared for confusion.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Small jobs only.. Yes it sucks more air than other battery powered vacuums but: in brief it is rather heavy and has very short battery life and no extension handle accessory. Even using the 18v so called long lasting $90 battery, it quits only after about 1,500 sq. ft of dusty floor space, about 15 minutes of use. Dewalt customer service said that it would pickup multiple bags of cement but it will NOT in my experience hardly do much dust off the floor. I spent $240 on the vacuum, charger, and best battery and feel this is too much for the results I got. The unit is light until the battery is put in then it is really heavy (I'm a 250lb man and think so). The body is wide bulky but should be narrow in format and longer since it bumps everything and bumps you in the side which is part of why it seems heavy.$LABEL$0,0,-100
awesome stability. The On Stage KT7800 Plus is an exceptional value. Final assembly can be completed within minutes--no tools are needed--just place the legs into place and slide the locking pegs into position and secure with a twist.

And that's the ones I remember!The cinemaphotography, as usual in this series, was excellent. Whether it was watching the sea eagle hunt (it is so effective it only needs 10 minutes a day) or being taken through the undersea kelp forests (150-feet high!), the viewer is immersed in a wealth of sights and sounds.Great program on Tasmania and its wildlife.

Fraught with fallacy. Polyamory works (quite well actually) when the central character is young and attractive and horny. Add a few years that bring droop, sag and jiggly jowls.

Then the whole concept goes to hell in a hand basket. Polyamory is our era's freak-show-du-jour. Our alternative to the failed free-love mish-mash of the 60s.

Lacking in the basics. As with most pose books, there is a severe lack of detail and contrast in the photos. The purpose of this book is to provide an alternative to life drawing, but fails in the very aspect of life drawing that makes it so effective. With such poor photography, it is extremely difficult to discern the surface features that are so important to learning artistic human anatomy. While the poses have a slightly more natural bend than most books in this genre, there is still an unnatural stiffness, or exaggeration of movement that is rarely every desired in figure references. In addition, all of the models are young college age people, with little or no ethnic diversity.The overall direction of this book attempts to provide the artist with a holistic smattering of references in anatomy, movement and lighting, but fails in all three catagories, badly. I don't recommend this book to anyone with serious ambitions in learning to draw the human figure.$LABEL$0,0,-100

History of the American Revolution made fun!. In preparation on a column that I am doing for middle and teen readers on espionage, I picked this title up at the library on the recommendation of the young adult librarian. What a great suggestion! Allen does a fantastic job of leading the reader through the incredible story of spying, double agents, and treason during the Revolutionary War. This book has it all - invisible ink, disguises, codebooks, hidden messages, and more. And readers are invited to test themselves at decoding, using a "mask", and other spy talents. Recommended for school use in American History units, and for anyone (gr 4 and up) that is looking for something really different and entertaining, while being completely factual!

A seminal work in international relations. Many criticisms to Waltz's work are unfounded, in that the book is not intended to be an end all for explaining wars in international relations. It does however, provide the reader with a theoretical framework of international relations. The three images of analysis provide for a generalization of the system in which war is promulgated. This book and a bevy of later works argue what level of analysis is best at explicating the cause of war. Don't read this book as a means to finding a simplistic answer to the cause of war, rather read it with the hope of gaining a better understanding of the causes of war.For those interested in international relations, Keohane and Nye's works are very worthwhile.$LABEL$1,0,-100

One of the best albums ever made. 6 stars!. Words cannot describe how incredible this album is, but I'll try. First of all, this is easily one of my favorite 10 albums of all time. I can't get the songs out of my head... the music is so catchy, AND the lyrics are so intelligent and piercing! E experiments with a few different styles here, from harder stuff like Mental to funk like Guest List, to more depressing slow stuff like Manchild. My favorites are Not Ready Yet, Flower, Guest List, Your Lucky Day in Hell, and Manchild. However, it's ALL great stuff. The only low points for me are Mental and Spunky, but that's only because they're not INCREDIBLE like the rest of the songs... they're still very good by normal standards though!

Disgusting. This book claims to be like 50 Shades of Grey. It is NOTHING like 50 Shades. This book is full of endless torture and rape. The sexual situations are not consenual between parties. I read about half of the first book and then returned the second and third. This is very dark and very disturbing. Not sure why someone would write and sell this garbage.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Simple toy but classic fun. This is a very simple toy, doesn't make noise, basic shape sorter. And we like it! My son is under 12 months, but he enjoys handling the animals, opening the barn door, and I go over the letters and animal names with him. It's easy to clean, which I like. I'd say this is good from over 6 months to whenever they get bored with it. It's a colorful toy at a reasonable price! (if you get it on sale, like I did!)$LABEL$1,0,-100

.... Hmmm... now, could someone tell me where I've heard this before...death guitar samples, machine gun beats, and loud screaming. OH! WAIT! Atari teenage riot! Now don't get me wrong, the album is OK, but ATR does it 100 times better. Believe me, Im a HUGE Digital Hardcore fan, i own at least one album of every DHR artist. Im also willing to forgive the fact that Ec8or aren't very original, im somewhat lenient on that, but the truth is the only good songs on the album are; "i dont wanna be a part of this", "think about", and "spex is a fat B!tch".

God awful. Dali is correct about this CD. This is just another crappy screamo band with no talent. Iron Maiden had 3 guitarists at one point. Unlike this band, they made it work. The stupid singer/guitarist has to have the ****ty bassist do the "hardcore screams". These guys fall under the same pile of **** as bands like My Chemical Romance and Silverstein. They're another band that appeals to the brainwashed MTV masses. These guys can take their stupid radio with them while they slit their wrists, because i'll be listening to Iron Maiden instead.UP THE IRONS!

Chick Lit at it's Best!. I loved Billerbeck's Ashley Stockingdale Series, so I was eager to see if her new Spa Girls Series had the same sass and flair. I was not disappointed! In this series, there are three friends who meet regularly at a day spa to re-connect and work out their problems. All three characters are well-drawn and interesting--which only makes you long for the next book in the series. The star of this one, Lilly, is a flawed, quirky, and completely lovable financial guru turned fashion designer. I enjoyed getting a peak into the fashion industry. As with all of Billerbeck's books, there is a romantic thread that has you guessing til the end which guy will be The One. It's a rare book that can make me laugh out loud, but this one had me cackling several times. I can't wait to see what happens in the next installments of Spa Girls!$LABEL$1,0,-100

What Was All The Hoopla About?. I had heard that Eyes Wide Shut wasn't any good, but I went ahead and rented it to see what all the "talk" was about. What a terrible dissapointment!

Not to be Missed. I am a life-long fan of Shirley Jackson and, especially, "The Haunting of Hill House." It is only recently that I have had the opportunity to read many of her works which, for some unknown reason, are out-of-print. "The Sundial" is, at the same time, psychologically unnerving and immensely humorous. It is quite disturbing to read about the rantings of Aunt Fanny and the schemes of Fancy. But, at the same time, to imagine this handful of awful people who hate each other unendingly having to spend eternity with one another is incredibly funny. I must admit, I was a little disappointed when the book ended, but I realize that it must have been in the master plan of the author to leave the reader without the information which would have unnecessarily cleared up questions which will instead linger on the mind.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Two Large Baoxers love this bed. We have had this bed for a couple of weeks now and both our boxers (one 95lb and one 75lb) love it. We use it inside and put a small blanket on it. The cover alone seemed a little rough. I love it because I can vac all around and under it, instead of having to move the dog bed every time I vac. I rated it a four star because it arrived with missing parts. I called the factory and they immediately sent the part to me. It was just a matter of having to wait the extra week. It does take up quit a bit of room, but hey, it's a large bed for large dogs. I had no big problem putting it together and so far see no bending of the frame, possibly a slight sag in the material although the dogs are still elevated off the floor even when both of them are on the bed at the same time. And I don't foresee the material stretching any further. For the price and even much more, I don't think you can get a better bed. We have placed an order or another, the dogs are tired of sharing.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!. In this book the Baudelaire are faced with numerous of situations that can change there lifes forever. They must once agein try proving count ofal's identity, run laps every night, pass many exams, and still manage to sleep. But, with the help of there friends, the two Quagmire triplets, they manage to survive. Until something terrible happenes to Quagmire triplets, thanks to there own forturn, and coach Genghis.I think this book is the best in its series, this is because it has a little bit of everything in it, and you can relate to it more than the other books. This is because, it is all about thehaving to deal with unfairness, and I am sure we all think we have that. But from werid teachers, to even bullys, the Baudelaires have another adventure that is worth reading, so go and read this book I'm sure you woun't put it down!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Novel Says Nothing. This novel is boring, has a jumbled beginning, drags in the middle and rushes the ending.

Protector of the Small #3- Squire. I actually thought this book was better then the one before it (Page) which surprised me as usually I find in Tamora Pierce's quartets the first book is the best, then they get slowly a little worse each time. But even though Kel wasn't working aound the palace any more, this book was still really intresting and it was great that it was a lot longer then the first two books. I have one complaint: Cleon. ....Otherwise the book was brilliant. I loved all the bits with jousting and Kel's visions outside the Chamber of the ordeal. I now think I undestand what the Ordeal does; as well as making Kel face her fears inside the chamber, it set her a challenge for the future, as it did Alanna ( Kel's was the metal machines-Alanna's was Duke Roger.) A great addition to this quartet and I'm really looking forward to reading book 4, Lady Knight.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Price is ridiculous - buy it at shopkitchenaid.com. I saw in another review that someone regretted not purchasing it at the KitchenAid site. I just went to the KA site, didn't see the jar and chatted with their online help - they did confirm to me that the "KitchenAid Pro Line Coffee Mill Replacement Bin" SKU:KPCGBIN was indeed the correct part. Oddly enough, there is no picture of the "bin" but that's why KA has an online help system I suppose. Anyway, I ordered two (one for backup just in case - mama isn't kind without her coffee). Total cost for two, shipped, plus tax was under $30.I'm all about making a profit but when you can get it for less than half price by going direct to the KA site, one would be foolish not to.Happy shopping!$LABEL$0,0,-100

EEEEEPPPPPP! This Mouse Roars!.... I received this mouse as a gift and I like it. It fits my hand perfect (as a right hander.) If a left hander were to use my mouse they would find it very uncomfortable (if using with their left hand.) The thumb button is great to re-program for games. The wheel is smoother then the Microsoft Optical counterpart.I use the keyboard whenever possible for shortcut keys but some activities such as surfing the web and playing games can be greatly enhanced by having a good mouse. This mouse has fulfills all the needs I have.Optical is the way to go if you spend large amounts of time at a PC. It avoids the snags and slowdowns of non-optical mice. The optical logo is nice if your in the dark (and your monitor goes to sleep) so you can quickly grab the mouse and active the monitor.This is a great affordable mouse. It's a must get if your still using a non-optical or non-wireless mouse!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Excellent compressor. The MF-1052 works. I would give it 5 stars if it had standard fittings. I will need to replace the fittings. But it works. I filled my trailer tires (225/75/15) in just a couple minutes. I was worried because this is not the model that got such rave reviews on the 4WD sites but it looks exactly like the 1050 model and the performance must be pretty close. You cannot use this through the cigarette lighter, you must connect to battery with included clips. This is a good thing because it is more powerful than most small compressors.

A Childhood Classic Read. My grandson, 3 yrs old, is a big fan of Thomas the Tank. This classic tale has become a favorite already, I think because it does have colorful drawings of the story and, it is about trains. He thinks twice now about saying " I can't". If he does, Grandma quietly repeats " I think I can, I think I can...". He will grin and forge ahead with the task or skill he was attempting.It is often one of his picks for a bedtime story.

Good, but . . .. This could be the kind of novel that readers love -- a keep-you-on-edge-of-your-seat kind of novel. But somewhere along the line, the writer has to deliver, has to get the reader to believe in something, even if there's an unexpected twist at the end. This novel never makes the last jump. Even at the end, you're left with questions, unsatisfied. The writing is good -- different because its third person, present tense -- but expert. Only the ending, the relationship between the two primary characters, rings false. I would read more books by Mr. Stone in spite of my reservations about this one. Still, a worthwhile read.$LABEL$1,0,-100

DVD Packaging is UNACCEPTABLE!. What is WRONG with this company? Season 11 was released with packaging that didn't allow for removing the discs without destroying them. You can't take them out to play or you risk ruining them. STUPID!!!Virtually every review by customers complained about this and it looks like sales plummented for season 12. I am a hardcore fan, BUT...I want new boxes for seasons 11 and 12, or I won't be purchasing ANYTHING from them again.Season six shipped with a new format package and cover (which didn't ruin the DVDs) and eventually FOX offered a replacement box so that it matched seasons 1 - 5. You would have figured that FOX learned their lesson from this.

Ok product, accesories needed and wrench failed. I used the Tool Force product for several hours; I was trying to spray latex paint onto a wooden surface.Things I knew:1)I would need additional accessories that did not come with the gun (water/oil separator)2)The included 2.0 tip is recommended to spray latex paint.Things I did not know:1)The gun came with the 1.4 tip pre installed. I attempted to remove the 1.4 tip but the open ended wrench bent. I soldered on.2)1.4mm is too small for latex materials (unless you want to use the gun all day)3)I couldn't find a replacement wrench and thus the gun is ruined (full of dried paint)4)A $10 equivalent (sans the 2.0mm tip) is available at your local harbor freight.If the wrench wasn't so cheaply made, I would be giving this product a 4 star rating. Tool Force is probably made by the same people who made the HF model. They look identical. I would opt for the cheaper option and buy the 2.0 tip separately if I was doing this again.$LABEL$0,0,-100

LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. I think that the Lemony Snicket Movie was great! There's only one thing I can say bad about it: Klaus (pronounced Kl-OW-ss and not Clause) just wasn't right! He didn't have glasses and his face just wasn't, well, right! Liam Aiken is a great actor and all but just not right for the role. Other than that, it was great. I will admit I was a bit worried about Jim Carrey as Count Olaf (I thought he might be a bit TOO goofy) but he turned out to be great for the part.

Best OIF documentary. This is by far the best war documentary that covers the current conflicts. I am a Soldier with 2 tours in Iraq and I think this story is amazing. The actual Documentary itself was very well made and the whole thing is a tear fest. It is insane what these guys went through and I think every American should watch this film, these Marines of Lima CO are an inspiration for me. I am a Combat medic (the equivalent of a Corpsman) in the Army and for those of you that want to see the average experiences of the infantry in Iraq, this isn't average, this is the worst case scenerio.Another film that is worth watching and I think shows the average experience of life in Iraq is Occupation: Dreamland, which follows the 82nd. Another one is Gunner Palace and it does reflect how a lot of support personnel are living in Iraq, yet the troops in it are an embarrassment to the Army. An amazing documentary that covers WW2 is The War by Ken Burns, nothing compares to it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

I wore the shoes for the first time today at work, on carpet, and the sole of one of the shoes is already starting to peel off. Note that I did not wear the shoes from my car in the parking lot to the office. I put them on once I arrived in the office, and I sat at my desk for the majority of the day.

A real man would strive to be sexually pure for God, his wife or future wife, as well as himself. The author has helped me put up safeguards to protect myself from Satan's attacks.

Rio Carbon 5G Mp3. Rio Carbon 5G Mp3 player does an overall good job. It's hard to find another player that has this much space for the price. A couple of flaws that need to be addressed are:1. The player tends to freeze and need to be re-booted if the charge is low.2. Books parts tend to load onto the player out of order even when you've synced them to the player in order. The most common problem is that part 10 will come after part 1 of the book so if you're not paying attention you're suddenly at the end of the book.

This book is a map or a model of spiritual ascension that can be used by anyone, as ascension is affecting everyone on the planet.It is not written in a linear manner, so certain sections will "spring out" to you depending upon where you are in the lightbody process.For beginners, it makes no sense upon the first read, and sounds crazy on the second read. It is designed to bury pieces of its truth within your spirit.

A walk back 30+ years. I first heard Rare Bird in late 1973 and fell in love with "Hey Man". I bought the album (remember albums?), then lent it to a friend in the late 70's and never saw it again. For 25 years I've tried to find a copy and was amazed when I saw Epic Forest available on Amazon. As soon as I received and played the CD it brought me right back to the 70's. Yet the sounds of this band are timeless. I hear shades of Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, Stevie Winwood, Steely Dan and Jethro Tull in the unique style of Rare Bird. The vocal harmonies, acoustics, and hard licks are in great diversity, but make the listening very easy. I realize that I had pretty good musical tastes 30+ years ago. I just wonder why the band wasn't a greater commercial success. This was a purchase that I will cherish for a long time.Epic Forest$LABEL$1,0,-100

Best Wok. I researched other Wok's before I chose this one. I liked all the reviews this was getting, so I took a chance. Like any other review, there will be some people that do not like it. This Wok makes excellent food! I love it! Curing instructions come with it. Just follow them and and BAM, you'll be set. The Wok comes oiled up, to prevent rust. So that will have to be washed. Like I said, the curing instructions come with it, so just follow it. Tells you the proper steps to follow. If I had to but another Wok for whatever reason, I would definitely buy another one of these! Like always, shipping was awesome....it got to my house so fast.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Does this stuff work at all?. We have three adult indoor cats in Seattle in our small home. Recently one of our cats got outdoors and we ended up with fleas. We used this exact product and three weeks later we noticed nothing had changed. There where still fleas. So we applied the other dose and three weeks later we have seen a 0% decrease in flea popuation. This cost us 100$ and we do not make loads of money so to spend 100$ on a product that did NOTHING is quite a loss. I will never buy Frontline again in this lifetime.$LABEL$0,0,-100

In puragorys shadow and by infernos light. Worf and Garak go into the gamma quadrant to investigate a cardassian code whice garak claims was sent by tain the former leader of the obsidian order. They progress further into the gamma quadrant where they are captured by gem hadar. Worf is forced to fight the gemhadar while garak engineers their escape from the dominion prison camp . It is a great episode which is one of my favorites it shows worfs true test of klingon honor and spirit.meanwhile on ds9 doctor bashier was replaced by a changeling where he is damageing station systems and would be sucessful if doctor bashier wouldnt have hailed the station from the gamma quadrant.A taskforce of klingon ships arrive from cardassian space and gowron agrees to ally the klingon empire with the federation once again and it is the beginning of the dominion war saga a must see !!$LABEL$1,0,-100
It's bad!. I used to play this game over my cousin's house. Besides the hideous 2D graphics, the plot must have been stolen or something because I sure couldn't find it.

An Inspirational Movie. The beautiful story of the appearance of Our Lady to poor peasant children in Portugal is well told and portrayed.

AWFUL BOOK AND VERY BORING. I found this tale extremely well written but also very boring and gruesome.

Boring. I finally caught up with this film, and, like so many high profile classics, I found it to be tedious. The script lumbered along and I found no enthusiasm for any of the characters.

Good Book, some problems with it.. This was required reading for a class I was taking in multicultural issues. It was very interesting but it was hard to read parts of it because of the nature of confronting our biases that the book addresses. I did have some issues with the way the book approached discussing the role of white people in society. It was almost as if the authors wanted me to feel bad about being white. Overall it was very informative and gave really good examples and implications for clinical use.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Worthless for 90 degree cuts. The product description is misleading: there IS an attachment for doing 45 degree cuts and that works - not great but does work. The problem is that this tool does nothing to help with perfect 90 degree cuts. The description says you use the flat base for 90 degree cuts, but that doesn't really do anything for you. I can make cuts easier with a regular X-acto knife, or a single edge razor blade which is what I ended up using because I felt it gave me better control than this tool.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Driving Rain. I do not own "Driving Rain" at this time, however, I'm sure I would love it. Anything, Sir Paul does I love it, he's a great person and a talent writer, singer,composser and musician. I wish him all the happiness life can bring. When the Beatles first came to the US, I was a died hard "Elvis" fan, still am, however, Sir Paul is now tired with "Elvis" in my heart. I saw his concert on 4th of July at RFK stadium, in Washington, DC, wow! what a concert. I got the same feeling seeing Sir Paul, as I did when I saw "Elvis" in concert, both a once in a life time concert. Paul, be safe and happy always.

Unsubstantiated Junk. Sadly, this book is actually assigned reading in some colleges and universities, which means students will believe as fact its rather thin argument that industrial development in the world stems from a decline in the value placed on womanhood. The author apparently hasn't studied the very real oppression of women during earlier time periods in history. This is junk social science, and, horrifically has been given credibility it does not deserve. Admittedly, the premise is unique. The 'academics' behind the premise, however, are weak at best, and downright dangerous at worst. Connections are drawn with no grounds other than the author's personal claim that various advances in industry or science are related to anti-faminist attitudes and have sexual undertones.If you like this book, you'll love the equally distorted sexual references in Spinning Straw Into Gold (by Gould).$LABEL$0,0,-100
I tried so hard to like this book.... I tried so hard to like this book. The story is a magnificent one, the history so alive but I couldn't get myself past the fact that a 6-8 year old could be so wordly and articulate. Her obsession and goal to marry Prince Salim from such a young age held little ground. No reason or impetus was given for this sudden aspiration. I only got to chapter 3 when I had to put it down as it lacked conviction and authority.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Sophomoric story signifying nothing. Johnston revealed his lack of sophistication and understanding of our tax system and how we got to where we are now.

A Swell Pioneer Aviation Book. Ms. Cummins has produced a very attractive small volume on Blanche Stuart Scott, pioneer aviator. The volume is well designed, as might be expected from a mainline publisher (Harper Collins) and the text is informative. While the book yields a good notion of who Ms. Stuart Scott was, a better exposition of Ms. Stuart Scott's 'crustiness' would probably have increased our understanding. There are the inevitable errors, of course, including an unfortunate caption of a photograph (on page 49) mistakenly identifying Lincoln Beachey as the aviator of a Wright biplane. Also, there is confusion about the supposed role of a non-existent sand bag in the fatal fall of Harriet Quimby and William Willard at Squantum, Massachusetts, in 1911. Taken as a whole, however, this book is well worth the purchase price and adds to our knowledge of one of the most colorful aviators of the pre-WWI period.$LABEL$1,0,-100

It cheats!. This game is well done, fun, and addictive, BUT it cheats. There are a small number of words in its dictionary that do not appear in the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (4th edition). It beat me tonight (barely) by using GADJO. If you look this up in the OSPD4, it isn't there. If you look it up in its own online version, it's there, but with "Definition not available". If you look it up in Google, it's a Barcelona-based gypsy-ska group, which gets its name from the Roma word for non-Romanji people. (That's the sort of obscure word that Scrabble lives by, but to use such a word when it is NOT in the OSPD is just cheating!)

very nice and heavy but not white. This spoon rest is a nice shape and nice and heavy like the Corningware bakewear.

The rooster and hen match my kitchen decor but the main color itself is beige/dark ivory/cream-just not white.

Not In My Back Yard. An old dog professsional photographer temporarily bed ridden (due to an accident)(James Stewart). A junior socialite (Grace Kelly) looking to get hitched to old dog photographer. A back yard full of troubled `lonely crowd' urban neighbors in 1950's New York. Bring in a salesman (Raymond Burr) neighbor (could it be Willie Loman going off the edge) in an unhappy marriage. Add in the master suspense director Alfred Hitchcock and you have the making of a classic suspense thriller. The plot revolves around the clues picked up by Stewart as he, out of boredom or otherwise, hones in on the apartment across the way. By the time Stewart and crew are done old Raymond Burr is going to need more than Perry Mason to get out of this fix. A word on Grace Kelly. They say Prince Rainer of Monaco, her husband, a man not known for showing emotion openly cried when she died in that car accident long ago. Now I know why. Enough said.$LABEL$1,0,-100
More than a Mirage. When Transformers started relaunching G1 characters as modern, re-tooled versions in the Generations line I was stoked. Born in the early 80's I wasn't able to enjoy the original toys unless I went to older kid's houses. I loved the cartoon and the characters. Now with these toys, especially Mirage here, I'm able to enjoy and appreciate them as a homage as well as fully posable action figures that are able to capture the essence of the character in Robot mode as well as a realistic vehicle mode.

Deftly analyzes over 2,000 of Koryusai's designs. Isoda Koryusai produced thousands of designs between 1769 and 1781, a crucial period in the Japanese print tradition era, and though he was honored in Japan for his works, he's been largely neglected by western art scholars. Allen Hockley's The Prints Of Isoda Koryusai deftly analyzes over 2,000 of Koryusai's designs, surveying his influence as a minor Edo-period artist and arguing that Koryusai excelled in his output and his creation of popular commodities. The Prints Of Isoda Koryusai is essential reading for any student of Japanese printmaking history and artists.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Beautifully Overrated Gem. Perhaps if the book had not received the prize and so much praise I would have been pleasantly surprised, but after all the hype I would tend to agree with the dissenters here below, that The Hours, although superbly crafted and elegantly written, is a hollow and ultimately disappointing reference to Virginia Woolf's masterpiece. Cunningham's prose moved me, but his invented characters did not. (Of course Virginia herself is untouchable.)

Vapid and inane. A total embarrassment to the author. Dull and poorly written. After forcing myself to get through the first 45 pages, I gave up. This book is perhaps faithful to the A&E movie---certainly not to the original Austen book. It has Bingley as OWNER of Netherfield (he is only renting it!) and ignores the fact that the BENNETS are the first family of the village; hence Caroline would have had to socialize with them whether she wanted to or not---certainly before accepting an invitation from Colonel Forster!! This is only the beginning of the ludicrous inaccuracies. The book is also dreadfully copy-edited; I found the same kinds of errors my high school students routinely make.

An insult to the legacy of James Brown. This concert is obviously being marketed by it's historical context, taking place on the night after Dr. King's assassination.

Great toy!. I bought this for a joined Christmas present for my 3 and 4 year old, not sure whether it was going to be a bust or something that they could really enjoy at such a young age. My 3 year old has a little trouble getting more complex structures built because of how strong the magnets are, but my 4 year old LOVES them. She has declared them her favorite toy of the holiday, and plays with them constantly. The magnets are of such great quality, and are built to last. Even though you are only given the little bars and the silver balls, the possibilities are endless. They come packaged great, so it's easy to tell if any pieces have gone missing. I would recommend this to anyone. More than just the average toy you find nowadays, where lights and sounds and flashy things replace quality and actual entertainment value!$LABEL$1,0,-100
A Welcome Change in Sytemic Thinking. This book presents a revolutionary, yet simple thesis on the Bible's teaching about "divorce." For too many years churches have burdened divorced individuals with the feeling that they are somehow now "disqualified" because of it. Divorce has been treated as an almost "unpardonable sin." Callison's book dispells this attitude and belief by simply pointing out the translations of the O.T. Hebrew words and the N.T. Greek words used for "bill of divorce" and "putting away." It is a welcome message that should help countless divorced people regain the joy of their relationship with God.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Dissapointing. I feel I must agree with Greg B. To say a movie wasn't good because it wasn't the same as the book it was based upon is ridiculous, for film must follow different conventions than the written word. HOWEVER, that maxim is true only most of the time. Sometimes, what was left out of a film in the transfer from book to screen would have made a better cinematic impression . Such is the case with "A Simple Plan". Scott Smith more than likely felt compelled to water down his novel to fit Hollywood's narrow views of what makes a successful movie. He probably felt he had managed to still retain the spirit and impact of the book. Sorry,Scott, but I disagree. It was bungled badly, and what could have been a truly chilling morality tale ended up a by the numbers actiion thriller, with a thin moral fabric tacked on as an afterthought. Fair at best, only because a fine cast of actors save what should have rated zero stars. A dissapointment.$LABEL$0,0,-100

predictable, pedestrian mystery. This "femjep" mystery has all of the flaws of a beginning effort and few of the charms. The focus is really on the relationship between reporter Irene Kelly and detective Frank Harriman. Solving the mystery is almost incidental. And Irene doesn't do much investigating. Things happen to her and she overlooks obvious clues (e. g., the cable truck sitting outside her house for several days). She finds herself in far more physical danger than any one person would face in a lifetime, and yet the solution to the crime pops up when she isn't even looking for it. Burke has an annoying habit of trying to misdirect the reader -- which a mystery writer is supposed to do -- but in such a heavy-handed way that no reasonably intelligent reader is going to be fooled.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Authentic powerful blend of traditional songs and creativity. Picked this CD up at Wupatki National Monument out west. The songs are based on traditional Hopi songs but with embellishments such as flute and occasional background nature sounds. A great mix of drumming, chanting, rattlework. Definately easier for most westerners to listen to than powwow songs. A bit more tribal than the latest Carlos Nakai but generally in that genree. Sounds somewhere between Nakai and Douglas Blue Feather. Really suprisingly great stuff.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Fun little game. I love doing Jumbles - I buy all of the Jumble books I can find. The hand-held version is not as entertaining as the books because it doesn't have the cartoons, and you can't see the bonus puzzle letters until you get to the bonus puzzle, but for when you're on the road, it's better than lugging a book and a pencil. Very easy to use, and well made, though I wish the display was a little easier to read in dim light.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Parent Trap, updated. What an adorable story.

Not What I Expected. Although the book is very interesting, it really didn't have in it what I thought would be in it. I actually bought the book for my husband, who is into model rocketry and is making his own rocket engines and I thought this book would be informative enough to teach him to make the black powder that goes in them. Well, it is...if you have ten years to wait for everything to cure and get to a point where it's "good" enough to use for black powder. I really did think he could put the knowledge he gained there to work immediately and therefore I was disappointed in the content of the book. If you have ten years to wait for everything to come together then this is a book for you. If you want to put the knowledge to work for you right away, forget it!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Worked great!. I had to do a few runs of Cat6 through my attic into 3 rooms in my home. This really helped a lot. Sure you could make your own or use a different kind of device (originally I used a wire hanger), but this did the job better.

Huge Hit.. FIRST IMPRESSION: This toy was a big hit with the kids the moment they tried it out.DURABILITY: Initially I thought it looked a bit flimsy, but it's been a while and everything is still intact and working perfectly.CUSTOMER SERVICE: The box was missing one item when it arrived. We called the company and got the part within the same week, with a few extra parts along with it. Customer service from that company is fantastic. They were very polite and resolved our problem right away.FUN FACTOR: The rockets go very high, and kids in our area congregate in our yard to have a turn at stomping. It really is a lot of fun for both kids and adults as well.RECOMMENDATION: Give it try. Most kids flip out for this toy.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Cold and unmoving. In 1970, Twentieth Century Fox released "M*A*S*H," a huge box-office smash that put Elliott Gould on the map, and established Robert Altman, a veteran director of TV's "Bonanza," as one of the important figures of 1970's cinema. Much like Gould, Altman quickly burned out, and there's hardly a spark of imagination to be found in "Quintet."Set in some barren wasteland of the future, it involves a macabre twist on backgammon in which the loser is murdered. The location, a snow swept Montreal, and the contrasting claustrophobic interior scenes, are appealing to the eye, and the cast, headed by Paul Newman, is not without interest.But "Quintet" is as cold and unmoving as its landscapes, simply another credit in Altman's filmography that boasts of his maverick credentials, but makes you wonder why "maverick credentials" are something to boast about.Brian W.

Amazing Durability!. I bought this camera for my daughter 2 years ago. My 3 kids play with it frequently. It has been dropped on the tile floor many times without breaking. Last week, my 3 year old son put the camera in the bathtub. It was completely submerged. You could see water inside the view finder and on the screen. I was certain it had finally met its demise. However, I took the batteries out and dried it as best I could for 5 days. Today, I put the batteries back in and much to my surprise it STILL WORKS!!

A FIVE STAR SONG A TWO STAR ALBUM. As many fellow reviewers assert, there's only one real reason to own this history-making CD: the nearly 17 minute version of LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY.The irresistibly danceable disco-erotica features Donna's moans and groans but it's the structuring of the glorious music that makes this such an awesome track. Each section has its own unique feel, culminating in the choral climax (no pun intended!) and a return to the whispery sparse opening, and then another choral eruption. Probably the best disco recording ever!The rest of the album is basically boring pap...but Donna's voice prophesies her future vocal triumphs.The aforementioned 17 minutes makes this a must-have for discophiles.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Too Much Allegory... Read Love Wins Instead. I tried to get into this literary classic and just couldn't quite understand it. It came highly recommended to me by a friend of mine because he knew I had just read and enjoyed Rob Bell's, "Love Wins". Apparently Lewis and Bell think similarly on issues relating to Heaven, Hell, and the afterlife. But, there was just too much use of allegory and symbolism in "The Great Divorce" that I couldn't bring myself to finish it simply for a lack of understanding on my part. If I can't understand a book then I don't see the sense in continuing to read it. And, so I reluctantly stopped reading this one about halfway through. If you have no problem understanding allegory, then I recommend this book. But, if you are like me and find it difficult to understand allegory, then save yourself the time and read Love Wins instead.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Ricks has broken the code. Remarkable: a reporter who apparently has no military service but demonstrates an unusual understanding of the military and its many subcultures. From a purely literary standpoint it's journeyman stuff; only a few minor characters really flesh out to three dimensions, and the plot goes off the rails at the end. But the novel's main conceit (an e-mail revolution within the US Army officer corps) and its principal theme - where does duty lie? - are well-developed. Military officers should read this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

My First Anita Shreve novel-My last. As an avid reader, I have always prided myself on getting through books quickly, thoroughly, and always shutting the final page with a satisfied sigh and a feeling of wonderment. There has been only one exception-this novel. I found it very difficult to get through, as the narrator is a despicable bore. Although Anita Shreve portrays the Victorian era very well, I found the descriptions to be dry and lacking in imagination. The beginning and middle lasted far too long, and the ending was too short,although I was grateful that my misery was finally at an end. This was my first Anita Shreve novel and as other reviewers have described this work as one of her best, it is sure to be my last.$LABEL$0,0,-100

this is trash. ok i know bands are supposed to evolve into newer sounds. however, they've completely lost that gritty sound that made them so appealing, the lyrics are mediocre at best (esp bev. hills & we are all on drugs are painful to listen to) and the album lacks the intensity of several of the previous ones. and i have a high tolerance for crappy weezer. of course i liked blue and pinkerton best. but i liked maladroit too! and even green! but this is marginally acceptable. Rivers Cuomo is essentially mocking me because i know he can do better and he isn't, on purpose, just to piss me off. I mean, i heard they picked from over 200 songs the ones that go on this album, and that makes me wonder what the rejected songs sound like (really really bad?) and how much time they actually spend on each song. Like it'd be impressive if the album was good, but it's not.$LABEL$0,0,-100
NOT a feelgood movie but a must see. If there ever was a more powerful movie than this I have yet to see it. I have seen this movie several times since it's release in 1983 and the effect has always been the same. You go to bed and it replays in your head then you wake up and it dominates your entire following day. With performances so powerful from Jane Alexander and others that you will never forget. Also this movie makes use of scenes with children asking their innocent questions as they do that will tear your heart apart as they are among the first to succumb to the radiation sickness. So if you want to see a film that will be hard to shake from your memory for weeks but will not leave you feeling particularly happy this is the ticket. I personally think it should be required viewing in all schools across America to remind our young that there are some things much more important than the latest Britney and N' Sync releases.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Pretentious and boring.. This magazine is really horrendous--long, wandering, and pedantic articles guaranteed to make you sleep. The most recent issue has a rather pointless story on what kind of debaters Obama and Romney are and how they will most likely fare against each other. After endless paragraphs we finally learn that Obama is a pretty good debator, by God, and that Romney is too. But here's the big dramatic point: Romney sometimes gets flustered when he debates. Stop the presses!A second article goes over familiar territory: if you're against Obama, you're a racist. Except in this case, the writer really means it. You can't say anything bad about Obama because he's black and most likely you aren't. So stop complaining about him. Because if you do, you're a racist.Why would anyone pay a subscription for this kind of stuff?$LABEL$0,0,-100

Nevertheless i read on, hoping to find an ending worthwhile, only find the book ending abruptly without satisfying me.

Collimation Easily Done. When I received it the collimation was off. Rather than send it back and risk getting another pair that was off, I called Celestron. The "Life Time No Fault Warranty" only applies if you get it from an "authorized" dealer even though my pair was new. Which means you need to pay like $200+ for these to actually have a warranty. However I asked if I could collimate it myself even though the manual says it should only be done by a professional with specialized tools. They could not or would not tell me anything about how to collimate it. Luckily I did find some general instructions on the web and found the prism tilt screws to turn and got it perfect. You need to gently pry back the edge of the rubber hand grips to access the screws. It whole process wasn't even that difficult! I don't know why it has to be such a state secret with Celestron.

It was great!. I read this book a few months after it came out and have recommended it to many since. The story takes place in the San Francisco bay area and makes its way to the pacific coast and all the way to eastern Canada. During this story I thought the 'psycho' nephew Nicholas was the main charactor. He fit in perfectly, The story is about his Aunt (who is in a bad marriage) and who falls head over heals for an eligible bachlor -- a pianist who is gay. I think everyone in this story had 'a few screws loose'. This made the story all the more pleasing because in everyone's life there are people like this.The main charactor turns out to be Nicholas's aunt Joyclyn. The ending may surprise you. This is a book to read on a recliner, when ou just feel like letting go of your troubles and reading about the zaniness that others possess. A strong recommendation$LABEL$1,0,-100
pretty nice. I haven't had any trouble standing this up and don't find it cheap looking at all. I use it as decoration in my room and to hide my hamper and it has been great. Have had it for a year, light portable and pretty!

Awesome shaver!!!. This is one of the best shavers on the market. Whatever they say about Norelco being the best,I think Panasonic rocks when it comes to shavers. My husband's been using a 7xxx model for 3 years now and I decided to buy a new, more advanced, model for him since he's been kind of reluctant to shave lately. And, needless to say, I like him better with smooth and soft shaved skin...The result- he's been shaving every 2 days thanks to the fact this model makes less noise, has a great easy-grip design, recharges incredibly quickly and looks cool in the bathroom (Men love beautiful toys- from Gameboy Advance to Pro Curve shavers.) I'll buy him more Panasonic products in the future; recommend you to do the same; won't regret it!!!:)You'd ask "why 4 stars, then?" Well, lets leave some room for more HiTech advances...$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not that great- not worth the time. I had to read this book for a 7th grade report, and belive me, it was terrible. The whole school hated it, all the teachers too-except the ones who taught literature. Is this some universally bad book for kids, and great book for adults into literature? I strongly object one of the other reveiws,the one who says kids who don't like this book haven't read "great literature." I love to read, and even though Western novels aren't my favorite, I do know the difference between a good book and a bad one- this was clearly one bad book. Many reviewers say this book was too descriptive. It definatly was, but that is not a major reson to dislike this book. The major thing was that it was too boring, I couldn't read more than ten pages before starting to skip words, sentences, even paragraphs.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great survival product. This is a great survival product and works very well if you know how to use it. I actually bought two, one for practice and one for emergencies. This product will work even if wet, however I would only really use it as a last resort fire starter because lighters that you buy from the store do the same thing at a cheaper price. Nonetheless it is a good product to have on you for emergencies. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't come with a striker.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Everything's forgettable but the ending. Watching Remember Me is a strange and frustrating experience.For most of the time, it's a generic romantic movie about a brooding and troubled guy (Robert Pattinson) falling in love with a cute blonde (Emile de Ravin) and how that love helps lift him out of his funk to become the man we always knew he could be.

do not buy this comforter!. This comforter is a dud. It is advertised light weight because there is such a minimal amount of down. The cover is not white it is grey. It may have baffle box construction but the edges are cheaply made (not gusseted as would be expected on baffle box construction). This would have been our 3rd comforter in 43 years. Our 1st 2 were beautiful, plump, soft treasures and I was very excited about getting number 3 but now I am just very annoyed. I had it shipped 1-2 days shipping (not cheap) and now I have to send it back plus they do not honor Amazon Prime Shipping Think this time I am just going to buy from a Name Brand REPUTABLE company.

Lousy, Blurry, and returned for a refund. I bought this at CVS because we needed one immediately, to figure out if we should take our 3 year old to urgent care or wait and see if she was better in the morning. For the price, I knew/assumed it would be cheaply made, but hoped it would be adequate for the job. It was anything but. It's nothing but a penlight with a piece of mylar foil to reflect the light. Could not get the ear in focus at all, and it was difficult to keep turned on since you have to press and hold the pocket clip into the side of the light to turn it on. Never did see how my daughter's ear looked until we took her to the doctor and looked through his professional W/A unit.I also tried it on our 5 year old and my wife's ear, but had no better luck there. Returned it for a refund, and am now looking for a better unit to have for next time.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Self important and boring. No one can deny that this film is stunningly beautiful. The Montana scenery all captured by fine photography is wonderful. But, unfortuanately that's all the film has going for it. The acting is good and it's certaintly interesting to see Pitt, (looking alot like the young Redford), in his first major screen role but no one really makes much impression. Basically this is self important, one note movie about the susposed joys of family love brought together by the dullest of sports, fishing, with little plot, humour or suspense.

I GIVE IT AN 8 BUT NOT 10 !. I must say that this is a good book for everyone who want to learn JAVA. But I am sorry to say that this book is only a refrence for JAVA but not a bible for JAVA. I have to say that because in this book the authors only briefly show the way to compile the source code and not explain it in detial. This problem may be seem is minor, but for a new programmer this is a great problem. This is because when we save our file with the .java, what appear in the screen is another name. For example if the programmer save the file as MyFile.java, the name that appears in the screen is MyFi~1.jav, so he will compile it with "javac MyFi~1.jav" because this is file that show in the screen. In this section, I think the way that presented by the book "Teach yourself JAVA in 21 days" is better. I hope that the authors can take note about it and have a great improvement in the next book. Finally I would like to say this is a good book but a perfect one !$LABEL$1,0,-100

Fascinating Read.... I was actually taken aback after reading this. A very difficult book to discredit as the writing within these pages are too 'real' and very much sing some kind of truth. Venomous ? The author would not have any real motive to exaggerate or dress up any story but tell it like it is as they say in NYC ! I read this really quickly and I couldn't put it down when I started. The actual read itself is like watching film footage it's that real sounding. Fred ? I believe him... However it was a long time ago, people can and often do change. The principal point is that there are disturbed people on the loose out there with easy access to weapons and a warped bonding with fame which terrifies some high profile celebs etc. The book for me concludes that no-one won in the end, but even then, the fans (shortened term for fanatic I might add!)continue to haunt Yoko at times.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Angry book by an angry man. I hated this book. I wanted to read it because a have a couple of family members with addiction problems who recovered on their own without AA. The author's style of writing is terrible and I think his story could have been told just as well without the choppy sentences and probably a record number of F words in any book I have ever read. I also don't beleive the story of the dental procedures done without any novocane. Sounds like something from "Marathon Man". If he had had a ruptured appendix, would they have removed it without any anesthesia? A person can go into shock from pain and I have never heard of the use of novocane triggering any relapse in an addict. After all, it is injected into the nerve, not the bloodstream.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Time for Metallica to retire.. I would like to say that I used to be a huge Metallica fan. Kea, Rtl, MoP, AJfA were amazing albums. Even the black album had it's moments. I was hoping that this record would return the band to it former glory (for me anyway). I was wrong. The album sounds like a demo and the engineering is horrible. Also, I dont know what Lars was trying to do with his drumming. There is an effect on the snare drum that is not only annoying, but down right distracting. They lyrics and choruses are also sub par. However, the guitars on this album are great. Very kill em all , old school metal sounding. Buttom line is that it is time for Metallica to retire.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Admirable attempt. This game has a decent premise, let the player run free while doing jobs for different factions. True, it's been done before, but never in a location such as this, everyone adds their own little tweaks. my biggest gripe with this game is that it looks horrible! i have a fairly nice gaming rig, athlon64 3700, 1gig corsair xms memory, geforce 7600 OC, as you can see, this rig isn't a puppy, i can run F.E.A.R, doom 3,far cry, half life 2, and oblivion at mid/high to high settings with almost no slowdown, this game looks like Morrowind and still slows down. The other thing is the voice acting, in the cinematics, it's ok, but in the actualy game itself, it sounds terrible. it's a game they could have done so much with, but for one reason or another, they didn't/couldn't. well, you all know how atari's been doing lately, and perhaps games like this are the result, or the cause.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Brilliant and gripping. As always, author Daniel Silva has crafted a compelling story in THE CONFESSOR, bravely tackling a topic that is bound to be controversial.THE CONFESSOR again displays the careful and scholarly research that Silva's works always evidence. While the book is fiction, it is completely fact-based.Here, he has constructed a fictional tale revolving around a significant contrast. He distinguishes between the phony assistance that the Vatican pretended to the world to be giving, albeit passively, to the Jews of Europe during World War II and the active, but hidden, way in which the Church actually supported the Nazis.He examines the scholarly evidence in this murder mystery set in the present day. His story is gripping and compelling, so much so that a reader cannot wait to turn the next page.THE CONFESSOR proves that Daniel Silva must be included in any current list of that group of leading authors of thrillers.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A great satire made by a great performance by Rachel Weisz. Fantastic satire about the minefield of relationships that really makes you think about the people around you. Rachel Weisz proves once again to be the best versatile actress we have around with a powerful performance that seduces as well as scares the willies out of you. She makes this film hands down with her talent and she will have you talking with your partner well after the film is over. The rest of the cast is just as great with Paul Rudd giving a great transformation on screen from geek to hunk.

A great subwoofer. We have a basic extensive system set up with a Yamaha HTR-5760 7.1 receiver, 2 x E90 towers, EC25 center channel, and a pair of E30 rear speakers.

I cannot think of a better sub for the price on the market. It truly carries a great smooth sound not found in smaller subwoofers, and is easily capable of pressurizing standard size rooms.

Very Good !! must see movie. I picked this movie up at my local library last week and very much enjoyed it. I watched the movie, the extras, and the movie with commentary and enjoyed and learned from almost everything.This movie has such a clear explanation of the crisis of global warming and even why we have been so ignorant to it for all these years.One of the parts of this film that touched me personally was how some of the stars of the film have dealt with the struggle of getting the goverment to take action on global warming and how they deal with the thought of a possible loss. This film and another documentary on pbs helped me deal with my own frustrations about global warming and goverment inaction.P.S.

A Triumph. "An excellent book! A thorough, lively interpretation of how Europe got to where it is today and the struggles Europeans had to overcome, sometimes with US help but often in defiance of the USA. In addition to being well-researched, Hitchcock illuminates his themes with very telling details from everyday life and biographies of overlooked historical figures that inform his thesis. A brisk, well-informed counter to the usual Europe-bashing in today's media. Highly recommended."$LABEL$1,0,-100

Metrowerks was kind enough to send me version 4.0, however, and promises to re-introduce OS X Pascal support at a later date.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Do not forget what was left out of Live at Luther College. As a devoted DMB fan, I have to admit Everyday has a tendency to make one apprehensive about the new edge to the band. However, after sinking into the music it is clear that the creative abilities of the band are alive and well. This studio release does not possess the standard acoustic guitar, sax, violin, base, and drum sound accustomed in their preceding albums. But, neither did Live at Luther College. DMB is making some personal musical breakthroughs with this latest effort, listening to the lyrics, chords, and instruments it is clear that the best is yet to come. Buy this album, imagine what it will sound like live with an acoustic guitar and enjoy.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Radical is one thing, freakish is another. I admire Marc Minkowski and his excellent Louvre ensemble, but what was he thinking here? Except for a few numbers taken slower thn usual, his tempos race madly, to the point of freahishness. If you don't know what you're getting in for, every number will make you blink tiwce--it doesn't seem conceivable that a good musician would commit this kind of bizarre distortion on Handel, even in the name of authenticity. I guess the amazon reviewer considers 'radical' a word of praise, but not in this case. It's a shame that Minkowski's chorus and soloists are generally superior since they are asked to sing while chasing after a fire truck.I doubt that my opinion will be popular here, but newcomers might welcome the warning. To my ears, this Messiah is unlistenable.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Warning to ordinary readers!. I am writing this review because I wish I had read one like it before I bought this book. The only reason to read this book is if your religious or other beliefs prevent you from reading a real thriller (such as one written by Thomas Perry or James W. Hall): one with well-drawn characters, realistic dialog, a plot-line free of contradictions, professionally edited, tighly written and with no glaring grammatical mistakes. If you don't care about those things, and if you can't abide even a hint of sex, profanity or bloodshed, and if you like to read about people praying every five pages, then this book is for you. And don't be misled (like I was) by the high reader rating - it's pretty obvious that most of them were planted.$LABEL$0,0,-100

The Best Book on Characterization Ever Written!. This book was given to me on my birthday over twenty-seven years ago. I glanced at it briefly, and since that time it sat on my bookshelf gathering dust. What a mistake. Just the other day I was having some trouble with a story character, and piled it up with some others covering the same subject for later use. What a gold mine of incisive instruction! I can't put it down. Although written in 1942 (ironically the year of my birth), absolutely everything Ms. Elwood presents today is right on target.

Audio book by Nathaniel Parker: Charlie Higson: Blood Fever. Listening to any audio book read by Nathaniel Parker is always a joy. This Young Bond story turns out quite sinister including lots of killings of more or less innocent people (which to my knowledge is the tendency of the adult James Bond stories,too). The plot is altogether clever, compelling and surprising to the very end. The story starts with an idyllic scene in the Greek archipelago and gets soon to Eton College from where some boys and teachers James Bond including travel for the summer holiday to the island of Sardinia and get involved with art thieves, pirates and bandits. The course of events is directed by the local rich lunatic who naturally wants even more power over other people and helds as a prisoner the compulsory young beautiful English girl for James Bond to rescue.Nathaniel Parker as the reader makes this story even more live and exciting by his marvelous characterizations and strong empathizing with the interpretation.$LABEL$1,0,-100

NOT as advertised in picture and NOT worth 50 dollars. One would assume that if you are going to spend fifty dollars on a spice rack, there would be no skimping on quality. The picture and descriptions of this item would have you believe that the spice holders themselves would be stainless steel or some form of at least aluminum. They even add a nice metallic sheen in the picture. In addition, you would think that with fifty dollars they would make the core glass or at least a strong composite. The shakers clear area is a cheap plastic. The stand itself appears durable but the shaker color does not match the stainless steel stand or my other stainless appliances. It actually looks cheap next to them. I would not recommend this product and will likely return this item. Positives include a strong base and magnets that work.

A Joycean discourse on the tribulations of Black America.. Louis Edwards, in the esteemed tradition of Joyce, Wolff and John Edgar Wideman, delivers a tour de force in his first novel "Ten Seconds". With remarkably swift yet extremely provocative prose, Edwards recounts the life of a young African-American man attempting to ground his identity in the south. Using a Joycean technique, in terms of the cyclical structure of the novel (based on ten seconds of a 100 meter race), Edwards captivates the reader from page one. Once you pick this, you will not put it down until it is over. Wonderful!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Less than zero. Too bad I could not rate this book a zero because it screams for it! To say I was disappointed is a gross understatement. I read the reviews from many readers and really expected a good read but in my opinion this book lacked everything I look for in Vampire Eroticism/Romance. The characters were dead-on one dimensional. There was no definable tension between Domini and Alec, no suspense within the story, and certainly no anticipation leading into the sex which, let's face it, all Vampire addicts crave and expect. And really, what was up with that Indiana Jones hat??? That was a real turn off for me. A Vampire with a fedora? Ick!

ViaVoice Mac OS X doesn't work beyond 10.3.5. I recently purchased ViaVoice MAC OS X because I had used the OS 9 version and liked it. When I up-graded to a new G4 Powerbook running OS 10.3.7, I purchased the new version so that it would work with OS X. After installing it and going through the training, I found that I could not use it, because it kept unexpectedly quiting when I tried to launch Speakpad. I called Scansoft and was informed that it only works with 10.3.5 or below. I have searched many descriptions of the product and no mention of this was found.

A great idea for a book, but messed up by authors' poor job. A great idea for a book, but the book is messed up by the authors' silliness and self-indulgence. Had the authors just dealt with their topic, it would be five stars. Instead,the book suffers from two major problems. First, almost every paragraph is replete with childish "inside" jokes, sophomoric asides (invariably Lefist where they are politifal), imbecilic puns and similar self-indulgent stupidity, apparently included to show how clever the authors are. Instead, all this junk just distracts from any discussion and generally leaves the reader grinding his teeth in annoyance. Second, there are serious and repeated errors in the descriptions of the movie plots. Did the authors actually watch all the films discussed, or did they rely on others (grad students, perhaps?) for some of the material? My conclusion is that the topic is well worth a book, and its a shame the authors made such a mess of this one.$LABEL$0,0,-100

BE FORWARNED. Remember before you even think of buying this book that there are a few prerequisites before you can even think of getting started. 1.) The required excercises must be done in a gym. 2.) You need 20 minutes 3 days a week, and 45 minutes 3 days a week for the excercises. 3.) The program relies heavily on supplements which happen to be manufactured by the author's former employer. So besides the investment of the book (Which you don't even need because all the info is free on the web site for free), you need a gym membership and a budget for supplements.

You will probably not find this review helpful. Ok, so call me shallow, but I guess I tried to watch this movie a couple years ago, and I found it again the other day on my DVD shelf. I could not figure out how it got there or why I didn't remember much of it. Well, I figured it out pretty quickly. The female lead looks like she forgot to take off ghoul makeup and put on wrinkle cream or any other makeup. I mean seriously she looks so weathered that it pretty much ruins the movie, which otherwise is generally entertaining.

WORST FILM I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. Really, this is the worst film I've seen in years. I had expected a quality film from Julia Roberts, but this film distorts, changes (for the worst) and ruins the classical Snow White story most of us are familiar with. It's too scary for children, and yet the film was probably made for audiences under 10 years old.

Goldsmith Borrows A Little from Himself. With a career spanning over four decades, Goldsmith has attained a position as one of the movie's most prolific and innovative composers. Although his work during the past ten years does not compare to his landmark work of the 60's and 70's, he did do two exemplary scores in the 90's: one is the music to "The Ghost in the Darkness" and "Total Recall."What makes "Recall" such a winner is that it seems to pay homage to Goldsmith's earlier triumphs. One can hear "The Omen," "Planet of the Apes," the underrated "Secret of N.I.M.H" and even "Gremlins" in the otherworldly melodies used to complement the film. There is much originality in this composition with the opening and closing themes being especially awesome in their execution. But it is the patented Goldsmith "touches" that make this one significant and a worthy, albeit unintended, "introduction" for those who are just discovering the composer.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Close but no Ceegar!. This is the second rack purchased from Kingwin and I am disappointed. The tiny fan is way too noisy, and the system is not swappable without turning off the computer, even though it has a key to turn off power and unlock the tray.With external drives in general, all you need to do is either use the Safe remove in the oS or simly unplug the power. The drive stops and the reference in My Computer disappears. But with the Kingwin, using the key to turn off power does not provide this functionality. In fact, if you do so, you must reboot anyway, and it will involve a hard reboot, as the OS is stuck looking for this drive in an endless loop for reboot. You can go ahead and pull the drive, it is shut off, but the icon for it does not disappear from Computer, as does externals do.I'll likely look for a true hot swappable enclosure.Win 7 64 bit, AMD system 12G memory.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I Didn't Understand, So I watched it again. I first watched the movie on PBS. I didn't fully understand who some of the characters were and how they fit into the picture. I bought the movie so that I could watch it again. I now understand what was going on. I know things back then are not the way they are now, except the fact that most of the time money is everything. How did we get from there to here? Some standards have gone down the trash. The ladies and gentlemen all talk so proper. Lizzie is so stubborn. But her mother got to me the most. I found her nagging voice very irritating and the way she could change her opinion of other people so quickly so she does not look stupid to her family and friends. Mr.Darcy is proof that you can change the first impression you give other people. But it also helps you to see that if you never tell anyone how you feel, how will you ever know how they feel. And most of all I did get that warm and tinglely feeling at the end of the movie.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A Very Good Summary. A little smart-alecky for its own good sometimes, and sometimes drawing some probably unfair conclusions, this book is still the best summary of all the Clinton scandals until 1998. And oh my, were there a lot of meat to those scandals. It's a startling reminder of just how much substantiated fact was involved with the Clinton allegations compared to the allegations that the left just can't seem to make stick on Bush.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Belkins TuneCast II isn't worth it.. I was looking for an fm tuner to use in my car for going down the highway. i'm not rich and this one was the cheapest i could use with my new Sansa Clip. but only to find out that i GOT cheap. all i got was static when i tried to use it in the car and home sterio. the range (according to Belkin.com) is 10 to 30 ft. with 10 or less being optimal. so i went to their web site and looked up the best options to tune the radio to (like the directions say) only to find that even with the transmitter sitting ON TOP OF the sterio (clearly less than 10 feet away) all i got was static with a very slight hint of music. and the worst thing is i'm not even from a town with heavy fm signals. i tried high, i tried low, and even in the middle of the fm band and got static. ok, yeah, some where better than others but none were even remotely close to being listenable.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great Product, Watch Your Seller. I got this item in great shape - no rust etc, X-Acto quality, but - Be careful where you buy this.

Cute-looking, but totally unreliable. Just like another commenter, my 'cute' Canon tortured me by sometimes showing a blinking 'H' after removing a roll a film.

if you need POTS only. We've got a Step 2 kitchen from our friends with TONS of extra stuff, but the two pots (the ones which actually make sounds) were missing.I searched on-line and found that for the set Amazon has the best price, however, if you only need Pot and Frying pan, as we do, go to Step2 replacement parts, they are 3 times cheaper than the whole set.

Better than I was expecting. I was introduced to Alizee through World of Warcraft. My nephew showed me a video with all of the dances, and Jen ai Marre was the song playing in the background for one of them. I really fell in love with the song, and saw the CD here. I decided to pick it up.Needless to say, I really dig this CD. While there are some perennial favorites for me, the whole thing is really enjoyable.

Save Your Money.... I wanted so much to like this, such a great idea. I agree with other reviews, you cannot fit an"assembled" sandwich in the bottom, it is too shallow.

Not Impressed with the new version.. I've had the older version (11B) for over a year and have never had a problem.

And just this week the built in mic stopped working. All I hear is static. I love the linksys wireless products and have spent a lot of money with them.

Poor Customer Service & A Great Program Ruined. I don't own this version but I have used it and it has deteriorated greatly over the years. Canvas 3.5 was the best and Canvas 5.0 wasn't bad but Canvas 8 had quite a few problems on the mac including a windows type interface and stability problems. After Deneba sold it to ACD, it went down hill fast. Deneba had great customer service and support but ACD was lousy in this area and they raised the price significantly. ACD kept sending me offers to buy the windows version (I have bought 5 different mac versions) when I sent them an email asking about a fourth coming mac version they would not even answer the email.

My two cent. I've had my Slick U212 since about 1988, my first and only tripod. Bought it used from a amateur photo shoot buddy. His thing was the Leica R4, If I remember correctly, while mine was the Olympus OM4 SLR.Haven't used my U212 much since the days of photo shoots. Currently looking around to supplement the U212 with a ball head by Bogen Monfrotto and a binocular adaptor. Lots of searching and thinking with adaptors and bushings because Monfrotto is threaded for 3/8" while the U212 is 1/4".All this tinkering just to find all that is really needed is the binocular adaptor and perhaps some spare quick shoes for the U212. The Slick Universal U212 really is universal.The U212 is not the lightest, strongest, or flexible (head swapping) unit available. If your needs for a tripod are general and non specific the U212 has proven over the years to be exceptional.$LABEL$1,0,-100

However, if I had to pick my favorite - I pick Alice and her piano on "Northern Star" - true honesty and grace as well as strong passion. My other favorites would have to be "Some Things Get Lost" (she has a great voice for ballads) and "Parallel Life".

Five stars, for Erin Grey, not Gil Gerard. The price of this DVD set can not be beat. If you are a fan of this series and you want to watch these episodes again, you won't go wrong in getting this.But as I watched the shows, it was Erin Grey who really stood out. After watching a handful I predicted what Buck would do. Gil Gerard must have had a "kick" clause in his contract because that's all this guy did in every episode. Season one of course was much better. There's only thirteen episodes in season two, which meant it was thirteen too many.The guest stars here really stood out and that's why I am glad I own this.

Ridiculous. Are people comparing this to Oldboy? Oldboy was flabbergasting. It delivers an invisible slap of surprise on the watcher's face. Mr. Vengeance fails miserably at creating any sort of effect whatsoever. The storyline is a bit challenged, if you ask me. There is no real feeling of revenge and most of the time the screenplay with characters coming in and going out creates confusion. It took me a while to understand what's actually going on. I watched this 40 days back and can't even recall what happens in the end. What's even more confusing is that I've known to have a prodigious memory of mind, or atleast I claim to.In any case, absolute bollocks of a movie watching experience. Avoid.$LABEL$0,0,-100
size information not in online description. I purchased the fannypacks for my 5 and 3 year old grandchildren. Since they are called "kids," I thought that they would be child-size. However, when they arrived I discovered that they are made for adolescents, requiring the belt to be shortened several inches for our family's use. In fact, the tag says "intended for children 8 and over." It would have been helpful if that information had been included in the online description.

Bravo. I love this DVD! It is recorded at the end of a tour. They are home in Seattle and the band is very tight. They appear to be happy to be home and they put a great show for the home audiance. There personalities really come through on this dvd. Ann and Nancy Wilson prove that they are two of the best female performers on the planet. Ann's voice sounds great on classics like "Alone". Nancy's shows off her guitar playing on songs like "Love Alive". They play all the classics and in the middle of the concert Ann and Namcy do an acoustic set which ends with a great Elton John cover of "Mona Lisa and Mad Hatters". Their vocal harmonies are like ear candy. The whole band sounds great. They have gotten better with age and have work hard to master their craft. Their covers of Led Zepplin are outstanding. They have stood the test of time. I highly recommend this dvd!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great purchase will be better the second time. OK, I'm a white collar guy who just wanted an alternative to jeans to play outside with my kids and then head to the store with my wife without changing. This was a completely blind purchase and these are perfect. Took them to the mountains and rode the sled in the snow and also horseback all day. They did not soak like jeans or get me cold. I live in the desert and can wear them in the warm weather. Very tough and better looking than any jeans. BUT pay heed to the reviews. Put your vanity aside and order an extra inch on the waist; they are tighter and less stretchy than your jeans. My second pair will be even better now that I know that.Cheers.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A Fusion Classic. This album is Brand X at their best. Many would say that Mahavishnu's Inner Mounting Flame was the quintessential fusion album, but I'd say this one delivers stiff competition. Lumley's flowing melodies soar in front of Goodsall's intricate picked (not strummed) rhythms and Jones' innovative bass lines. If that's not enough, Phil Collins does his best work ever on the drums right here. There's no comparision to his work in Genesis -- who knew the guy could play this well?

MPS5280. I found this book in our adoption agency and had to buy it. I like the fact that it's easy to read and that it mentions high level milestones for my son. While I didn't give birth, I think it gives common sense advice to mom's about recovery and the relationship advice is true whether you adopt or give birth. If you are looking for a very detailed book, this is not the one, but for something high level (believe me, I have Dr. Sears book and several other's that I think are way too much to read during the first few months). Not to mention in those books, my son who was born 4 weeks early may or may not fit the timeframe. This book makes it easier to relate to since it's my month and if he doesn't fit the timeframe, it's high level enough to know it's okay if he's not reached that milestone yet. I recommend this book for new parents and as a shower/baby gift.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Unfortunately there are only four books right now, but we can only hope that she is as prolific as she is gifted. Her characters are so well drawn out you can actually remember them.

new feature. I've been using Petmate water fountains for a few years now, tending to get a couple of years of use out of them. For the price, the amount of use (two cats) and hair I'm usually cleaning out of the pump, it seems reasonable to me. I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow, is usually quiet (unless there's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir) and the cats have no problem drinking from it. Those are its pros, along with its price (much better than the version that the vet pushes). However, I've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning, which cost it a star (not sure if it'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so).$LABEL$1,0,-100

Works Like It Should. Added this valve to my new shower head and it works well. The package includes an o-ring which I initially installed with the valve. Using teflon tape there was a small leak at that joint, so I removed the valve, took out the o-ring, added a bit more tape and now the joint is leak free. I see no need for the o-ring.

The computers in the lab print to these, and because we run a network and the printer can two, every classroom and can print to the lab printers. The printer is very versatile with 2 or 3 automatic bays for paper and 2 manual entry paper bays for large papers or envelopes and such. It prints extremely fast, but takes about 5 minutes to warm up in the morning, or 2 minutes to warm up if it hasn't been used in a couple hours.

Apparently so for this machine. It looks cool and the carafe feels heavy and high quality, but the coffee is really weak and awful. I have been putting in 2-3 extra scoops of grounds and I still don't like the coffee. Now, I feel like I'm just throwing good money after bad by wasting all that extra coffee grounds. Plus, the warming plate keeps the coffee way too hot and it tastes burned within 15 minutes or so. I figured out why the coffee is so weak - the hot water only sprays out of one little hole onto the grounds - my previous Krups had about 6 little holes to "shower" the coffee grounds. I wish I could return this Braun - I will give it away and buy either another Krups or a Cuisinart.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Marry Me Gwen Stefani!. I think that at this point in No Doubts career, it was high time for them to produce an disc with all of their singles. My favorite cut on this is the high octane bombast of "New". I love the over processed drums, the 80s style keyboards, and everything about the song. Another highlight is "Hella Good," which is from the rock steady album. Over all, I believe that this is an album thats all about change, as is the band. They have gone from scrappy kids who like Ska, to neo New wavers in 10 years. They have a way of paying homage to their influences, while claiming the styles for their own in a way that no other band is capable of. the only thing that would make it better is if this record was sequenced chronologically, either in correct, or reverse order, so the listener could take the journey with the band, instead of having it scattered around.$LABEL$1,0,-100
There is better. I thought this book would help me learn Java when I first bought it, but I think the examples are skimpy. A more complete reference and tutorial is Cay Horstman's and Gary Cornell's 7 ed. of Core Java 2: Volumes 1 and 2. These 2 volumes have great examples, and go more in-depth into Java. Skip Schildt's book, and buy the Core Java Volumes even if you need just a reference. You will be happier, and learn more.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Butz: A Pathological Liar. This author has some nerve trying to rewrite history. Most of my grandmother's family was murdered by the Nazis. To compound this tragedy by denying that 6 million Jews were killed is a further atrocity. The fact that anyone can believe this crap is alarming. The Holocaust DID happen. If you don't believe it, go to any Holocaust memorial (Washington, DC, etc) and see the documentation and photographs for yourself. Also, Yad Vashem (a memorial in Israel) may have a website.

Below average. I bought this laptop a year ago. When it reached, it came with a faulty DVD ROM drive. I had to take DVD ROM out myself and send it back to HP and after they recieved it, they sent me a new DVD ROM which worked well.Couple of months later, the LCD screen won't stay upright and it became loose. So, this time I had to send whole laptop back to HP.I had a tough time with their customer care service. Everytime (5 times) I called them they have tradition of putting me on hold of minimum of 20 mins with breaks of "Sir, Please hold on, I will be with you shortly. I am trying to pull out your record" after every 5 minutesJust yesterday the battery died.I am sure I could have found better laptop had I spent some more time searching.Think twice before buying this.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great idea, poor design. This started out as a great little item. I ended up returning it the first time I had to replace the batteries (about 2 months later). Once the old batteries were removed, everything was reset, and I had to reset the time, month, year, and even had to re-calibrate the compass. What a pain, and not worth the money. If I only had to reset the calendar, that would be fine, but having to re-calibrate the compass is a pain.$LABEL$0,0,-100
great if lasted. I got it about a year 6 month ago. Used it very lightly - 10 times perhaps and the rest of the time it was either in my garage or in my car. When I got it out for a next shoot I noticed that quite a bit of grease leaked out out of head. Good thing it did not ruin anything else, since it was pretty sticky. It still works at the moment, but once grease is gone its days are numbered. This is by far the least amount of use I have ever gotten out of a head.Other than that it is a bit heavy for the specs. I guess this is what you get for not going with a reputable brand... It is amazing how many times I have to relearn this simple fact.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Disappointed!. This was a painful read. I bought this and Glasshouse together to read while recovering from surgery. Thankfully, I had also purchased some other titles because after forcing myself to finish Accelerando I could not bring myself to even start Glasshouse.I enjoy when an author creates their own vocabulary to express new concepts but Stross takes this practice to an uncomfortable extreme. The number of new concepts being presented along with their associated descriptors was disorienting and hard to follow. Somewhere around the middle of the book, I decided to stop trying to understand the details and just focused on finishing the larger story. I was disappointed again. The End did not justify the means.My opinion: Accelerando as a destination is not worth the journey.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Just one minor criticism. Archer tells us about Whitechapel at the time of World War I.

Mr. Who or What!. I am so Thankful this film came on Sundance for had it not I would have made the error in buying it for my collection. Really there was what could have been a "real story" here but that did not happend. Instead the director took this film on what seemed to be a if you will "trip". It went here, there, everywhere, leaving you saying what the heck is this so called film I'm watching. Then the so called female friend still doesn't know the difference between a gay man & a straight man with all the gay men she is surrounded by. Please if "anything" rent this film do not buy it. If someone elese were to take and rewrite this script it would be a great story and done without spending a ton of money as well. Simply the director failed at telling any kind of story here. If your bored or a lazy Sunday afternoon take a peak but remember even if it's a lazy afternoon you can not get back the lazy time you gave up by watching this film.Peace & Blesssings,Hope This Helps someone from buying.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great song on a crap album. The rating is for the entire album. I almost gave it one star, but "Crazy" is the catchiest thing I've heard in over a year & deserves much better supporting material than the junk on here. I'm so disappointed...I really wanted to find some hidden gem, but after having it play constantly in my car for the last week, nothing as yet has jumped out of my speakers.It's called inspiration flowed for three minutes & needed some filler to justify a cd length release. A lot of the lyrics for other songs are creepy (but not in any cathartic good way.) And the beats (sans Crazy)are pretty lame too. I borrowed my roommates copy & sure am glad I didn't spend my own 10 bucks.Not many people are able to make an album that's consistently good beginning to end.

Highly Recommended. What a great book! All you need to know about your horse's muscles, why you need to stretch and in what situations, is in this book. I have never come across something quite so comprehensive and easy to understand in one book before. It has wonderful big glossy colour pictures, spiral bound for easy page turning as well as being able to keep it open on the page you want while trying out some exercises on your horse.I did several relevant stretch exercises on my horse's sore back end, and within a week he was helping to stretch himself and really seemed to enjoy it, closing his eyes, relaxing and wiggling his lips. His lunging work has also become easier as he has become more supple.I especially recommend this book for anyone doing competition work with their horses, as they can become quite tense in certain areas and this book helps to explain and show you how to release the tension. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Basic start reading for the begginer. This book is both a begginer's obligatory reading and a consultation source for the practising lawyer dealing with antitrust issues. It is also quoted in many foreign books about the subject, for example "Os fundamentos do Antitruste" written by a Brazilian professor (Dr. Paula A.

Constantly changing features on DVDs. Stargate is a great Sci-Fi show, but you probably know that already or you wouldn't be reading a review of Season 3's DVD.I'm a little disappointed that they continue to experiment with the special features on the DVDs. Each disk of Season 2 included the trailers for the shows on that disk. Very nice - we would watch the previews before actually watching the shows. Season 3 does not have that feature - no trailers to be found.As this is a television series that spans many seasons, we were expecting more continuity between each season's DVDs. Not that they would add something, take it away and maybe they will add it back in a later season.Other than that - I would highly recommend the series and the purchase of Season 3.$LABEL$1,0,-100

This Book is New York.. This Book is New York. Some say it's the city's foundation. Sure,... it may be on paper, but so what. It's still New York. Take it or leave it. It's just a fact. Some say it's New York dirt. But that's what makes it so worth reading. It shows a side of the city that some New Yorkers may not know or remember. This is why it's worth your time. Similar to certain films being a love story about the city itself (Manhattan (1979), When Harry Met Sally (1989) and You've Got Mail (1998)) this book also goes with other great books about the city, including two recent ones called "Through The Children's Gate" (2006) & "Seven At The Sevens (2012).

Modern Hollywood can't make a 5 star comedy - UNTIL NOW. I thought it couldn't be done. This is not the era of Lloyd, or Fields or Laurel and Hardy. It's not the era of Capra or Preston. 99% of modern comedies suck badly, and or are mean spirited.But miracle of miracles, someone current, finally made an hilarious movie with a heart as big as "You Can't Take it With You!"Credit here goes not to the very good cast but stunningly to the writer/directors: Michael Arndt - Screenwriter, co directed by Jonathan Dayton & Valerie Faris.Brilliant, and wise. Not just a movie about dysfunctional, it's a movie where looser are shown to be the winners they really are, just for surviving, like all of us. Not a moment of saccharine either.

Big Disappointment. I have read many of Miss Thompson's books and liked most of them. I read this book in the Kindle version, and I don't know what happened to it. The mistakes were so many that I kept asking myself why I kept on reading. Typos, misplaced sentence parts, and flat out wrong words just jump out at me. The story did hold me for a while. But then I had more than a third to go and just got tired of the distruction and human suffering.

Poor quality controll with no Manufacture support. The First Aid [2.0] kit I received was of poor quality. The right seam on hte left inside pocket was only sewn 1/2 way to the bottom. See Pics posted. Needle holes could be seen in the plastic and I called the manufacture who confirmed the pocket should be sewn all the way. I asked them If they would support their product and they would not. This was clearly a manufacturing defect and the Manufacture (or should I say importer) told me they could not help me and to return it to where I bought it from.

Solid Entertainment. I saw bad reviews for this movie, and those reviews made me want to see "The Bourne Legacy" because they were along the lines of, "It's too slow, too much character development." And that's exactly what I want in a movie like this! Jeremy Renner is excellent as the lead character, and ably supported by the wonderful Rachel Weisz. Then you throw Ed Norton in the mix and you have a riveting and intriguing action/spy/thriller that raises a lot of question about boundaries, both political and philosophical, and leaves you longing for more.It's very much a Bourne movie, but with better camera work (yes, the last two Matt Damon ones left me a little nauseous from the "realistic" camera shake).

It's OK, not great. It's very tough to find a decent soaker hose, at any cost. Swan is downright terrible and the company doesn't respond.

HORRIBLE, DOES NOT REPRESENT VIEW OF MOST CHRISTIANS. Horrified is the key word here. I am horrified at Andrews' views so much that this is the first book for which I am writing a review. I am a born again Christian, I know my bible and love the Lord but and am sickened by Christians who take this viewpoint, and sad to think that other people think this is how Christians operate. Andrews' advice to a friend about his daughter, and the description of him and a male teacher "FORCING" a 6th grade boy to submit to corporal punishment 2 or 3 times in a row, then each time forcing the boy to put his arms around Andrews' neck to hug him back, is SICK. MY ADVICE IS - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. I cringe at Christians like this, and feel very sorry for their families and the people who are influenced by or affected by their viewpoints. The only reason I gave this book one star is because I couldn't give it zero or minus stars. Andrews made a few good points but there have to be better books out there.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A thick thinker, intriguing. This is a very interesting book, but people looking for an easy read with simply-constructed theses should look elsewhere. Pinchbeck approaches his writing as serious science and the text is thick with philosophy, psychology and more.The theories advanced by Pinchbeck are mostly collected theories of others who came before him, enhanced by his own experiences with psychodelics. Some of it will be scoffed at by people who have made up their minds about the way things are and Pinchbeck both acknowledges this and expects it.Early in the book, he turns these people on their heads and sweeps them aside, inviting the curious and those readers with a will to think about things beyond the way they have been explained, beyond the way we are most comfortable with, to read on.Do I buy what Pinchbeck is selling? Some of it, sure. Some of it seems a stretch, but some of it is intriguing. Don't buy this book looking for alternative answers, buy it if you're looking for a thinker.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Don't Bother. I really wanted to like this book; the plot sounded interesting, and it started off okay, but the more I read it, the worse it got. The plot became highly predictable, the writing is atrocious, and the ending punchless. Mr. Dirgo is obviously a Clive Cussler wannabe, but has neither the imagination or story-telling ability (not to mention basic grasp of the English language) to even be mentioned in the same breath as Cussler. To make it to the plodding end of this book requires a lot of patience and a high tolerance for baseless dialogue.$LABEL$0,0,-100
disappointing series. I have read all 4 books in this series and I would not recommend them to anyone. I am 36 yrs old and this series is for the young adult crowd so maybe I am too old to enjoy it. I found the main character Bella so annoying I had a hard time reading the books. The story took a strange direction in the last book (I thought way too out there for teens). I read the books because I saw a preview for the Twilight movie which I hope is not as bad as the books. I recommend checking them out from your local library before you waste your money.

Beautiful. What the heck is wrong with North American radio? I know...it's a rhetorical question but one that needs to be asked. Especially when it ignores wonderful albums like H.M.S. Fable. This is dense, fluid, passionate music rich in melodies, potent in vocals and song-writing. And, it's by yet another ignored Britpop band. There seems to be no stomach for bands like this one, Shed Seven, Cast, etc. in Canada and the U.S. And, it takes a huge label push to make Travis a "hit" here as well. More fool us. This is yet another album I recommend to people who think rock is dead. No way, No how. Michael Head is a superb writer and performer and the group scores on each of the album's 12 cuts. Check out "Comedy" in particular. It'll remind you of The Beatles, The Byrds, The Moody Blues and more sixties acts. Yet it has a bold, modern sound that hooks the listener in effortlessly and wonderfully. Superb music-making.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The binding breaks as soon as you open them. Whoever decided that this "mini" CubeBook would be a great idea must have been on some weird, mind(IQ)-altering drugs. I'm sending them back immediately. They are useless. The original version is wonderful though. I'd give this tiny version zero stars if I could.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Warning!!! This book will damage you and your family from healing!!. As a psychotherapist, I assure you that reparative therapy is not only an ineffective and unethical practice, but also damaging to the soul and self of your loved one. Acceptance is what you and your family needs. The American Psychological Association has deemed reparative therapy unethical practice, and the author of this book, provided he is utilizing this therapy with clients, could and should lose his license to practice. There are many other books available on Amazon.com that can help (What the Bible Really Says About HomosexualityorPositively Gay: New Approaches to Gay and Lesbian Life), but this is not one of them!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Loved It Until It Died!. After two months of use, one day the computer stopped recognizing the drive. I called Seagate, spent an hour on the phone troubleshooting with them only to learn that the drive is basically dead. My company's IT dept. confirmed this.When I called warranty service, Seagate said the warranty had expired. I told them the drive was only a few months and there is a one-year warranty so how could the warranty have expired? Very frustrating so now I have to send all kinds of proof for a product that was a gift, pretty challenging. Also their service center is in India so you get occassional bad phone connections and some difficulty communicating.More than anything, the massive loss of data is really, really bad. I got a quote from them to recover the data: $1,400. I don't have that kind of money to get my data back.Buyer Beware.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Once captured, you can use Adobe Premiere or the editing program of your choice.Also, the included Ulead and Main Actor editing software is used by many and far from freebie 'junk.'

It Could Have Been Better. Shirley Bassey was voted the best female vocalist in the last 50 years, and most of her recordings reflect that. However, this CD is the exception. I don't know if she was just having a bad day, but every song seems to be a struggle for her, and knowing Bassey, there was no reason to struggle! The only song on this CD that she manages to give the "Bassey treatment" to is "As If We Never Said Goodbye", and even it could have been better. The rest are hard to listen to.

INTELLIGENT, BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. I must admit I am not a techno/trance fan, but a friend of mine made me listen to this album and I was awe-struck.

About as Compelling as Me Finishing This Title. I managed to find out that this book wasn't expensive or even rare, as it seems to be. It's just obscure and negligent, and for once, I wish it would be kept that way. The sum of this hundred page book is: inconclusive. It's a theory based on looking at a few flags and thinking to yourself "Hey, these are similar." One of the ideas used to support the theory in this book is the lack of evidence in the formation of Switzerland, and then the large omission of time between that and the Swiss bankers infamous today. There is little concrete historical reality beyond a few fantasmic imaginations and a lack of true Templar scholarship. While I like to believe that some Templars survived the Inquisition, and God knows they did, there is no way, simply no way that a lack of evidence refutes and/or supports evidence.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Sub Par Silverberg, only for die-hard fans of Silverberg. I love Silverberg, he's become my favorite sci fi author by far. With that said, this book is as close to garbage Silverberg will get. What a slog just to get through it. The book should have been edited to less than 100 pages because nothing really ever happens, a whiny, flawed, racist, ex-king/future king recants old stories from his youth amidst a swirling future backdrop that is poorly built except for small snatches. Only a few worlds and technologies and cultural ideas get elaborated upon. And I found the ghosting done only by gypsies into the past and present and future to be fairly stupid and ill-conceived. Some parts were interesting but most of time I found myself saying...I think I care, I think I care, I think I care, I think I don't.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Valuable Discernment Tool. I had already read a number of more academic books about spiritual direction when I discovered Fleetwood Range's down-to-earth approach to the topic. Her wealth of experience as a spiritual director, along with her understanding of the ambivalence with which many individuals are called to this ministry, makes her book a valuable tool for discernment. By the time I finished reading it, I was able to say without hesitation, "Yes, spiritual direction is indeed where God is calling me to serve." I highly recommend her book to anyone drawn to this topic.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Why not just be truthful about the product in the description.. The listing stated that this item was an 'Official Nintendo Wii' charger. The charger they sent is clearly not.

The best word to describe this product: "Lame". I bought this as an advertized package with Elenco AmeriKit Learn to Solder Kit. I saw a review on there talking about how they wished it had a "Desoldering pump" My solder-friendly friends told me they had never heard of a "Desoldering Pump". This is likely why-a product this poor is not worth notoriety. The pump is incredibly weak, and works about 1 in 10 attempts. The only way to get enough suction to pick up the melted solder was to hit the release button, which would then kick-back, suck up some of the solder, and then smush the rest onto the pad. I recommend just using the sponge supplied in the learn to solder kit.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Potboiler, moves along but very unlikely. This is a historical naval book with a lead character much like Alistair MacLean heroes - obstinate, insubordinate, convinced he's smarter than anyone else, declamatory, and full of action. The novelist has his character speaking in little cliches to himself - in for a penny in for a pound Halfhyde! The action progresses well and the historical setting, as far as I can tell, is accurate. Battle sequences are stirring, but all in all .... The entire finish of the book hangs on a monstrous coincidence between nature starting her battle at the same time that the Japanese fire their guns. Unbelievable, and a bit too coy, also bad geology.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Definitive versions. Maazel does the best Beethoven, and he did it best when he was with the Cleveland Orchestra. These are my definitive versions of the 9th and 5th, with the 9th being particularly sublime. Every single movement he (and the singers) just nail. Perfect sound quality, wonderful recording. You can often find the individuals symphonies on single CDs, but it's nice to have them all together. The included Overtures (Egmont and Fidelio) are just OK, not my favorites by a long shot, but decent enough for a free-be. If you just need to have the nine symphonies on CD and don't want to spread them out over different conductors / orchestras, you could do a lot worse than this.$LABEL$1,0,-100

You're kidding, right?. I found a copy of "The Iron Tower" in a shoebox of books I bought at a yard sale recently. I read the back cover and was greeted with the line, "Dennis L. McKiernan's Mithgar books are among the most beloved in all of fantasy fiction." Well this book is a must read then, right? Right??Don't believe everything you read.I struggled about a third of the way into the 600 page novel before I realized this was one of the worst fantasy novels I had ever read. Never mind the derivative story; the novel itself is badly written. One of the most glaring problems is the excessive use of passive voice. While it is not techincally wrong, it comes off as amateur and hackneyed. Also, any time an author uses "lo!" in the course of his writing, and is attempting a serious tone, I cringe.

No one like them. Ever since my dad first bought their tapes in the mid- 90's, I've been listening and loving the harmony of The Winanas. I think I know every song because every song is different and you can't help but join in when they sing. The ballads, gospel that is, are so moving and the duets with Vanessa Bell and Anita Baker are wonderful. if you have never heard these men sing, you're missing something so melodious and mind blowing. I'm telling you if a kid at the age of 10 can fall in love them, then you can too. I love The Winans Music!$LABEL$1,0,-100
I have to admit that. I am a fool for once more being lured to buying a Scarpetta book. Why does Cornwell insist on writing about her? There is no more inspiration, there is no more life, there is no more hope and there is no more redemption for that once-wonderful-now-a-caricature lady. Some claim here that Cornwell returned to her former form. Don't make me laugh! She had lost everything in fiction world five years ago and she reached the zenith of silliness when she published Isle of Dogs. Now she is trying to do the same thing with the Scarpetta series, making herself a pity caricature of a once-respected author. No more Cornwell for me: Neither from the bookseller nor from the library. If you are wise enough, you will do the same.

Shame on Disney for Ruining P.L. Travers' Books!. P.L. Travers rightfully objected to the way Disney's team ruined Mary Poppins' character.

Anyone of any age who has read the books **before** seeing the movie has found this very sappy, saccharine movie very hard to digest. I know I did when I was about 8 or 9 years old.

Impressive!. How is it that the Star Trek series can spend $2 million an episode, and only come up with a halfway decent script about 10% of the time? Meanwhile, writers like Ken Wharton, working all alone, can come up with a fast, action-filled, provocative book like this one, and do it for probably less than a $10,000 advance. I don't particularly like "hard" science fiction, and I am sooo bored with authors pontificating about God, the universe, and everything. But Wharton has some genuinely fresh ideas, they're clearly written, and he's got a sizzling story to boot. I only gave it 4 stars (because I'm against grade-inflation!), but it's one of the best books I've read this year!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Sorry, But I like Her Earlier Works!. I read the first 50-60 pages and gave up. I am glad that I got this book from the library.I found it to be too convoluted, and could not find a character that I enjoyed enough to try and get through the rest of this book. I am still not clear on the cross dresser double personality thing.I love Jennifer Cruise, and have read all of her books, but I really like her earlier ones. It seems like the last couple I have read just don't quite measure up to those. She seems to be trying to top herself, and to my mind, getting so far out there that her books are no longer quite so enjoyable. I generally consider this genre to be "lighter" reading. Something to enjoy while I relax after work.In this book I could not even keep track of the characters. I just could not get into it. If you are a fan of Welcom to Temptation, Tell Me Lies, and Crazy for You, I do not think that you will enjoy this book.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Gods green Earth. What on Gods green Earth would have R.J. approve of such horrible art work? I am not convinced in the least, that the artist/s even read the WoT series. To qualify myself, I am an avid fan of RJ's work and have read the entire series 4 times now, I am sure I now know what the characters are supposed to look like. Within the covers of this illustrated guide, is perhaps the worst depiction of character resemblance I have ever SEEN!!! It turns my stomach. As an example, Lanfear is described in the series repeatedly as possibly one of the most beautiful women ever... In the Guide, she looks like a pigs behind!! Due to the poor quality of the art, I find it very difficult to even read the contents. I guess I will just have to keep waiting for Path of Daggers!!

jack. I have a 42"panasonic plasma that I decided to hang on a wall. After shopping around and educating myself with various choices I decided on the Sanus vmpl50b. Amazonas usual had a great price and I had the mount the same week on regular FREE shipping. The product is easy to install and is of excellent quality. Very heavy gauge steel.My set is about 40lbs. so it easily holds my T.V. and much more. A word of caution for Panasonic users. This mount allegedly holds up to a 56"set but my 42" just fit withnothing to spare. That is because the Panasonic mounting screws are very wide spread only a few inches from the sides.

The cartoony ghosts and ghostbusting gorila do absolutely nothing for the plot.

Also, not far from where we live here in Kansas, is the museum in Lawrence where the (badly) stuffed remains of Comanche are on exhibit.

A Trip Down Memory Lane. I remember when I was very little (can't believe I actually remember it that far), my parents bought me this album on cassette. It reminds me of both times my family and I went to Walt Disney World. I lost the cassette tape years ago, and I was surprised to find this album on CD, so I had to order it. The renditions of classic Disney songs are fantastic. Olivia Newton-John's rendition of "Part of Your World" is just beautiful. The Disney Big Band medley of "The Mickey Mouse Club" and "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" reminds me of my recent trip to WDW. And, "Remember the Magic" as sung by Brian McKnight always brings joyful tears to my eye. Highly recommended by me to any Disney fan out there. It's well worth the money.

Chilling and awakening.. This excellently researched and lucidly written dissection of the development and activities of the Psychiatric establishment was immediately a favorite.

has quality but no plot. I am not sure why I saw this movie, its not usually the kind of movie I like. I probably just was in a bad mood and wanted to see loads of pale people in dark clothes, blood, full moon and rainy streets. So far, so good. It is a well made story, though I am not sure what the story is. It is entertaining and it makes some effort with creating an appropriate atmosphere including the way it is told by a narrator. The movie has some highlights (I esp. like the scene where half of his head slips off) but it lacks from the absence of a "hero(ine)" or whatever central character to identify with.

Yuck!. I expected a dark, terse, exciting horror film. Instead, I got this. Now, no offense to the people who made it, but this was the most disappointing film since...(twenty seconds later)...since...Anyhow, I didn't like it. It didn't scary me at all (okay, the scene with Noah, Samara, and the TV was a LITTLE bit creepy). Actually, I thought it was more comedy than horror, such as the scene my friends and I have dubbed "The Suicidal Demon Horse Scene!" (I cracked up when I saw that, not that there's anything funny horses die).And another thing! People in horror movie's are SO STUPID. It really ticks me off. I was near the end of the movie, and Rachel (was that her name?) was trapped in the well, and she finds (spoilers) and I'm like "WHY THE HECK DID YOU WATCH THAT STUPID TAPE IN THE FIRST PLACE!?"There were really two things I liked.

Should be titled Statistics While Yawning. I had to read this book for a statistics class I'm taking and it was the most painful experience I've ever had while reading a book. Most of the time it felt like I was reading, "blah blah blah blah blah." No there weren't tears, but I was definitely yawning throughout the whole thing. In fact, I woke up in the middle of the night recently and couldn't get back to sleep so I picked up this book and started reading. It worked great in helping me get back to sleep. This book is NOT for the average, normal person. It's pretty much for Derek Rowntree alone. He's the only one who would really find the things he's written of interest. He makes statistics a bore and I normally love math. DON'T get this book and if you're a professor/instructor PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don't make your students read it. Unless of course you pride yourself on being the most hated professor...in which case assigning this book should do the trick!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great Buy. These were a nice set of knives and quite sharp. We were quite impressed by the quality for the price. These items should all be hand-washed since the dishwasher can dull the edges very quickly.The knives are stainless steel in color, and come in a nice black block. The weight of the knives were decent (not too heavy, nor too light). It makes a wonderful addition to every kitchen.$LABEL$1,0,-100
An Entertaining Legal Thriller. This is the second in the 'Chambers of Justice' series by Craig Parshall. As with the first one, this is well done.The plot centers around the child welfare authorities trying to remove parental custody based on an allegation of terrible child abuse. There are many twists and turns throughout. The courtroom drama is great as is the rest.In addition to being a legal thriller, this book explores many spiritual issues. The lead character, Will Chambers is a fledgling Christian who is working on his spiritual life in addition to the action in the main storyline. That part is well done also.I will certainly be checking out more books in this series. I recommend this book, but readers should probably start with 'The Resurrection File', which is the first one in this collection.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Throwing pearls before geeks. This DVD presents and incomparable collection of historic dance clips. But whoever is behind Dancetime Publications hasn't got a clue about handling historical material. They ripped out the original soundtracks and replaced them with a ragtime piano track that has nothing to do with either the rhythm of the dancers or the music of the periods. Get this DVD --- because I know of no other source to see these dance clips --- but be prepared to turn the sound off, and wonder how anyone could have blown it this bad in their concept of historical preservation.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Hackman's Great. Gene Hackman is not handsome or suave. He isn't a tough guy in the mold of Bogart or Cagney though he has a manly presence. He doesn't have a romantic persona on screen, but somehow he carries off a believable middle-age romance with Ann Margret in Twice in a Lifetime. Well, who wouldn't if the object of affection was Ann-Margret?When a man leaves his family after fifty, dumps his wife, lovely Ellen Burstyn, and separates himself from his angry daughter, Amy Madigan of the short hair do and Ally Sheedy of the Brat Pack fame, well, all hell breaks lose. If blue collar, Mariner and Sea Hawk rooting, Harry MacKenzie wants a second chance at love, he has to face the wrath of all those that love him.This is an uncharacteristic look at middle-age divorce and love so rare in a Hollywood film. Harry has wrought a moral and ethical riddle. The audience will have to decide.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Simple and very functional. We were looking for a desk for our son's room. This one was the right size and I expect will be able to grow with him through the school years. One slight disappointment we had was the cover for the keyboard tray is attached to the desk and not the tray as some are.

Gabby Reece's book Rocks!. I loved reading BIg Girl in the Middle! I was amazed to find that Gabrielle Reece was more fascinating than I thought she'd be. The girl is witty, beautiful, and she has some pretty deep thoughts on a lot of things-and a great deal of insight to back it all up!

No good. I bought this EH40 on July 2012 for my water heater. It's easy to install and program, just read the instructions. When I was done programing it, and let it do its work I noticed 3 hours later the time was off and the timer programs I had put in where erased. Because it has an AA batery, I installed a brand new one hoping this solved the problem.Programed the timer again and the next day the same thing. The time was off and could not access the programing area beacuse it seemed frozen. I reseted, and placed it on manual and turned the heater on for 3 days and did not disconfigurate. After those 3 days, i programed the timer again and the same thing happend, lost all configuration. I called Intermatic and they were of no help. Started reading online for ways to solve the issue and some people say it's electric noise that scrambles the information. Some say that's not right and just stay away from this product.So now I have a $70.00 on-off manual water heater switch.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Double Duty Product: Best for Removing Long Last Lip Color. I use these pads every day for effortless removal of long lasting lip color such as Cover Girl Outlast, Revlon Colorstay Overtime and Max Factor Lipfinity. The pads are very thin and are saturated with an oil-based liquid.They are also good for removing waterproof mascara, but they do leave oily residue around the eyes. For that reason, when I wear regular non-waterproof mascara, I prefer to take it off with the other formula of Almay eye makeup remover pads that are non-oily.Both of these Almay products are great for travel as they are lightweight, thin and you can put several pads in a zip-lok baggie without taking up much space at all. I've used both formulas for many years and am very happy with them.$LABEL$1,0,-100

As the above reviewer notes, it contains a wealth of entries, secondary meanings, etymology, and a diversity of usage examples that truly reflect the Spanish language of the present day.

Great value and flexibility for the price. I have a larger router and shop built router table and wanted an smaller router for hand held use and general backup. For this price is is like getting a router table, a plunge router and an fixed base for about the price I paid for my 3HP router. The table is not the best in the world but better than any other less than $100 that I have seen. I set it up with a different bit than my main table and can easily pass from one to another. In fact, I can set this table on my larger one as needed. It includes both 1/4 and 1/2 inch collets. Very versatile.$LABEL$1,0,-100

would have been better is not for marketing. There are three problems with the movie. The first of which is lighting. Ok I know is a victorian prision and it not going be the best lit place in the world, but its also just a movie so realism is not needed. The second is the structure its a bit hard to follow all the flash backs, and some extra footage puting sceans into greating contex would be been welcomed. The third is marking, as the ending shows and if follow the drug use of one main characters, its the story of one most brutal assults I have ever seen.

NEW 70'S MUSIC TO ME. I got this last week never having heard of it and with no review's i took a chance and i am glad i did. This is a 2 cd set with cd #2 being live. It is really hard to define there music but there is some very good guitar playing especially in the live cd. The muscian's are tight i guess you could say they play a lot of different music pop/rock/a little country/blue's very good stuff. If you want to try something new from the 70's i would suggest this. I like to find old stuff from that time period that i like and this was worth the price. The opening of the story behind Mendelbaum on the liner note's state's mendelbaum was different. Musically led by the lighting fast ripping lick's of chris michie's cherry red 1968 gibson sg special. He write's most of the song's and his solo's are tight. There are five member's in the band guitar organ bass keyboard's and drum's. Very fresh music from the 70's i hope you like it as much as i have good stuff.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Why Pan and Scan?. The Journey Of Natty Gann is the story about the adventures of a young woman from Chicago who is on the road to find her father who was sent all the way to Washington to work. Along the way, she befriends a wolf-dog(the same animal that played in the 1991 film White Fang), and a drifter. The bad thing about this dvd version is that it is only in pan and scan when it should be widescreen. We are only seeing half of the picture! DvDs were developed to make movies look as good on television screens as they did when they first came out in theaters. It is a matter of choice, but I refuse to buy any DVD, Disney included, that is not in its correct aspect ratio, and I urge anyone who feels the same way to contact them and try to get them to release a widescreen version of this movie.$LABEL$0,0,-100

"The lyrical King, from Da' Boogie Down Bronx!!". "Commentating, illustrating/ description given, adjective expert..." were the eye opening, jaw dropping, opening words on the ground-breaking, mega Hip-Hop classic, hit-single "IT'S YOURS". Although the lyrics on "IT'S YOURS" were written by his older brother "SPECIAL K" (member of the Treacherous 3), T La Rock would later team up with producer extraordinaire and master of the beat "MANTRONIK", and put out a string of classic hits through out the mid '80's. T is better known for his superb lyrical eloquence and metaphor mechanics (and giving birth to LL's original style of rap. Just listen to his first album closely). Super Rapper T La Rock has NEVER recorded a wack record. All his joints are "Funky Fresh"! This CD contains nothing less than classic, raw, B-Boy material. This is Hip-Hop in it's purest , rawest form. In T La Rock's own words "strong lyrics, no gimmicks, no yes, yes, ya'll!"$LABEL$1,0,-100

Audiovox Goes to Maine. We recently took a road trip to Maine with our two children ages 11 and 14. I purchased 2 Audiovox DVD players and 2 cases that attach to the head rests. It was great! We took quite a few movies with us and the trip went so fast for the kids. They were easy to operate and the bonus was the ipod doc. I recommend these Audiovox DVD players to everyone with kids. They are fabulous. The screen quality is excellent and the sound is too. Oh and the kids love having thier own remotes to operate it. As I always say....happy kids...happy parents! Thank you. Mrs. S. Brown - Tenafly, NJ$LABEL$1,0,-100
slap me when it's over. this is a boring read for me. too much revelry in describing everything and i mean everything. no shortage of new characters. they come and go one after another. i just wanted to get to Dracula! pacing leaves a lot to be desired. mid-read, i skipped pages when there's no action going on (believe me, still describing and describing....on and on and on....) and headed for the climax. guess what? did not miss a thing.$LABEL$0,0,-100
What a Disappointment!. I had looked forward to this book very much. I am fascinated with books and their history, and the background and subject matter give this book an entirely different level for enjoyment.But I have had it with the hero: Alex Plumtree who is beginning to look more and more like the world's biggest patsy. The things which happen to him, mostly brought about by people who "have been sworn to secrecy" or who "just want to protect him" boggle the imagination. It's time he stood up to his "friends" and said, "Enough already." Unless of course he enjoys being the fool.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great tool. We had two cheap department store pepper mills that were driving me crazy. I love to cook and if you're making a large pot of anything or seasoning a roast to go in the oven it took forever to get enough pepper ground. In addition, I have carpal tunnel so not only was I frustrated, it was painful too! I didn't particularly want to spend $50-$100 to get a really "good" pepper mill. This pepper mill, like all the Oxo products I've tried, is well made and extremely well designed for doing the job it was meant for with maximum comfort and maximum efficiency. Thank goodness there are companies like Oxo!$LABEL$1,0,-100
old batteries. the batteries that they sent me was older than the one i had in my phone, and would not hold a charge. they did try to fix the problem by sending me replacements (3 total) and the last one was a little better that the one that was in my phone.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Wonderful intro to music of Portugal's former African colonies. I lucked into this CD for free(!), and I am so glad. It introduced me to Cesaria Evora and other fabulous artists from these countries. The beats are infectious, the music often haunting and always interesting. It's still in regular rotation in my home. I recommend it highly!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Belly ache laughing type of funny. Bought this DVD for my kids (10,8,6,4 & 2) after watching the Flintstones movie on tv from the mid-90's. We watched season 1 in the car in route to the beach and I have NEVER heard my kids laugh so hard. It's clean, good fun for the whole family without any sexual/inappropriate undertones as you find in most kids shows/movies.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Poor Release of Movie. I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time. It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning. The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my rating$LABEL$0,0,-100
vulgar, disgusting, and hysterical!. definately not for the timid or sensative listener. i love his music! he is funny as anything and has a great voice. hes unafraid to sing about the twisted and bizare. it also doesnt hurt that he is sooo good looking.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Had a few funny moments. This movie has some good moments that generated a few laughs from a chuckle to a gut busting guffaw. Then it got weird and stupid.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great in any genre. I have read this book cover-to-cover four times. I never fail to find something new and revealing in it-some fresh aspect I had not properly explored previously. All history should be written this well. But beyond history, Connell brings a novelist's eye as to which details are telling and worth the reader's time. This book should have won the pulitzer, but that is another matter.$LABEL$1,0,-100
I love this CD!!. I bought 2 of these CD's one to play in my car the whole time and another to play in my house. I'm thinking about buying another as a back up! hehe Carrie has such a lovely voice. You won't regret buying this one!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Like A Train Wreck---I Still Watched It. This is supposed to be a remake of a French film; I haven't seen the French version, which is just as well, because a film should stand on its own merits.With the exception of several, isolated, instances, this comedy is not funny. The problem is the script and therefore the directing, pure and simple, not the acting. Regardless of the French version, this is another instance of an old, re-rehashed theme beaten to death by Hollywood: a social misfit who accidentally creates havoc gets superglued to the straight guy, driving him bonkers, but by the end of the film the misfit endears himself to the straight guy and even saves him from some problem or other. Like I said, an old, old cliche done to death (You Me and Dupree is a relatively recent one, for example; What About Bob? had the saving grace that the straight guy never embraces the misfit and is instead driven mad).$LABEL$0,0,-100
Sensual, Beautiful Movie. Texas used to be owned by Mexico before the U.S. occupied Mexico City in 1847 and in 1848 a peace treaty was signed; Mexico ceded Texas, California and New Mexico (including all the present-day states of the Southwest).Anyway, I forgot about this bit of U.S. history and this movie reminded me of that, which is an enlightening part of its subplot.With this in the backdrop, the romantic love story between Tita and Pedro unfolds.If you remember ever being truly in-love, I feel some scenes will remind you of that feeling, what a nice surprise...$LABEL$1,0,-100
Tea time delight.... I'm a fan of Margaret Rutherford and Agatha Christie...so this is a charming, delightful way to spend a bit of time...best viewed with hot tea and scones.$LABEL$1,0,-100
didn't like it. I came across this book looking for one about cancer and thought it sounded (and looked) interesting. It wasn't! The whole book is just reading different e-mails the author and her friends wrote to each other, and more than half the time I didn't know what they were talking about. I didn't even know who these people were to the author (like sister, Aunt, etc., I THINK they were friends,) and what some of the things and places mentioned were. It got confusing the more I read and there wasn't much explaination about subjects being discussed, since these were just letters between two people. I found the book very boring and couldn't even get through the whole thing. Very disappointing.$LABEL$0,0,-100
