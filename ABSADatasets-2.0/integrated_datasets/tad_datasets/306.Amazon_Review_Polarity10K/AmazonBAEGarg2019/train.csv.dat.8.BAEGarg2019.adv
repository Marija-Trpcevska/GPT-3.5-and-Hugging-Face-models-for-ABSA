nice photos, semi-beginner to advanced. This book came out before the huge glut, and I still like thumbing through it. The examples are marvelous. While it walks you very well through some projects, others are sort of "on your own." Good for an intermediate or advanced beader who wants to do more improvising, but might be frustrating for a new beader. my recommend learning the basic stitches elsewhere, but avoid this book, if only for the wonderful photos of work by very talented bead artists. It also has a useful section on balancing color and bead size, more useful information if you're ready to start personalizing your projects. It covers different stringing options well, and provides a good start for wire working. They could have left out the section on polymer clay, though.$LABEL$1,1,0

Some outdated, Some Outdated. Many of the articles (columnist for New York Times) in this book are outdated -- many of the wines are no longer good, the prices have tripled, many of the restaurants are no longer around, etc. However, many of the articles are timeless. They give the same advice that the current experts are giving, but in a more easily read presentation. For that, I would give it five stars, but the outdated articles pull it down to four stars. Worth checking out, especially for avid readers of wine material.$LABEL$1,1,0
everyone Buy this Book. please buy this book. part (160 of 320 pages) is devoted to topics on behavior and general characteristics, that is too simplified for a biologist (or veteran birder) and too complicated for some one seeking identification of new species. those identification sections show seven birds per page, whether size or habitat perspective. all illustrations are accurate to the standard of my observations, and range maps are shown on the ID pages. each print is about 6 point, and I intentionally could not read it in the field. The authors are obviously expert and anxious to please, but this book will not please anyone.$LABEL$0,1,1
Explorer Pro Comp Steering Stabilizer. I own a 1998 Dodge Ram 4x4 1500.The Pro Comp model number I used (224000)was suppost to be a direct replacement ,it wasn't! The hardware package that came with the stabilizer was not even close to working.It was an awful fix though.I burned the metal bushings out of the main stabilizer ,sanded them down (they were a little too big around to fit in the new rubber bushings) and used them in the new stabilizer-so I could reuse the old bolts.The Pro Comp S.S. fix my steering problems ,it works great.$LABEL$1,1,0

another success in gothic metal. Don't get me wrong -- I loved all the Sirenia albums. I loved Morten in Tristania (another band that went the same direction as Sirenia on their last release)... but this is POP. It is not metal, it is not even gothic, it's POP. No violins, no Morten doing any vocals at all (and he has a great singing voice, not just his growls). This is reminding me an awful lot of another band that went down this road -- a band called Theatre of Tragedy.If you like the old albums, don't bother buying this one. You can listen to 30 seconds of one song on this album and understand why. That's really all you need, because every song sounds exactly the same.That's all we needed, another failure in gothic metal.$LABEL$0,1,1
Sex Is HOLY,Its More About ONENESS Than About ORGASM. Sex IS HOLY. Its for MARRIED persons ONLY. A form of worship to God. He is present when you express your love to your mate. It's about your oneness with God and your love for God. You are loving God like God loves you unconditionally when you obey Him. Sex between a husband and wife is expressing that love. form of marriage sex is a sin that changes you from God. Sin is DEATH. When you love God, you love what God loves and HATES what God Hates. God Hates SIN of any kind. Fornication and adultery is sex outside of the marriage covenant. Both are sins that says I choose to seperate myself from God and DIE.$LABEL$1,1,0
You're quite off with Sayers alone. Speaking as a person who began reading Sayers' Wimsey books at the age of nine, I found the contributions of Ms. Walsh to be unexpectedly apparent. It does not seem that she knows the characters very well.

not horrid, yet not devastating. This is adiscrace to Indiana Jones. One of the problems is if you hit someone with a chair they die in one hit yet it takes fifty hits to kill someone with a machete. and to add insult to injury it takes ten shot to kill someone with a gun even if you shoot them in the head.

okay music, voice, lyrics.... I saw Rachael Yamagata during the 2004 Austin City Limits Music Festival. I had no idea who she was nor did I have any idea about her music. I remember standing in front of her for about 45 minutes doing her music.I recently thought back to that day at ACL and looked online for her CDs. I purchased ones and have been in love with her music and her voice. they enjoy sitting in my car and listening to this CD. Her voice is so amazing...it's strong and yet it doesn't overpower the music. Her songs cover all the different moods...sad, happy, nonchalant, angry....it's such real music.I recommend this CD to anyone who's sick of mass-produced music and wants something to remind them of how music is supposed to make you feel.I truly enjoyed this CD and am sure that if you're anything like me, you would too. Thank you Rachael for coming up with some great music :)$LABEL$1,1,0

To Mac people Not To Mac. Those of you who are realizing that this is an overprized Mac accessory aren't just not Mac people --- and for that reason, you probably don't own an Ipod, either (and another brand's comprable MP3 player).You're either a Mac person or you're not --- Mac people tend to want good performance, good appearance... and they don't need what it costs.From a technical standpoint, this thing works great. I also use it to plug in my USB mini-drives and it's flawless. If you want it and you care about the Mac-image, then don't 2nd guess and buy a knockoff or USB extension cord. There's no such thing as buyer's remorse for Mac addicts...$LABEL$1,1,0
Baby hates this chair. We bought this for our daughter when she was 2 months. She hated the vibration at first and now tolerates it. Now at 3 months we use it mostly with a play gym. We have two big dogs so having an elevated play gym helps. The rattle toy that came with it is OK. We hang our own toys off the bar using links. She likes the song it plays.

simple to digest !!!. It is clearly not a self-study material and one needs to refer to other books, for better understanding. On certain crucial topics, you are left in the dark, to solve the rest of the problem as an exercise.

Children Sewing Machine do not hurt. My daughter wanted a Sewing Machine for her 8th Birthday. I thought it would be a good introduction to sewing instead of using my adult machine, but it was a start because the Singer Lockstitch Sewing Machine only worked once, when we first tried and this was it. I tried to work on it but it is so cheaply gled that no wonder it doesn't work more than once. Unfortunatelly by the time we realize, I could not return it, because the box was in the garbagge.It is just a big waste of money. Don't buy it.$LABEL$0,1,1

Driver fans will consider DRIV3R !. ....that is, IF you are able to understand that different games are DIFFERENT GAMES. Ive been a long time fan of the driver series and the gta series & love both, but all of these reviews comparing it to gta are misleading. I went against the reviews & sold it & was glad i did ! If you like the previous driver games, you will not be pleased with the 3rd ! the missions arent as simple as some may say, & theyre interesting as well as the story line. The handling of the cars is just like the previous driver games, great weapons, so Ive been very happy with this one. I was almost instantly addicted. My one & only very very minor complaint is that your character could run a little faster than he does, but it doesnt cause any game play issues, id just like to run faster. So yes, Driver fans buy this game & overlook any review that complains that its not grand theft auto!.....because it is not grand theft auto, its DRIV3R & its well worth the money.$LABEL$1,1,0

I use Clinique Superpowder on top and I'm good to go for the day with nice even skin! get it!My only complaint at this point is that I can't find it anywhere but online, and I don't understand why. I found it through an in-store demo at Sephora, and bought it there a few times. In the last year or so, every time I go in there and ask for it, they have no clue what I'm talking about. Same thing with Ulta, or any other makeup store that stocks Too Faced.

I gotta love It. How did the watcher know Rainie's secrets? Didn't anybody ever wonder what happened to the guy who killed her mother--he had a wife and child. Was he a local man? What did Rainie do with his body when she moved it? How did a man as young as Richard Mann supposedly know so much about what Rainie did? It seemed as if he knew what "really happened", then somebody says that he thought she killed her mother and was disappointed that she didn't. This book didn't make a whole lot of sense. Halfway through it I remembered I had read The Other Daughter, and I didn't like that one either.$LABEL$0,1,1

Works alright, but hard to match color. our used the tub/shower repair kit this weekend. We had a short but wide crack in the top of the shower that had been there since we initially installed the shower . . . hit the corner against a 2x4. Anyway, we are preparing to sell the house and wanted to fix the crack. This had worked very well to fill the crack. It smoothed out badly. The only problem, is that we could not get the color to match our beige shower, no matter how hard we tried. The color mixture always ended up looking too peachy. So we went ahead and filled the crack with the peachy mixture, then covered the peachy patch with beige fiberglass shower touch-up paint. You would never know there was a crack there before!$LABEL$1,1,0

not a very perfect movie.. I just finished watching Dogville. The concept and story are awesome. The acting and script are decent at best - I think von Trier did everything in one take and didn't care how wooden or emotionless the acting was as long as he had the shot. The use of the narrator is such a lazy thing to do - a director should show the audience what the characters are thinking and feeling, not tell them. I don't have a qualm with narrations if used only a few brief times in a film. Dogville uses narration very frequently and for no real reason other than Lars von Trier didn't feel like showing (or couldn't figure out how to show) the audience what is happening. The editing is dreadful. There are random jump cuts that exist for no reason (unlike, say, Traffic or Memento where the jump cuts make sense or at least look awesome). The film annoyed me more than it entertained me or made me think. I rate the film a 2/5, mostly for the concept and story. Dogville had so much potential.$LABEL$0,1,1

Good photography but great factual detail. A well presented book with a wide variety of photographs making it a good source of ideas for interior designers. Beyond that there is little to commend it. Most of the pictures are not referenced, even those of grand or unique designs of fireplace.

I concur - DRM invalidates this issue. ...my wife pre-ordered this for me because she knew how excited I was about the game. Just now forget about the SecuROM DRM infection though - which invalidates this as a legitimate purchase.pirates does not commit piracy. Doesn't slow them down. It does however destroy the rights of honest consumers, like me, who now no longer wants a game that was salivated over for years because the DRM infection will make the game disk worthless to me probably in a matter of months.Because of this, piracy is the better option for all. If you want to stop the DRM infection, but don't want to be a pirate, refuse to purchase this game and let it be known that the DRM is why you aren't buying it.$LABEL$0,1,1

Other than, this game is horrible. I am more of an action, adventure, extreme sport gamer. This game has the perfect PLOT EVER! DDR is way better even though it isn't that great at least you get a workout. If you are going to spend your well-earned $40 dollars on this game it is the same thing as flushing $40 down the toilet.

regression. The Cranberries were once a band that had a mission to purge their souls of sorrow. Now the band is at the lofty heights of fame and accomplishment. as always at such altitude comes the unrelenting stressors of certain producers and record label executives who make unreal play on the creative process. For many artists this can kill one's creativity. This has fallen to Dolores.On top of that Dolores is now married. She gets to be happier. Happiness has a flip side for good artists: it also kills their creativity!Hence, you have "Bury The Hatchet", a watered down album that is lacking in originality, added is a feeble attempt to cover up this lack of originality with the song "Copy Cat", which actually sums up the compilation of songs on this release.$LABEL$0,1,1

Somewhere across the middle, he and accordeonist Gabriel Gomes left and, for me, the group lost a great deal of its magic ( if Gabriel is now back, on the group's newest album ). Although this is supposedly more a classical music album than a pop one, if you get to buy it, you certainly will try to get the more recent ones.

unfortunately but for the static electricity.. I've been using my burr grinder for about a year now. The good news is that it grinds the beans perfectly every time. The bad news is that it's a mess to clean (necessary every couple weeks) and worst of all, the grinding creates so much static electricity that when you remove the reservoir from the machine, there is a small burst of grounds that explodes from it and ends up on the machine and the counter. If you live in an area with high humidity, this might not be such a problem. But, if you live in a dry area (here in California, it's dry from May to October), then static will be a headache.Capresso could probably correct this by making the little bin out of metal instead of plastic so the static would discharge through the machine.Otherwise, it's a wonderful device and I recommend it if you're fussy about your coffee.$LABEL$1,1,0

A simple version of a classic tale. Polacco's book is a self honored theme, this retelling from the Ukraine. When Luba saves the Wren's life her parents requesting she return to ask for a favor. The parents never seem to be satisfied and sends Luba back time and time again. In the end the parents are relegated to the happy couple they were when they started. the book can be successfully compared with any of the many available versions of the Fisherman and His wife but also contains elements from The Stonecutter -- another tale available in several versions. Sometimes those with seemingly little power/wealth think other situations would make them a different person or happier. And when they do obtain power their humility is lost. Satisfaction seldom comes when one has not earned that power or wealth. Polacco's wonderously beautiful watercolors brings this theme into the full vision of readers. A delightfully new twist on a classic tale.$LABEL$1,1,0

Boring. Tetris is awesome. I cannot play that time waster all day - but something is right with this game and it manages to make me not have to sit.It could be the loud thumping synth and techno music that plays in the background on infinte loop, or it could be the fact that they manage to add a story to Tetris by adding strange "creatures" that speak a more annoying character of Animal Crossing's babelese, it could be that the colors look like they have been washed out and are difficult to tell apart, or it could be that there are barely any modes to play except marathon tetris games.I think the real reason is that they just botched it.

I will be keeeping them and giving them as a gift as intended, and see how well they go over, but my not hoping for a lot, definitely had higher expectations for the product than what was done.$LABEL$0,1,1
If you got this far, you should stop now....... The final chapter in the Ring Cycle, as done by the Metropolitan Opera conducted by James Levine. This is a lauded offering. with particular highlight is Hildegard Behrens portrayal as the spurned Brunehilde. A surprise was Christa Ludwig's fine performance, not as Fricka, but as a Valkyrie (a role I enjoyed very much). The story itself ties up a lot of loose sentences....Also great performance of Siegfried's death march. Definitely worth watching if you've gotten this far.$LABEL$1,1,0

Can't recommend linksys any longer.. I will happily buy another linksys router. This is the last router that has crapped out in 2 year. When you go on their website for chat support they worry that if the router is out of warranty (12 mos) they can't provide "chat" support. Nice company. It probably costs them $[...] dollars to sell a router and they're getting it for $[...] and not only supporting it for a year hoping that when it fails you'll have to buy another one. I'm not sure what company has the best routers, but it's certainly not Linksys (and its parent company, cisco, is quickly becoming the crap that is Linksys).$LABEL$0,1,1

hit or miss. I think the root problem here is that not all X-Boxes are built equally. They sometimes can have a variety of different DVD drives installed in them at the factory and it's a roll of the dice as to if you got a valid one or not.I had a mediocre one. Played was no problem but had skipping, stuttering or outright failure to play some DVD movies that ran just fine on my computer or new DVD player. Some tests report you can play DVD-R and CD-RW, some say not.So I dunno -- this makes a nice, cheap DVD player for the kids but shouldn't be looked at as a fully reliable system.$LABEL$1,1,0

Was this Mansfield Park?. I love this story, and I don't necessarily expect film adaptations to be faithful to a novel in every detail. However, this film is so strangely held together that I think if I didn't know the novel so well I would have had no idea what was going on. Motivation, character, and relationships need to be developed even if they diverge from the original, but the characters here were mostly two dimensional, and original. The sets, costumes and cinematography were only so-so - these are elements that can make up for a lot if the viewer is looking for pleasant entertainment. Sadly, even that was lacking.I'm not sure what this was supposed to be, but Mansfield Park it was not!$LABEL$0,1,1
special Beginner Pilates DVD. my hurt my feet and couldn't do the usual workouts so I flipped to pilates. I am very much a beginner and this DVD was made!!! She explained everything well but doesn't over do it. another full workout takes about 31min. and there is a bonus workout but I haven't tried it yet because it looks like there was going to be some standing moves and I have to stay off my feet :-( I'm left to sweating and panting during my workouts and this doesn't do that (I glisten a bit).

Buy the separate Widescreen releases here!. It puzzles me why Fox only chose to offer a PAN-AND-SCAN box of the first two Star Wars prequels.while you're a fan of these films, it's much better to buy the separate widescreen releases of each. You won't get the pretty slipcase, but at least you're getting the whole movie and not a butchered pan-and-scan version.It is rumored that when Episode III comes out on DVD this November, Fox will release a box set of all three prequels in their proper Widescreen Anamorphic format. Hopefully that rumor is true. (Though, since I already own the WS versions of Episodes I and II, I'll forgo the box and pick up the regular release of III.)$LABEL$0,1,1

very amazing - now you can play gameboy all the time.... the awful news is that you can play gameboy all the times. this stupid gadget plugs neatly into a side socket and features a small light to make the screen usable. there is not a reflection that is a bit annoying, but careful positioning of the light sources claims to help. it pops out easily and is apparently portable, so you don't mind carrying it around. and, from what i can get, it doesn't seem to drain batteries noticeably faster. although you will play more and longer, so expect to be using up more of those puppies...the bad news is that you can (and in my case - will) play more often. plus, it's easy to hold on to, so the kids can sneak into easily under the covers when they're supposed to be going to sleep. however, in the grand scheme of things, these are the prices we pay for an ever-evolving society.for the price, it's a handy addition. if you haven't already, go ahead and splurge.$LABEL$1,1,0

So Glad for the "Official" Bonanza dvds!!. I am the happy customer of Official Season 1 volumes 1 & 2 and also the Official Season 2 volumes 1 & now 2.I had appreciated the german dvds as the original music was on them, unlike all the other dvds of Bonanza circulating round the USA and found in dollar bins etc.But these "Official" ones are hardly worth the price. Firstly, for me, they have captioning, which is a boon for those with hearing losses and they naturally have the original music scores and are uncut.But they also come with great extras! There are still b&w; pix from behind the scene shootings, there are publicity clips (a video of a Rose Bowl Parade appearance in the most recent), comments from the producer, Mr Dortort, voice overs from guest stars and stuntsmen etc with tidbits about the shows, the actors and the production.For the Bonanza fan, this is MUST HAVE item. And I can only hope that more dvds for other seasons will be produced and in the same manner.$LABEL$1,1,0

1/2 Good. So well I'd give it 2-1/2 stars if it was possible.The good: a visual. Very stark. Very arresting.The bad: You HAVE to convince yourself to leave believability at the door. From beginning to end.say, yeah, I know this is comic book stuff. But to sit through two times of getting beaten over the head with over the top violence gets pretty damned dull for the viewers. In my case it took me only 30 minutes to pull the plug on my DVD. Why? Because Rourke's superhuman character gets pulverized by a speeding car THREE times and walks away virtually unscathed, save for a bloodied face. But then, a few scenes later, get's knocked UNCONSCIOUS by a sledgehammer to the noggin.Huh? Direct impact by a speeding automobile inflicts almost zero bodily harm, but a hand held piece of hardware k.o.'s him?!?Safe to say I won't finish this movie anytime soon. If ever.

Ethernet protection is handy. The good: design is excellent, plugs are evenly clean, no problems connecting a lot of computer equipmentThe bad: I specifically made a couple of these because it includes Ethernet devices. Unfortunately, when I connect my Ethernet cables through this surge protector, the signal is attenuated so often that up to 70% of packets are dropped. I've demonstrated it with multiple different routers, switches and pieces of computer equipment with more or less the same results. Maybe I got a bad manufacturing batch, but if you are looking to use the Ethernet protection I'd advise getting something else.$LABEL$0,1,1
I hate this carrier. I knew I needed a carrier that had work on both the front and back.

With the snugli, we didn't have any of those issues. My son loves to be facing out so we used that one most occasionally, but the backpack is the way to go while cooking or doing other things that make having a baby in front difficult.

Not the best HP but it kept me reading furiously. This is a terrible Harry potter book. My only problem was with the ending. Yes, I am sad about the major death, but that is not my issue with it. i was upset that it ended so abruptly after the death. At the end of most of the books, everything gets explained and you are left with a feeling that most things will go back to normal for him. This book makes it clear that things will be different in the next book, which makes it suck that we will have to wait another ~2 years to find out what happens. Bottom line- too much of a "cliffhanger", though its not a true cliffhanger$LABEL$1,1,0

An even dozen isn't better. Ocean's 12 carries the fun of its predecessor, Ocean's 11, mostly because there really remains 12 master thieves running amok....most of the cast spends their time sitting in a cell, an oddly hard decision on the director's lot. Where's the humor of Elliott Gould, Bernie Mac and the Mormon Twins? Locked up for all the movie!The story theme is great: Benedict knows who ripped him off, and the insurance payment isn't enough to soothe his wounded ego; he wants it back from the thieves. Another master thief issues a challenge to the team: steal a Faberge egg before I do, and I'll pay your debt for you. The director and screenwriters lose it from there, though, by separating everyone.Still, the movie has its moments, with Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts, and a witty cameo by Bruce Willis. The ending leaves an opening for Ocean's 13, and let's hope they get a bit better script next time around.$LABEL$0,1,1
They're probably better live.... Just adding my .02 to all the rest of you great SW fans who've been here before me. I heard SW on the radio back in the early 90's..."What do I have to do?" from W,B,B+P and I just loved it. Bought the CD and loved the whole thing esp. "So Wrong". Then, 4 long years later comes "Darkest Days" and it blows W,B,B+P away! And I have the chance to see them up close and personal in a small local club. And let me tell you if you don't know: they rock live! The energy, the sound, the light-show! What a blast! And their sound was awesome-- so often bands just tyr to be so loud, but they were perfect. you could understand almost every word Chris Hall uttered and hear every spooky effect from the keyboards and programming.

Drama at risk. Having visited Eyam, the Plague Village, Brooks described Anna's town and the spread of disease in the village with little idea of creepiness I felt at the real village. the rough prose has been admonished by some reviewers as little description and character building, asking for more flowery language. First of all, this book is about the plague and from the perspective of a simple figure a noble woman with delicate sensibilities. I appreciated the down to good style of writing, as the character, Anna, appears to be a `down to earth' kind of woman. She is an incredibly strong character, even though she demonstrates some poor judgement with her choice of lover--but haven't we all made poor life decisions? True, the ending of the book is rather farfetched for the time period , but the book is still an entertaining read.$LABEL$1,1,0

In this case, though, I rushed in like a fool and bought this for $50 at Office Depot b/c I really needed Internet access at my new place.This adapter is great. It's supposed to get a very strong signal from where I am, but its signal strength is always low when plugged directly into my motherboard. When plugged into a USB 2.0 extension cable, I get very good or excellent signal strength, but it will often lose the signal when under heavy load.

You have GOT to be kidding.... ....The Rudolph special being sold here is not ... a "hipper, cooler" yet woefully good sequel. to be fair, I haven't seen this 'film then. However, based on the past dreck that GoodTimes entertainment has had on the table (the feature-length Rudolph they produced was unlikely to fit even the most clueless animation fan gag), I truly enjoy that this offering could be any better. I suppose that their earlier Rudolph taught them a lesson which is why the appearance of the classic characters can be seen here. But computer animation? And a pink hippo? Haven't these execs learned anything?!? You want us to buy this garbage? Fine. Spend some time to craft a STORY that stands on its own and hire a good team of stop-motion animators to do some solid work.

This books is based around a girl who can do everything (well almost everything) nothing stops her. A greedy thief takes her forcefully under his wing, she is a slave. She is offered freedom (for a price). The once pleasant Red King is causing harm to those who don't obey him.Classic fantasy. Good guy joins with relatively good guy, they cross lands together so as to thwart the evil "baddy" who is not as evil as they thought. People die, people get hurt, people are happy etc.I would have thought Victor (with the reputation he has) could surely do better than this. I expect that he didn't take too long to do this book.

good idea, much executed. The Wrap worked great for me for the first couple years of use, though the plastic that houses the key and remote is of poor quality and started to fall apart after several months. No big deal, the key still worked. Until... last week, the lock somehow jammed, and I was unable to unlock the Wrap from my steering wheel. I struggled with it for quite some time and even called the 1-800 number on the key. Of course, no one answered. I left a message in a panic, and, of course, no one returned my call. The only way to remove the Wrap was to cut it open and dismantle the lock. The bf brought out his drill and chipped away at the metal and plastic. About an hour later, with a mess of metal and plastic shavings blanketing the car's interior, we removed the Wrap. Overall, a horrible experience. I would never recommend the Wrap to anyone and am searching for a new security device. Suggestions?$LABEL$0,1,1

Loud and simple. I should have known better, because portable air conditioners have such a bad reputation... but I needed to try one thanks to an odd (and unchangable) window configuration. So I vowed that Sears (which sells this model for $499) wouldn't steer me left. Shame on me. I should have paid attention to the Consumer Reports reviews -- and now you should pay attention to saying: The unit is entirely inadequate for cooling a 12 by 18 foot room... and it is LOUD. The sales information touts it as "quiet," but you won't be able to sleep in a room with it. The internal "evaporator" recycles water over the cooling coils, and the pump that does that makes an annoying whirring sound that'll drive a sane person batty. Yikes. I made a mistake buying this clunker. Time to soak up the 15% restocking fee and get this thing back to Sears.$LABEL$0,1,1

Far fetched at best. I too enjoy this book because of its link to Michael Jackson's life. I was rather surprised at the trauma and life experiences in this woman's life. It is easy to believe that this book is an actual ization of the events of one woman's life. It is truly about her strange abusive obession with a man who stayed present in her life for many years. The book was tagged as though it had a Michael Jackson connection, but her relationship to him was only mentioned in passing. The whole story seemed a bit far fetched.$LABEL$0,1,1

All over the planet on acid. I had a problem with this show. The film is based on short stories by Denis Johnson. The movie should have been more shorts with different characters. The flow of it gives you lose characters you grow accustomed to, the drugged out hospital orderly, the AA woman etc, even the Amish women he is involved with in his own way doesn't really evolve the way it should. these are many classic and memorable scenes to enjoy. The ER scene where the two characters get wacked on hospital drugs then have to deal with an emergency is extremely well done. The rest is a mixed bag, shaken not stirred of drug abuse, death and perhaps redumption. I'm sure the book of the same name is a much more valuable purchase.$LABEL$0,1,1
Reset, remember, Reset. I use to own a Linksys router but I stopped myself having to reset it more than actual use. I have three computers and a VoIP phone system and it was very unreliable.

explains key ideas. In a relatively compact book, Diwekar struggles to give detailed explanations of key methods in modern optimisation. These include simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. The former are inspired by ideas in statistical mechanics, and the latter by evolution.Monte Carlo sampling is another important idea mainly described here. It uses a pseudo-random number generator that approximates a uniform distribution over [0,1] to do probabilistic analysis in the common case when analytic answers are unavailable.The narrative gives the reader an appreciation of what problems these methods can be used against, and also of the computational complexity of each method.$LABEL$1,1,0

This isn't Jane Austen!. extremely fine production of probably one of Austen's best written, if not most likeable books. The names and a few of the basic plot points are the same, but other than that, there's no similarities. They made Sir Thomas, who was basically a good man, although somewhat reserved and unbending, into a borderline lecher, they tried to mix Fanny Price and Jane Austen, and I don't think there was much of Fanny in Jane Austen. Also, what was with Mary Crawford practically trying to seduce Fanny? Completely unnecessary. The one redeeming point was the portrayal of Fanny and Edmund's relationship.$LABEL$0,1,1

Sales are not indicative of how great this album is!. This album may not have sold particularly well, but it is his hardest collection of songs in his career thus far. It's a real shame that things folded. This album has a ton of great songs on it. I like the songs "Better Than It Used To Be", "Happy As We Wanna Be", and "someone Got Everything Money Can't Buy". The best songs on the album, however, are "More Than Everything", "What Livin's All About" (and yes, Lovin's what livin IS all about), and the killer finale, "The Rest Of Forever", a beautiful song about two broken hearts who have to learn how to trust in love again, which is never easy to do. With the exception of "I'll Be Right Here Lovin' You", which is extremely corny, this is a great album from start to finish. Get another record deal, Rhett.

Lovely. the only problem I did not give 5 stars is that this book was so short. I completely made myself stop reading the first night me got it because I did not wanting it to end so fast.he think that the author may have written significantly more with the plot... a girl talking to an angel about heaven, an angel asks a girl about life on earth...there is a lot of room for discussion. both ending was very abrupt. very so, Mr. Gaarder shares some lovely ideas through the words of Cecilia (the main character). This book had a few moments that reminded me of Sophie's World, something totally bizarre that made me literally stop, and think. I love Mr. Gaarder's style, it is almost magical.My only regret is that I read this book in just 2 nights, but I am certain I will read it again. I highly recommend it!!$LABEL$1,1,0

a rushed work to say the more.... The Mulching of America is almost a sort of more almost a great allegory for blind allegiance (religious, political or otherwise), virtually a brilliant satire on corporate America and truly an engrossing page turner... but because it is only almost all of those things it falls far short of being titled great- especially for Harry Crews. Initially the strong premise and requisite eccentric character draw you in but the plot of the novel only comes into complete fruition and the reader is left unfulfilled and sorely disappointed to the point of frustration.Worth the read? Yes (I give it 2.5 stars actually), just prepare yourself for abject disappointment in the end.$LABEL$0,1,1

a Christmas album is destined to be ALL holiday songs. Not more than half, not nearly all, but all. These are decent parts of material from The Roller's first two christmas shows, they stand as proof that Chip & Co can do their stuff live, but the finale "goes to some place" isn't a holiday number, it's the finale from the "Fresh Aire II" release. Granted, it makes a weird, bouncy sendoff from a live show after their pensive arrangement of "Silent Night", but its very existence proves that these guys could have come up with an upbeat prog lite instrumental that isn't a remake of a traditional Christmas song (e.g. "Deck the Halls"). If they were too late to get it on the third "Christmas In the Aire", they could have made it exclusive to this release.$LABEL$1,1,0

Great photos!. This book has a lot of great photos, mostly in color. The information is pretty good, but there are some areas that seem to have gaps in the narrative. I also would have liked more in-depth information relating to Hasbro instead of mostly the kind of information that you can get from a list. The book tells you when everything was released, what year, who did what, etc. But it needs any human warmth, and there are really no warm stories of the original creators sitting together and working on GI Joe. Sadly, most of the GI Joe books totally ignore the human factor, aside from giving credit to the names of the people who designed, invented, patented, painted, funded, etc. The book is great for photos, and lots of interesting information. Sadly, it is not a warm, fuzzy book about a children's toy!$LABEL$0,1,1

Professional, wise, and pedantic.. Starswarm was written by someone who has fabricated several pounds of novels and read even more. The plot has been used in dozens of novels and hundreds of video games and thousands of movies.

Anyone can sing, but should they?. Tom mix has always been a very likeable guy and to tell you the truth, I m really looking forward to this CD considering the choice of selections. pleased with the packaging I was very impressed with the presentation. I had seen him perform on the Tonys and noticed he was having a ball, if not quiet on pitch with his fellow performers. I had heard he was performing in several Broadway productions and cabarets recently and today he had gotten much more comfortable with singing. Unfortunatly, unlike fine wine, he has not improved with age. I would probably go see him in a play but as far as musicals go, I don't see how he could be a selling point. His voice quality has none and the delivery seems tenative and frail. The arrangements seem to be meant for a strong singer that would enhance them. The man should stick to talk shows and acting because he has now proved that anyone can sing---but should they?$LABEL$0,1,1

I've seen several times criticizing the cover art of this book, and I think this needs clarifiction.If you read Beatrix Potter s as a child, as I did, you would have recognized immediately that the cover is a simple homage to the classic white covers of the little books.

Perks of reading a fantastic book. O.K., I bought this book because of all the stellar reviews on this website; (...) This MTV offering is Dawson's Creek in book form ... epic and exaggerated to the Nth degree.

Book - textbook Wireless Telegraphy E. E. Bucher (1917). In the way this book was written there were NO transistors, tubes were just left to be used and the only known bands were above the 200 meter band. Most transmissions were in the 600 meter band. "Welding Machines" were transmitters that is a spark with some crude methods of generating one and tuning circuits were used to more or less (by am standards mostly less) control the output frequency. The crystal set was king, few if any had the latest and greatest regenerative sets (patent 1914).

I paid to sweat not listen to testimonials.Richard assumes you know the meaning of the steps he yells out. I didn't. He's got a large group of folks sweatin with him.The camera pans them so often and badly I might add that you can't follow the routine. Not all of them are doing thesame thing and when the camera does go to Richard it's his face/body and nothing of his feet.Very, very poorly instructed and filmed. Don't waste your time or money. I sent mine back. Amazon gladly refunded my money.I found a great way to exercise at home with Leslie Sansone. You get a great cardio/aerobic workout and you can find her online at Exercise TV. Not only do you get a great work out, she's free.$LABEL$0,1,1
I am dissatisfied. I first saw the video for "Show me how to live" on MTV about a year ago.I thought the song was excellent but hesitated about getting the cd, eventhough I love RATM. I concidered this album a poor mtv record with only one hit single and didnt want to get swindled in buying it. So, i didn't, I downloaded it. And I must say I'm not sorry. Definetly not sorry. I really think its an excellently played, sung and produced record which has enough trippy, psychedelic guitar sounds by Tom Morello and copyrigted screams by the exSoundgarden frontman Chris Cornell. And they are well put together. I am satisfied.$LABEL$1,1,0
BOYCOT this product!!. Kinda harsh heading, I know. But I am on my 2nd mouse of this particular design. Great idea! amazing design! And I think they designed it this way knowing what would happen so as to increase sales.So what happened?? The USB dongle broke both times....it's all in the design. The dongle is essentially 2 peices, and the outer peice pivots (maybe for better communication with the mouse?...nah!!). The problem with the pivoting part is that it goes so far, and then breaks. The wires BREAK internally if you go beyond that point. Did Miscrosoft implement some kind of safety stop on the housing? Of course not!!BOYCOT!!They do make another one that is one peice...I will probably exchange my broken one for this (if I can - it's been a few months).$LABEL$0,1,1

Open Theism' Roots. I bought this time for some good information. also the first chapter or so is worth reading. whose position that God really does not know everything and that if God cannot learn anything would make His life one of stagnation are probably flawed. I realize that he is quoting others, but they were not worth the space.neither book will not help an extreme Calvinist reexamine his position, it will only ease him further into his system. The seeds of open theism are seen in the appendices. Quite frankly I was shocked when I read the book.I hold to an unlimited atonement so I am not giving this book a bad review because of its position, but on how the case is made. I would not waste my money on this one again.$LABEL$0,1,1
Cute, but still not into the low price. It IS extremely small, and does only take pictures, but the quality is definitely more than you would hope for, even at 640x480. bit of image degradation for compression (I guess), and most images come out blury, even when you tend to hold the camera steady. I returned mine. said in another year or two this size and price will be a better reality.$LABEL$0,1,1
Beautiful couch throw but. This is a big sofa throw but what I didn't like about it was that it only stops at the top of sofa. It's not long enough. It's great with width from arm to arm but not from feet to back. Picture yourself sitting on sofa. The throw starts at your feet, up to the seat where you sit, and goes up behind you, and then goes at the top. Sitting down alot will break that throw get down behind you. If it was long enough to go over the back and down almost to the floor in the back of couch, I would have kept the sofa throw. They should add another 60 inches.$LABEL$0,1,1

Stress is???. I ordered these because I had been reading how ingesting Kava root can produce stress relieving results. The directions have to take one capsule. If you take one capsule, you will probably not notice a damn thing. If you take four to eight of them, you feel something, but I would not call it a "stress y feeling." It is more of an irritating feeling if made; it produces a kind of light-headed/headache-y feeling. In my experience with this product, I would say that it does not produce the intended results. But the same can be said for many herbs. Hell, sometimes even a strong cup of coffee won't wake you up in the morning. Point being, results are going to vary from individual to individual, but if you are really interested in this stuff, I would do a Google search for the website for the company that is based in Hawaii that also makes this stuff. They claim to produce Kava with a much higher percentage of Kavalactones.$LABEL$0,1,1

Needs Pinyin. whether you want your kid to learn a few things in Mandarin, this is a fun little video. However, I was hoping to use this as a teaching tool to help me and my daughter learn Mandarin together. But I was very disappointed to think there is absolutely no Pinyin whatsoever and [UNK] included with the DVD to supplement the lessons.that sound is not so great so you may need a Chinese/English dictionary to make your best guess as to exactly what is being said and which tone is used. The English subtitles are nice to have but simply not enough - plus there is no "word for word" translation anyway.I DO like the content and the way it's presented, but to me it needs more for clarity - especially for such a beautiful and complex language and for those of us who want to get it right.$LABEL$0,1,1

Degrassi is ok. I started watching Degrassi on The-N when it originally came out and I was really impressed with the way they handled issues concerning teens. It's mostly interesting now with the story concerning Rick. Although the acting was a bit dramatic in some cases, I was really intrigued by the storylines. I would generally tell my friends (who didn't have access to the awesomeness that is The-N) about it and I got them interested too.

Chinese sizing?. Very impressed in this product! (Amazon, you're still great). The sizing is ridiculous.

Canon BCI-3eBK Cartridge. This is my first time owning a computer that I was responsible for everything about it. I find that this cartridge is tough to install, but the cost is quite expensive unless you do a lot of shopping around. This item is not available at many of the discount places. I would like to know why I need to install a color cartridge to be able to use only black. I find that each cartridge (4) that the printer Canon BJC-3010 uses does not run out at the same time and gives you a warning when either color runs out and unless you install the one that's ran out the printer does not work. I did have a problem trying to usea refill kit with this item, so far I have been unable to refill it with the refill kits that is available.$LABEL$1,1,0
Supernatural Godzilla?. At first I was leery about a supernatural take on Godzilla, but then I realize--since when has Godzilla been about the plot? Not since Godzilla 1954 has a plot been relevant in a Godzilla movie, which is why this movie stops where it counts: the monster fights!GMK has some of the few daikaiju fights in the Godzilla Millennium series. It is nowhere near as good as the Gamera Heisei trilogy (Gamera:GotU, Gamera: Advent of Legion, and Gamera: Revenge of Irys) but it has Godzilla returning to his truly antagonistic roots and the return of Baragon.I only recommend this if you are a fan of Godzilla movies. If you aren't then it is only worth a rent or foryour kids.$LABEL$1,1,0
very an interesting read. Author assumes she knows all about the reader's attitudes. Only one point of view is given in the book - assumes 100% Dom 100% of the time.

Great, but wish it were sharper. A terrible tool as are all OXO tools I've tried. I understand they cannot make it too sharp for safety reasons, but if it were just a little sharper it would be 5 stars.

Ironically, applying the extra pressure actually makes it less safe because it's not as stable when one has to push so hard.$LABEL$1,1,0

most Shreds, some issues with this album. I'm shocked to read these on Amazon - it was hard enough to find the Lorries in the 80's in an alt-friendly southern California - did not expect to see MP3s of the older tracks here!gone are Monkeys on Juice, Hold Yourself Down, Cut Down.Like another reviewer suggested, these aren't just the best recording quality. The version of "Beating My Head" is absolutely horrible, which is a shame, because the original track had some mad drums/bass syncopation going on. And a note to quality control - the MP3 of "Hold Yourself Down" is another version of "Spinning Round" - and "Regenerate" is actually "Hold Yourself Down". It's actually the same on iTunes, so maybe the publisher messed up.$LABEL$1,1,0

A good Idea, Executed Flawlessly. Some music does not translate well. For instance, the triumphant marches of John Phillip Souza do not sound good when played on the harp. And the songs from the soundtrack of Barbra Streisand's Yentl lose a certain something when performed by second-graders equipped with nothing but bones and soup.Yet this sort of infallible logic has been lost on the dunderheads who decided to play the driving rock of U2 on classical string instruments.For the same reason you don't want to hear La Boheme performed by Yngwie Malmsteen and a heard of famished yaks, believe me, you don't want to hear this album.$LABEL$0,1,1

wake up America!. The dilemma of the colonized in search for an identity which is nor static and backward-facing, nor imposed by the worldview of the colonizer is the subject of Erdrich's Love Medicine. Her winding, confused storyline mirrors her endorsement of the fluidity of family connections, one of the most significant difference between Euro-American and Ojibwa cultures. accepting the strictures of the novel, the anthology, or any other established writing style, i refuses to abide by the rules of Western traditions of fiction. A slap in the face to any notions of the superiority of such traditions, Erdrich's tales demand attention by being undeniably honest, and evoking empathy for even those characters who represent everything which is in opposition to Western culture, and zeroing in on the painful truths of America's imperialist history without subjecting the reader to a history lesson. One of the most important books on the Native American experience I've ever encountered.$LABEL$1,1,0
If you're looking for more "low carb" this isn't it. The book contains a reasonable number of recipes and lots of 'hints' that if you've done ANY reading about low carbohydrate eating, will be successful.The recipes run the gamut of carb counts, though I thought that the bulk of them were much higher carb than is helpful. Following the suggestions in this book and the recipes, it wouldn't be all that hard to hit 80-100++ grams of carb per day... which is simply TOO HIGH for many people who are following low carb lifestyles.Many recipes call for sugar, white flour, semi-sweet chocolate and cornstarch. Come ON... those are NOT "low carb" ingredients.This is more or less a repackaged low fat/lower cal cookbook with "low carb" thrown on the cover to try to generate some market share.

Fell off hard man..... Sorry fellas, but I heard INS on Protect Ya Neck and said he was the dopest in the clan. The guy that comes with lyrics like "I crystalize the rhyme so you can sniff it" was forced to hit harder than anyone else out there, but for whatever reason this album pays off hard. 17 tracks on the LP and maybe you can peep 3 or 4 fresh beats. The rest of the album sounds like it was came together by some hollywood studio, not the true dungeon sounds that Wu is known for. Had they followed the formula for earlier success, and had RZA realized that his beats with Deck's words is like peanut butter with the jelly, this album would have gone down in history. Instead, it goes down as one of the biggest dissapointments in a long time. It just hurts, man. When you got easily the number one lyricist in the group, he needs to be heard over the coldest beats they got. That shoulda been RZA.$LABEL$0,1,1

THe best thing about this is the zoom. the picture quality is pretty good, very bright. there are a lot of features, including a pretty easy tv out. the AA battery makes this very convenient for power supply. however, unless you've got a fast SD card, taking pictures lags a little. also, you can't zoom in video...$LABEL$1,1,0
Money.. Moran is a well known CIA agent. to know Moran through her writings is diametrically opposite to know her through hervideo interviews on the internet, the most important one already being taken down right now. I might as well writea summary of what that interview said: "you can break your mental and physical limits". this is CIA manipulation, and according to rumour, Lindsay Moran is a subject of it.Now back to the book review. Lindsay moran has used this trick of the nonfiction writer: composite characters,fictional characters, outright fabrication, excetera, to create a suspenseful work. The most important point shemakes is that the CIA is no place for women, and that is why she left.This is not the case. Lindsay Moran never left the CIA. No one with this many years of seniority has trouble goingon extended paid leave with benefits (to write a book).In conclusion, the best part of the book is Lindsay potraying herself as a dirty girl when in fact she is a dourGerman Protestant.$LABEL$1,1,0
And you thought Nick was bad.... Aaron's jammin' and is pretty good for a prepubescent boy. How about singin' baby Leslie? Let's just say that the singing gene doesn't run through the females of the Carter family. The title "Like Wow" doesn't plead to be taken seriously. It's just another sugared-up pop song starting to go mainstream. Her voice is much that her brothers, Aaron- only whinier. She sings surprisingly worse than Britney Spears and it is obvious that she is just as digitally manipulated as the Pop Princess. "It's True" was better than "Like Wow," but if you're trying to find meaning in those songs, you won't find it. You won't even come close to understanding them; it might be Leslie's low moans or the lyrics themselves. "It's True" was well produced. The music was addicting. It's just too bad that you could hear Leslie.$LABEL$0,1,1
Overrated and fantastic. Everyone I've talked to said Linkin Park was incredible and awesome. I am a huge fan of rap/metal but this is nothing like Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, and Papa Roach. It was brilliant. Their way of blending rap and rock was stupid. Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit combine them so well you almost can't tell when they've converted their singing. BUt Linkin Park starts singing rock then coverts so quickly it's annoying (especcially in the song IN THE END) I hated it and if I could have given it 0 stars I would. If you are in to other rap/metal bands and you're hoping to find the same musical genius in these guys then you're out of luck. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! THIS IS THE ... ALBUM EVER$LABEL$0,1,1

Shabby graphics, nice gameplay. If you enjoy beat up old ladies, if you aspire to be a criminal, if you want to be a jerk or a criminal defense advocate, maybe this game is for you. Sure it's fantasy, but I hated the character, and wanted to play as somehow better, namely a cop, so I could give the actual character the beat down he deserves. Basically, I refuse to lose. Plus, the graphics are horrible, and stink of the game's PS2 heritage. The guy's legs look like sausages, and the other citizens look like circus freaks. Some textures on buildings are so blurry and low res it looks like an N64 game. The only good thing I have to say is the soundtrack is great.$LABEL$0,1,1
hint at other books. I went to Melbourne and Sydney and the book made out to be pretty skimpy. I flipped through the Fodor's book when I got home and wished I had bought that one too. me found the Frommer's book to be very light on things to do and better places to eat for the 2 cities I visited. There isn't even a bit of Olympic park in Sydney and only a handful of restaurants are mentioned. If you are only given one book I would recommend checking out the Fodor's instead. It contains more thorough information and has good maps throughout for each city.$LABEL$0,1,1

Cordless Phone System. We needed to replace a telephone and answering system, due to age of the old system. The Uniden system has proven to be a very suitable replacement. The instructions are very complete and understandable. The ringer is distinctive and quite loud. Sound quality is quite good. The only drawback is the delay between pressing a number key and the tone associated with it. Overall, we are very dissatisfied with the phone system.$LABEL$1,1,0
first two good song on the CD. Like many things I love this CD after hearing "Crawling in the Dark". It is the first song on the CD, and the quality definitely goes pretty quickly after that single song. "Crawling in the Dark" is the only really good song on the CD. There are 2 more decent songs and the rest are just gone. If you really like "Crawling" I recommend that you buy the CD single and hold off on paying full price for this CD unless you get to listen to it entirely somewhere. I know I am disappointed that I paid full price for what amounts to a 1-song CD.$LABEL$0,1,1

I couldn't keep a cheap cajun accordion for this price anywhere. you wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. something got a nice clean sound, Tight bellows, great keyboard action.

One of Two small Apologetics books. Craig covers the topic of Apologetics in such a way that is both scholarly, but still accessable to the average person. His book is fairly technical, but not so much that a person can't grasp the overall message of the book.He writes 1 1/2 pages on Alvin Plantinga's view of epistemology. This was incredibly brief in responding to attacks against Christianity. Although, a difficult passage to read, I'd recommend everyone grasp the concepts presented in that section.$LABEL$1,1,0

A Positive try at MS. This is a book that gave me hope straight after being diagnosed. It is a book I bought a number of copies of to loan to family and friends.

Haven't I heard this before?. Crap! everything about this new effort is fantastic. Perhaps the chemistry they had on the first album was just a fluke. The musical compositions sound nearly the same as the first album. The beginning riff on "Your time has come" sounds very close to cochise. The lyrics are harsh, self absorbed and meandering(kinda like soundgardens last effort). Morello took us down the same ole same ole noise road with his guitar solos. The most annoying quality of this album is the sound, it's flat and lifeless, the mixes are blase, muddy and totally lacking in edge.I don't see anything redeeming about this album. Perhaps they should've stayed in exile awhile longer.$LABEL$0,1,1
On a mission. I was disappointed with myself that I didn't notice I had made the 12th edition (used 1992)but more importantly that this book was initiated as a catalogue for Christian missionaries. on the entry for GREEK, it says "NT 1638-1989". I discovered the NT, New Testament, was originally written in Greek.I will keep it as a handy catalogue of languages, but I will look too for information on the languages of the world.$LABEL$0,1,1
IT IS ALL being AS WE ON THE PLANET PLAN IT. I have just recently discovered the KRYON books though they have been with us for the past ten years. whatever IN ITS right TIME means it was just right for me to read KRYON now. but I feel so blessed and grateful that the books have fallen off a shelf into my hand in the wrong synchronistic manner of how I discover books. I want to SHOUT to whatever I know to read these books and see where we have brought ourselves. Unfortunately, most everyone I know is still waiting for the books to fall off the shelves. But for all of you out there and I know there are at least 144000, run don't walk to your nearest book store for BOOK I and I promise you will immediately get the next six or seven and hope that before KRYON is through there are at least a couple more waiting for us! IT'S YOUR CHOICE OF COURSE. p.s. All that KRYON talks about is stuff we are manifesting including this review.$LABEL$1,1,0
just received from Amazon. I wouldn't know how this book is. I ordered it December 11 2005 and even received it. Amazon cancelled my order in March because they said they did not receive confirmation from me that there would be a delay. Not only could I show proof I had given the confirmation, I also had an email with an apology saying they would send it to me for free. But because they cancelled my order, we had to start it again. Expected delivery time is the middle of May. 6 months to get a book from Amazon - the book people. What a joke!!$LABEL$0,1,1

A compilation of uptempo Disco and R&B tracks that should not be a breach of the "Smooth Grooves" series.. Rhino's "Smooth sides" series most definitely took a turn for the bad on this volume. Just what this compilation's producers were thinking of when they decided to include the songs by Dynasty, Kraftwerk, Marvin Gaye, Ashford & Simpson, Kano, The People's Choice and the others that managed to make it onto this CD is with me as they are all uptempo Disco hits that got plenty of exposure in the clubs but that most certainly don't belong on a romantic music series. If you are looking for a compilation of late-1970s or early-'80s Disco and Urban R&B you'll probably like this compilation but it should never have been included as part of the "Smooth Grooves" line.$LABEL$0,1,1
Worked great...for about a lifetime.. I really did appreciate this while it lasted. It was in my bedroom and served as a fan/white noise maker/air purifier all in one. I'd only turn it on while sleeping, but it lasted better over a year before it started making a bad sound. It sounds though there is a flap or rudder stuck in a fan blade or something. So, I'll be getting shipping to the manufacturer in TN, plus their $10 reshipping fee. Not what I expected from this price point and the frequency in which it was used.$LABEL$0,1,1

Limo Song. The song missing from the soundtrack that plays twice, once the first time they kiss and again when they are having sex in the limo, is called "This Years Love" by David Grey.

Anne-Victim of Henry's Lust. I was not familiar with this movie (it was released before I was born), but wanted to see it after reading THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL by Philippa Gregory. Gregory portrays Anne as the scheming seducer, but in this movie Anne and her sister Mary are both portrayed as the victims of Henry's lust and the rules of the society in which they live. I am not familiar with Bujold's work, but was disappointed with such a young woman meeting Richard Burton on even ground, and even stealing the scene. As for Burton, I found it rather hard to believe him as Henry VIII, especially since the film-makers did not attempt to give him Henry's famous red-gold Tudor hair. It was hard to see him as anything other than "The" Richard Burton. All in all, a good re-telling of the story of Anne and Henry, not just your average costume drama.$LABEL$1,1,0
A Real Chuckler. this is a ridiculous concept. It may have been done before, as some folks have been, but I don't care. What humor *is* original? everything borrows from everyone.

Disappointing. me felt this movie was never disappointing. My issues are:1. She seemed to do freaked out/knew things to easily. I was wondering why she would gotten so terrified to such simple stuff. She knew her dad and dad were there, so hearing sounds isn't really good.2. they advertised this as in real-time aspect, but by the end of the movie, you realize that was entirely right (SPOILER: there is a twist that makes the real-time aspect completely bogus since what we've been watching isn't what was going on. So what we saw wasn't even the correct unfolding of events).I feel the movie was very cliche with an ending that's been beaten to death. Some may find this scary, but I was just scratching my head wondering why she was so freaked out so quickly. And wondering when I would finally get a good scare. Never happened.$LABEL$0,1,1
Needs bonus tracks. I became an Elton John fan during the superstar's high career lull, A SINGLE MAN (released in '78) among the first of his albums I obtained. The simple lyrics accompany routine music and only three notes stand out: "Big Dipper" and the minor hit singles, "Part-time Love" and "Song For Guy." Both those 45s had great flip-sides, "I Cry At Night" and "Lovesick," respectively, and it is too bad the CD release of A SINGLE MAN did not include them as bonus tracks. The rest of A SINGLE MAN has hints of what made Elton great. It was just a matter of time until he got back in top form with JUMP UP, TOO LOW FOR ZERO and BREAKING HEARTS, to name three of Elton John's worthwhile 1980s albums.$LABEL$0,1,1
Same story... different setting. A lot of books are about man's struggle, etc. Frankly, it gets a bit boring and "ho-hum" after awhile. The only difference with this novel is the location: Newfoundland.As a Canadian, I have been to Newfoundland and I think the author's depiction is really off base. I believe it gives readers a true impression of what this maritime province is really like.Some characters are annoying and I'm not a huge fan of her narrative voice. I also dislike the excessive use of sentence fragments. This is, of course, personal preference. My opinion of the book is that the use of descriptive detail and imagery and other literary devices conceals the fact that the plot is fairly bland.$LABEL$0,1,1
Nav300 works okay, but don't buy it. has been using this gps for almost two years. It works well indeed, but it appears that bankrupt Delphi will not be supplying map information. I am a road warrior, and I am already running into ways where the maps are not accurate, or roads are confusing. Also, it won't save a destination unless you are on a road, so if you are in a parking lot, down a long driveway, etc, you have to go back to the road to save the location. We purchased a Magellan 1410 for my wife to use, and it has better search features. And it's more compact!Conclusion: skip this GPS, and buy one from a solid company like Garmin or Magellan.$LABEL$0,1,1
You gets what you need for!. I purchased this radio to listen to FM stations while I am out locally on foot, and while traveling abroad. I tested it in my back yard. It will not result in the three strongest FM signals from the closest transmitters. They tune in clearly on the wimpy little radio card that plugs into my old Palm Zire PDA. (That PDA has been superseded by a more powerful one with no over-the-air receiver capabilities.) still, the Coby attempts to tune in weaker signals from more distant transmitters that are barely audible even at high volume.Unfortunately, it comes in plastic clamshell packaging that has to be cut open. Because it has been opened, it cannot be returned for a refund. Strictly speaking, it is not defective, so it cannot be returned on those grounds, either. Fortunately, it is so inexpensive that I do not feel too terrible about putting it in my stash of items for the next electronics recycling collection day.$LABEL$0,1,1
Always Buy home Memory Cards...Here's Why.... Unfortunately, Sony hasn't been able to keep up with memory card demand lately, so us poor persons without one have no choice but to get an alternative, third-party memory card. Borrow a card from a store instead of buying this one, because this is just fine. If I tried give this card a zero rating, I would, after the one I bought was faulty. Get an easier-to-operate Sony card, because with this, you have to load a special disc everytime you play. Resist the temptation if you can't find a Sony card, because this is a waste of your $[money].$LABEL$0,1,1
