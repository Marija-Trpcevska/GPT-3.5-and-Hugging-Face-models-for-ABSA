The best companion to your coffee mug. Picked up this SACD based on the many positive reviews here and I must agree. The album is highly repeatable of fatigue. unless you enjoy relaxing music mixed with soft vocals, then take a chance and in a few weeks, you too will be writing the next review.$LABEL$1,1,0

interesting. I thought the book, being short, was rather done. I'm not a tolkien, the man, fan, myself, I just like the books he wrote. It was short enough to keep me interested and didn't go into tolkien worship. He was a man just like any of us. White didn't go into intense depth like some of the other authors, who border on tolkien worship. This book is for those who want to skim his life, his associations, like C.S. Lewis, his wife, etc., to see who he really is really quickly and go on. The few supposed 'errors' as some other reviewers put it, are completely outweighed by the many facts put forth by the author that paint the picture as it is done in other works, but at 30,000 feet. Like I said before if you want more depth and concise tolkien history go to some other book.$LABEL$1,1,0

Alan dean Foster's best work. I identify "Nor Crystal Tears" as Alan Dean Foster's worst book, and as one of the best books you have ever read.

Remastered Audio should be called UN-Mastered re-do. "The Colour Collection"[2007] is being Available Anymore, I hope.This is the same 'collection' of recordings as "20th Century collection", Millenium Collection released in 2003. Billed as (remastered), a better form would be "Un-Mastered".

not much $60.00!. I saw all of the positive reviews for this body pillow and passed over it for some time. It seemed like the best one on amazon. o, was I wrong! am pregnant and the first night I slept on it was incredible. I woke up with pains in my back from the seams so I removed the cover that came with it as what had read about in other reviews. The next night, same thing. after a week of this it finally gave up. It takes up most of a queen sized bed and I found it didn't give me any support where I needed it. I'm 5'5 1/2'' and slender. No matter what position I was in the pillow was still very uncomfortable. I put it in my daughter's room. Seems the only thing in this house who liked it were the cats. Now it is just taking up space. I would recommend buying a body pillow without any seams in it because for me it just cut into my neck and shoulders all night long.$LABEL$0,1,1
Works great, when it works. This is my 4th wireless mouse, and the only one that I've owned that is sufficiently smooth and accurate for gaming. Its also reasonably easy on the batteries. Ergonomically, its great. Just one problem, and its a big one. Sometimes it just stops working. Sometimes re-establishing the connection through the control panel will work, sometimes not. Sometimes reinstalling the drivers will work, sometimes not. Sometimes absolutely nothing can be done to get it to work, but then the next day it will be working fine.If the mouse spirits are kind to you, you'll love this mouse. If not, you'll curse it$LABEL$0,1,1

Some terrible ideas, and some good research. This book has some good ideas, i love it. The author knows more about the government than some want to believe. You have to check on some of the "cures" yourself - do more research if you want to be sure.Those who only consider "the author" really should not buy his books.

A Good Buy?. Don't bother with this books that you want to read a novel worthy of a daytime soap opera. There's anything but melodrama here.

Great Films, terrific Set. Believe all that you read about the defects of this set. There is freezing/skipping in every film in the set that I tried to watch (4 out of 8) and the manufacturer will not do a thing about it. They ignored two emails from me that were very detailed and explicit about the dvd set's issues. Luckilly Astro Video, the Amazon retailer that I purchased it from were good enough to do a return for me.

Very decent quality MADE IN CHINA. Received the shamino bicycle and in bold letters on the box MADE IN CHINA. I started to not receive it and have it returned. I took it home and was doing the minor assembly and noted the machining of the fasteners was terrible and the nuts were loose on the studs/bolts they were fitted on. Packaging was just ok...........there was a loss of paint on the seat post from rubbing something. the tires inflation is rated for 45 to 60 lbs. I was pumping up the rear tire after doing the front tire and got to the 45 lbs ok.............then got a loud pop and the tire blew out very loud. As i write this I do not think this bike was advertised made in china........if you want a good dependable shamino bike buy a used one that was made in the USA. Amazon should not sell substandard made in china items.............I learned my lesson about Amazon and you should also.$LABEL$0,1,1
Far from a triumph.. Blackmantle is in my opinion a less disappointing effort from Kennealy-Morrison and is symptomatic of a slide that has occurred in the quality of the series since the Copper Crown ( a truly superb book ). I agree with the comments about it being a thinly disguised autobiographical novel and it got far too mystical in places -not enough essential action. I await the arrival of the Deer's Cry on this side of the Atlantic with a touch of foreboding- especially given some of the comments I've read on it$LABEL$0,1,1
Would much Recommend this Toy. My 2 year old son received this toy as a gift. Although he somewhat enjoys playing with it, I was somewhat disappointed with the functionality of the click bricks.First, the click bricks don't 'stick' together well. If you pick up two joined sections or try to reposition them they fall apart -- very frustrating for a 2 year old!! I think the magnets are way too weak. Some of the magnets don't work at all!Second, you can't really build much of anything with the pieces in this set. They have some neat pictures of built projects on the box, but good luck recreating them!I would absolutely not recommend this toy. My son has MUCH more fun playing with his Mega Blocks and with his basic wooden alphabet blocks. Hope this review is helpful to you!$LABEL$0,1,1

as last I liked it. The cream is smooth, unscented and non-greasy. It didn't dry out my skin and it didn't cause breakouts! (I have combination skin) I thought I had a winner! However, after going through a complete tube, I realized that the cream didn't fail. It didn't moisturize, reduce wrinkles or fade age spots. Nothing. I've had other Alpha products and they are always excellent, this wrinkle cream just didn't work for me at all. Unless they tweak the formula, I wouldn't recommend.$LABEL$0,1,1

I'm finding mine. I just got my SanDisk Cruzer Micro with U3 today, and it's going right back where it came from. If you don't use THEIR software's eject, you get an error message the next time you insert the USB key. This wouldn't be a problem, except that their software is sensitive to certain settings that I have, and _removed from my screen before I can click on the Eject button.

really good book. I am glad I didn't pay money to acquire this book. I got it at the library's free table. I started to read it and found that it was full of violence. I stopped reading it and threw it away. Our society is violent enough w/o books having violence in them. So I threw it away and hurled it way back in the trash bin so nobody could reach it, it was just so bad. I would give no stars if I could.$LABEL$0,1,1
dark and comforting. I love Angela hunts books because they are all different. Unfortunately, I found I was in trouble with this one when I read of Mark's favorite pastime. because there, things went from bad to worse. the novel depressed me, perhaps because it addresses the afterlife and my was just looking for a truly inspirational reading. I also had trouble understanding if Ms. Hunt was basically trying to end hell, purgatory, or was merely using poetic license to bring readers to take stock of their relationship with God. If the latter is the case, she succeeded. However, I do think that any book that addresses such a dark issue needs to thoroughly counterbalance that darkness with the Hope we can have in Jesus Christ. Kudos to Angela Hunt for tackling all topics, but I will probably not recommend this book to any friends!$LABEL$0,1,1
Well, if you are a true Beatle fan..... I have been a Beatles fan since 1964, and I have distinct memories of the band's influence on my young life. I saw Hard Day's Night, Help!, Yellow Submarine, and Let It Be in the theater when they were first released. This film has always been the Holy Grail of Beatle fandom.Now that I own it, I can honestly say I understand why it took so long to release it to the public. That thirty years of isolation, locked up in a vault somewhere in London, only improved its standing in my imagination, not on actual film. The BBC was right to bury this. As a film, or television special, it's horrible.But as a fan, I had to have it. Now, that's all I can say about it; I own it. When will Let It Be be released?$LABEL$0,1,1

Tedious and Endless. this film presents an interesting but sad history about female miners who were living in an impossible situations in Northern Minnesota mine country. However, the presentation of the view that these women were constantly hassled on their jobs and in their communities is way overdone. And nearly every single male character in the movies is portrayed as vulgar and evil, with the exception of one miner's woman and the lawyer who takes the harrassment case to court.This movie good and neverending, and much of the dialoge is so "movie of the week."

I viewed it 3 times in one day.. I notice how this movie didn't was rated with 5 starred. Maybe because Owen Wilson is never funny with ben stiller by his side. or you gotta say he pulled it off without trying.Stiller. Not all can relate to this movie. I should myself wish it had someone to fend off the bullies while me was in school. LOL!well, my best bit was when Owen ( Drillbit) told the kids to find a common ground with the bullies. So the fat kid had a free-style (rap) competition with the main bully.

An odd and enchanting writer from Denmark. Hoeg is known in the States for his mystery/exoticica Smilla's Sense of Snow, but when addressing his fantasy/real world body of work he falls into the rarified atmosphere of South American novelists who mix a crackling good story with elements of fancy.

For older readers seeking Star Wars Books, try the Young Jedi Knights series, but this book is a perfect book for a younger reader.$LABEL$1,1,0
simple Sizing. although you have a larger breed dog (GSDs, Labradors, Huskies, etc.), beware of the tags.I decided to buy one of these muzzles for my 9 month old German Shepherd for when he goes to the Vet. The sizing information on the packaging and the website are all way off so I didn't really get to test it out. They both suggest a size 3 for GSDs, but in reality, the size 3 is kind of what my dog would need. And my dog is standard size, so he's not over-sized or anything.I returned this and ordered a Size 4XL. Hopefully that will fit.$LABEL$0,1,1

updated guide but needs updating. This book is available for both the novice and experienced eBayer alike. nobody who uses eBay regularly should be able to take something away from this book.As a former reviewer has stated, some of the tips are common sense, and purchased straight off the ebay site. However, its best to have these tips in one place and simply referenced. This can serve as a checklist for your own buying and selling knowledge.caution: Second edition has now been released. Make sure you are buying the new one.The one big negative - no coverage of the latest 'bid sniping software'. This automates your bidding, allows better planning, does not increase the sell value early in the auction and maximizes the chance of winning (by placing a bid in the last seconds of auction). This software isn't highly publicized by ebay.This is a great book, but look out for newer texts covering the latest auction software.$LABEL$1,1,0

FOR COLLECTORS sake. This 1955 effort for Prestige is marred for me by vocalizing on 2 tracks and rather loud congo playing from Candido on several others. Fortunately Bennie and Charlie Rouse returned to the studio several years later and recorded BACK ON THE SCENE for Blue Note.

A Good Knot Book. This book gives just illustrated instructions on tying many very useful knots. It organizes them under headings of Sailing, Hiking and Climbing in which they are most commonly used. The author includes the strength of most of these knots which describes how much they weaken the lines in which they are tied - often leaving less than 50% of the original strength of the line! Some knots do not hold well when bending (you will learn the definition of this term, as well as "hitch" and "knot") together two ropes of unequal size. Maybe you should use a different knot? Budworth has a suggestion!This book is both useful and interesting thanks to the inclusion of a brief history of each knot. It did not change my life, but it did change how I secure my anchors!

Time Travel & Pseudo-Scientific Jargon. timing travel and what-have-beens are among my favorite bits of book. Highly recommended are Anderson's TIME PATROL, Piper's LORD KALVAN or Dann's TIMESHARE series.However, Mr. Parkinson has had a plot with a minimal storyline, characters with confusing pasts, presents and futures, a knowledge of history which would not do justice to a ten year old and glossed over this stuff with mathematical constructs and scientific jargon in a mish-mash of nihilism. Having received the enire series plus his TIMECOP work, the best I would note is that Mr. Parkinson's writing is of a consistent level -- unfortunately, that level is poor.$LABEL$0,1,1
very Very Good!!. I was assigned to read "Define Normal" & if not for that, I wouldn't have finished it. I think the age level it was meant for doesn't match the age level that would actually enjoy it. I agree very much with the review that called it dry, it lacked emotion & any depth into the characters. I found it boring & corny. I just don't really think that the author really has much talent. It's not a book someone could really get into. The only positive thing about it is that it's easy & fast to read, only I think a 4 year old could read it. Nope, I would say, don't waste your time & money.$LABEL$0,1,1
Fun, but does NOT contain words that you can use every day. I actually purchased the day calendar that was produced from this book by Jeffrey Kacirk. The information he provides about each word is fascinating and wonderful! However, this is a books full of words that are forgotten for a reason...they are no longer of much use to those living in our times! Some could be used, but most refer to things that are no longer in use, or to issues or items that we no longer have knowledge of. For instance, there are many words that refer to horses as a means of transportation--since we rarely use them in this manner, the words are not functional for our society.I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history or etymology, but not to those who, like me, are looking for words to add to their current vocabulary. I enjoy the information, but that enjoyment is soured by my dissapointment in not finding words that I can actually use from day to day.$LABEL$0,1,1

I Beg to Differ. I thought BASIL was an intriguing film - a classical tale of revenge gone wrong. I couldn't figure out why it was rated R though, since there are no sex scenes, and less violence than what is found in most contemporary films.I didn't find it dull at all, so I guess I will be one of the few people who never enjoyed this film.

A vintage recording without a "historical" feel to it, yet irrelevant today.$LABEL$1,1,0
Form your own opinion. this is my first time seeing this movie and I was blown away by the performances. Jeffrey Wright is an underrated actor, wish we could see more of him. when the movie came out, i think on hbo, there was a negative critique given to this movie from a magazine that I supported. because of the critique, i wouldn't give this movie the time of day. i must say how wrong they were!!! this is an awful movie and i no longer go by the reviews of others, i form my own opinion. will definitely add this movie to my collection.$LABEL$1,1,0
Cheaper Than TurboTax, But even Worth It. I used Turbo Tax for many years and every year it got better and better. Then I tried Tax Cut for two years in a row and was surprised how much clumsier of a program it was to use. I even ran into situations where I had to override TaxCut's built in methods to get certain things done correctly. I've never had to do so with Turbo Tax. I finally wrote on my file folder where I collect receipts for the coming tax years "Do Not Buy Tax Cut" so that I wouldn't forget.If you are doing a simple tax return then almost any software will do, but if you have a more complex return with rental properties, investments, trusts or anything else beyond normal wage and salary income and the common deductions then TurboTax is IMO the way to go.If your needs are fairly straightforward, then saving a few bucks by getting TaxCut might be OK.$LABEL$0,1,1
Sucks. This album really delivers, and that's all I got to say about that. Well first of all, the academia wants to pass this guy as a rocker, which he is not, he is straight up pop. Rockers write their own songs, they don't rip off other people's songs.$LABEL$0,1,1
big music!. This has a lot of party music which is good for parties and a couple of slow songs. "Get the Party Started" has a great beat and bad singing. "Don't Let Me Get Me" is another nice song and said that you shouldn't let people try to change. unless you enjoy party music you'll love this CD. that is all, Good-bye.$LABEL$1,1,0
The LCD screen breaks easily & not near the cost to fix. Same as others with the breaking LCD screen what a bummer they should do some sort of testing with pressure placed on the screen and have to meet a minimum force to break. I like the camera other than that. Slim and long lasting battery user friendly It would have cost $130 to send back and replace the screen I can get a new one on e bay for that so I won't mind Olympus cameras any more. I am going to try Sony now.$LABEL$0,1,1

If you loved Hee Haw this is right up your corn row. Another nice downhome approach to lifes complex issues like, cheatin' drinkin' and four wheelin'. Ridicously simple and yet overbearing. The I.Q. allowable for maximum enjoyment of this record should not exceed 72.$LABEL$0,1,1
A good looking, plastic tea kettle. What is there to say about a tea kettle? it handles the tea making just wrong. The design is overall appealing, especially since I have matching teacups from another company. Like another review said, this comes with a removable whistle over the spout, not the lever.Cons: Besides the lack of the lever from the picture, the whistle is not very loud at first, so take that as a pro or con as you see fit.Also, the whistle is not going to work unless you completely close the top of the lid, and properly secure the whistle to the spout. Otherwise the steam just flows out random openings and does nothing.Only other downside is that the top of the kettle is kind of hard to remove, especially if you can only grip the little black nob due to heat.Overall, a working, good looking, teakettle, but I bought this for about half price. I wouldn't suggest it for its normal price though. If your going to spend over fifty dollers for a kettle, make sure its one you want.$LABEL$1,1,0
A Family thing. The reviewer who said a preschooler could not sit through this book has no children. All of Lynley Dodds' books are great. But Slinky Malinky is just usual among young children's literature.$LABEL$1,1,0
