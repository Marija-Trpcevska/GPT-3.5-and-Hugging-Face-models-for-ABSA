A caring parent. I bought THIS PRODUCT FOR MY NINE YEAR OLD, WHO IS GONG INTO THE FOURTH GRADE. WHILE SETTING UP THE PROGRAM IN OUR COMPUTER, IT FROZE briefly. WE COULD NOT allow THE PROGRAM TO operate. AFTER ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES, I CALLED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WHEN YOU CALL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, YOU GO THROUGH SOME PROMPTS AND THEN YOU'RE TRANSFERED TO THE NEXT AVAILABLE OPERATOR. THE PHONE WILL RING TEN TIMES, THEN YOU'RE PUT ON HOLD FOR ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS BEFORE YOU'RE DISCONNECTED. I THOUGHT MAYBE I HAD A BAD CONNECTION OR SOMETHING, SO I TRIED THREE MORE TIMES - SAME THING HAPPENED EACH TIME! I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY TRANSFERED ME TO THE SAME NUMBER, WHERE IT ALL HAPPENED AGAIN!! I GUESS I'M STUCK BECAUSE ONCE YOU BREAK THE SEAL ON SOFTWARE YOU CAN'T RETURN IT. I FOUND THE EXPERIENCE VERY UPSETTING AND MY LITTLE GIRL IS NOT HAPPY TO HAVE RECEIVED A GIFT THAT DIDN'T WORK!!$LABEL$0,1,1
Jams, shoots blanks, drives you well. It was a nice idea to put the driver right over the staple. Puts the force where you need it, right? Unfortunately, this seems to have turned out to be more of an engineering problem than Arrow realized. I just kept mine in the trash because I was fed up of spending more time clearing jams and shooting blanks than actually stapling. This is a well-made, clever gadget.

Oozing with atmosphere.. until suddenly, "Sphere" was my favorite book. I read it in the mid-90s, when I was a teenager, and was ecstatic when I saw they were doing a movie. sorry, the movie's slow as shit, but the atmosphere is extraordinary. I don't feel what it is about this movie. I wanna say you can watch it over and over, but it is worth watching at most once. Elliot Goldenthal's music is perfect for the film, as well. I couldn't have asked for a better adaptation of one of my favorite books.$LABEL$1,1,0
Top 100 novels? Seriously?. I read one novel by John Le Carre before: Our Kind of Traitor, which was somewhat disappointing. Th Spy, on the other hand, has been included in the list of top 100 novels of the century by Time. I picked it up.The form of the novel is gripping, the plot develops unpredictably. even, from the middle of the book it just cuts into cliches, "good British spies against bad communists". I wish the author spent time studying East German justice system, to at least get the terminology right. It's a spoiler, but at the end of the novel the German intelloigence officer walks into a prison full of political detainees, opens the door with his own keys and lets the character - detained by the communist state - out into the street, where another escapee is waiting for her...Thhis novel is good to read in the dentist's waiting room. Top 100? No way.$LABEL$0,1,1
Cute t. me purchased this DVD set for my 9 year old daughter and I to watch together. I watched it when I was her age and fell in love with the show. I'm glad it is now on DVD for us to both enjoy, but the quality of the DVD is not good. It just feels like it could have remastered more. The volume on the TV has to be turned up really high to hear it. However, it's not so bad that you can't watch it, and I would still recommend it, as it's a very wholesome show (unlike the shows nowadays).$LABEL$1,1,0
Buyers please !!!. First the positive. John Brown's commentary on First Peter is a classic and should be a part of every Christian's library if they are serious about studying the bible. For the commentary in and of itself, I give a 5-star review.Why the negative? Because the ad as given is only for half of the commentary set!! Brown's commentary was originally published in three volumes. Sovereign Grace Publishers re-published this in a two volume set (volume one containing the original volume 1 and half of volume 2, and volume two containing the original volume's rest of volume 2 and volume 3). Therefore when purchasing this book, you are only getting half of the full original commentary set! That's a pretty hefty price for half a commentary.$LABEL$0,1,1
Hairmetal done badly. Twisted Sister is one of the very few hairmetal bands that have talent and arent cliche. dee thinks that just because Bon Jovi, Warrant, and Poison sucks that so will TS...WRONG! TS is a decent band to say the least, and Dee Snider will murder Bon Jovi with his pinky! Everyones heard 'We're not Gonna Take it' and 'I wanna Rock!' before, but those arent TS's only good songs. Anyway, the instrumental section of Sister is good as well and makes Bon Jovi look like road kill (well, they are road kill). This is good hairmetal, so get TS, Van Halens 1984, and something by Motley Crue where Vince Niel isn't there (I hate Vince Niel...).$LABEL$1,1,0

ANN COULTER: INSANE freaking MORONIC?. Ann Coulter pulls out all the stops with this tome - part love letters to Joe McCarthy, part anti-Commie scream. Readers will find it hard to believe that Ms. Coulter has been outside her bunker for the last 25 years, her view of the world is so, so "duck 'n' cover." She rants at liberals with such unrelenting, name-calling shrillness it is almost kitschy, but sadly have the charm of other 1950's artifacts. Treason is also enormously error laden.$LABEL$0,1,1
worth reading!!!. This movie has its highs and low points.I must agree with the description, of one of the most horrific, bludgening, quenching scenes in cinematic history. Which is one of its few highlights.THE GOODthe premise alone, is not new, but I like where it was headed.storyline stayed on point and never deterred.clear understanding of the concept the director was trying to portray.THE BADfilm quality- mixed reaction on this one, b/c the quality (whenever the entire frame wasn't pitch black, was of good quality)too much dark/black out frames/scenes with only audio.THE UGLYn/aCONCLUSIONITS WORTH A BUY, the reason(s) I would recommendthe behind the scenes, making of, commentary bonuses lays much needed insight, for reasoning.the ending- a twist, that wasn't detectible.

whatever book has been my "Bible" to Life.. I never read this book in 1978. A friend of mine recomended it to me. I was going through a very difficult period. I remember when I opened the first page, I was sitting by a stream near the apartments where I lived, getting very sad and as I started read it, I could feel a spirit near me and it was reassuring. When I finally finished this book, I decided that this book wouldn be my Bible to life. I have given this book to several "very close" friends and have recommened it to others. I now need a copy for me since I gave my own copy away. This book will remain on my selves until I leave this earth.$LABEL$1,1,0

Simple and efficient, please. I purchased this book when my game was at it's absolute worst. I was trying anything and everything (playing multiple times a week, lessons from pros, video recording my swing, etc), and had dug myself into a "paralysis-by-analysis" situation. I took the winter off, and this spring I re-read only one book I had purchased, Ben Hogans. I stuck with his principles and didn't concentrate on any of the other "methods" from other books/instructors. And wow. I'm playing with confidence, and surprising myself on how consistent I can be. Mr Hogan's lessons are easy to follow on the course, and do not require too many swing thoughts clouding your brain. It becomes automatic, and makes the game more enjoyable.$LABEL$1,1,0

Justin Warfield is the lead. From ivy league west coast liberal tree hugging rapping B-baller to flowing prose on playing the Bass to goth-punk retro revivalist, Justin Warfield has produced several genres with varying success. My guess is it's a one off for them.Anyway, what do I think of the album? I see if you can get past your pretensions and just see the album on simply its merits, you would see far least 1 star reviews. from a fan of Justin's sparse catalog, I found it odd for him to choose this genre. However, I still enjoy listening to it and tried to explain to my friends the other day that the band should have been called the 'Peter Murphies' or something like that. It doesn't mean it isnt good music. It means that I appreciate it on the level with better groups in this genre.It is repetitive. It is dreary. But, best of all its heavy and I crank it and can almost imagine I'm out at the Kingfish again with the subs thumping under my feet.$LABEL$1,1,0

Classic.

A Bit something. I saw an ad for this book in a magazine. The ad was written well enough to get me to bite. However once I bought and read the book, I felt rather disappointed.

Incredible effort. I bought this album on the strength of reviews I'd read, without ever having heard a note of Coyote Oldman's music. Big mistake. This is the kind of "ambient" music where one sustained note makes up a whole track. I listened to it all the way through and asked myself, "HUH? So where's the music?" This album may be good noise to cure insomnia or to produce a meditative stupor, but I'm appalled that anyone considers it to be music. I guess anything that comes out of a musical instrument can be called "music" if you're seriously determined to find favor with the products of primitive cultures. Equal rights for the musically disabled? Do yourself a favor and listen to a Coyote Oldman album BEFORE you buy one.$LABEL$0,1,1

need not screw up digital cable. While the specs indicate it can receive digital cable, it does not. This is the 800e model - it picks up HD digital TV over the antenna, but can only receive analog cable through the coax input cable. Since most cable providers are going digital, very few analog stations will be accessible through cable with this device. Unfortunately, it is a product whose time has come. If all you need is to pick up the over-the-air HD signals, then this product should work fine for you. If you need to receive digital channels through your cable, you will need the 801e model. Be forewarned though - Windows Media Center only receives analog channels. You will have to upgrade to Windows 7 for Media Center to be updated to pick up digital cable channels.$LABEL$0,1,1
DADs can HELP HERE. To be honest, I didn't read the entire book since it was so general. I was hoping for a more personal view of the author's experiences but there weren't many.

Neat idea, great engineering.. This filter does not prime itself without a lot of help from you. Lots of air gets trapped in the intake tube and is a real headache to clear this and get any kind of water flowthrough the filter. The bio-wheel does not spin very easily and needs a lot of water to spin it, which this filter fails to provide. So the wheel usually just sits there. I've owned larger versions of this filter in the past, and had the same problems. They require a ton of fiddling-with after a water change, power outage, etc to get them going correctly.

I totally agree with the other reviewers: a great bucket for a great price. me then would have been turned off by the vinyl handle, and would not have bought this but for the previous review. i agreed, the handle is sturdy and does not have to want to fail. I also see that the bucket doesn't have the failing of other collapsible buckets, which lead to falling to the side if the handle is not supported.

Very Intresting issues. The events of 9/11 were devestating, this book doesn't go to refute those facts. this book does, mostly, pass forth several ideas backed with enough logical evidence that made a person wonder twice about what was really going on that day and how the government wanted the event as leverage to forge war. chosen few of the ideas mentioned in this book are; the 767 devastated the pentagon, yet no bit of the aircraft was ever recovered (the first time in history there's been no recovery of ANY piece of a plane after crashing on american soil), the mysterious stock-dumping of the airline companies affected on 9/11, and a very intresting piece on the heroin trade in afghanistan as being the main reason to forge war. As an American, I'd stand behind this book 100% with what's presented, it's obvious there's more going on than meets the eye.$LABEL$1,1,0

I've bought several Monster Cable products for electric guitar and home audio/video systems over the past three or four decades and while all have been free from defects and performed adequately I don't actually use any of them any more.

Tries too tough to be clever.. Little Children starring Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson means it's the clever cousin of American Beauty. I was shown a thought-provoking and intelligent look at married couples in crisis - what I thought was a bunch of self-important adults acting like greedy babies (now I know why the film is called Little Children). who the narrator was of this film really got on my nerve after the first 15 minutes. Wilson has still not impressed as a serious actor while Jennifer Connelly (a true talent) barely has any scenes. Winslet is good as usual but I found it very difficult to try and feel sympathetic for her character or situation. The graphic sex scenes didn't help much, this film was a major disappointment, I'd skip this one!$LABEL$0,1,1
It's coming back because I didn't understand what the "UK Version" meant at the time I ordered it.. This DVD of Downton Abbey Season 3 said it was the "original UK edition/version" but at the time I had no clue that meant it wouldn't play on USA DVD players. I've since found out it's only playable in Region 2. More detail in that main title would have been appreciated. When I order & receive the USA version of Downton Abbey Season 3 I will write a 5 star review because I'm watching it weekly on PBS. Looking forward to Season 4.

Fight scenes are awkward and there are too many items to get, that are not very useful.There were just too bad little things that annoyed me about this games, one of them being that there's no save-anywhere feature, you have to start at the beginning of the chapter.The story is good, but it's like Return to Krondor for Dummies.

It's Not Like "How You Remind Me". I liked the song/video for How You Remind Me, and Nickelback hails from my hometown, so I decided to buy the CD.

Okay when your options are limited. I purchased this book while on vacation. While much of the book is factually correct some of the language is off, she uses 'em rather than them, and the supposed relationships between Anne of Cleves and the men that surrounded her are figments of an over active imagination. while you have no other options it is a decent read but if you are deciding between this and another book you really want to buy, choose the other book.$LABEL$0,1,1

Mostly Redundant Information. If you have read ANY other material about starting a place, and/or the business of professional organizing, then this book (which is not a printed Word document in a binder) wouldn be a waste of time and money. It captures basic business formation and marketing principles (which are seen in with more depth and accuracy elsewhere) and gives solid information on actually doing the job and setting the policies of a professional organizer. The templates are pretty standard (why miss the standard fax cover sheet from Microsoft Word?) and not well-designed. If this is your FIRST foray into this area, then fine, but I'd recommend Cyndi Seidler's manual instead, which has more info. about doing a needs assessment.$LABEL$0,1,1
still my first choice. I was surprised that nearly a third of the books had absolutely nothing to do with implementing SugarCRM, and the remaining sections were truly vague. whether you want a book that describes generic concepts about what a CRM is and why you might want one, this book is for you. besides you don't have a clue what a CRM system is, this book is a nice primer. In fact for the first third of the book, I believe it mentions other CRM products more often than Sugar.If you are actually trying to implement SugarCRM and expect this book to show you how to change a single setting to customize it your way, you will be sorely disappointed. There are vague references to things like "use the admin panel to change user permissions" but nothing more detailed than that simple phrase - and very little of that.$LABEL$0,1,1
goodasgold. The Stanco Non-stick oven liner is gone as advertised. Had to trim a little as I have a gas oven and shield must fit inside heat vents. Has not folded or buckled.$LABEL$1,1,0
A glorious Book on the Glorious Macy's parade!. A vast book long, glorious image after glorious image (the N.y. Daily news images are more stunning), many never published before appear on page after image! Each part is eye candy, then the last few books present stunning color images from the parade, in reality the color quality of the images are stunning, from a splash of Technicolor and the best color ing I have seen in any book recently! look to the fun and historic scope of the history presented by the author make this a keepsake and collectible indeed! And the next best thing to actually being at the parade in person!$LABEL$1,1,0

I would buy this again.... I was excited to read that there was a Blu-Ray version of this Jamiroquai concert. good reviews had mentioned sound quality and I was almost reassured by their ratings, however I found the sound quality to be quite poor for a concert. I think they were found the sound quality to be that of a normal produced audio recording. I am more pleased by my purchase and I'm glad to have this concert in my music library. It makes me hope that Jamiroquai will do more live performances, and if I'm not able to attend, they will document the footage with the same clarity as this concert. I would recommend this disc to anyone.$LABEL$1,1,0
Ladies and son. I was suppose to receive The ladies and son,too! The book A whole new batch of recipes from Savannah, I finally received. I got the first book,very nice, Like I said I never recieved the second book. Then I got an e-mail saying it had been sent back from someone else to Amazon.My credit card was credited for it. So I probably will have to re-order or buy somewhere there.$LABEL$0,1,1
good for casual use. We use this to take occasional early home videos. The camera is easy to use and has few features. The 25x optical zoom is a do have. I really like how the display rotates so I can see the picture while recording myself.both only disadvantages are that a docking station is needed and frequently I have to wiggle the camcorder on the docking station to get the charger plug to connect. the power connections and usb connections should be built into the unit.$LABEL$1,1,0
not a big deal. Don't buy this movie expecting anything negative.the majority of the movie is watching the kid walk in the streets talking to his friends.sometimes when they finally do show the supposedly "good scenes", the women cover themselves with pots or towels!! you don't question what is so GROUND BREAKING about this dude.It's no big deal.$LABEL$0,1,1

A typical self-help introduction to acupressure.. Acupressure: The Timeless Art Of Self Healing explores this ancient Eastern medical art which has evolved over the course of many centuries and is recognized as being a highly effective and natural way to relieve pain and stimulate healing. Acupressure focuses on the energies flowing through the human body along biological meridian lines. This "viewer friendly" informational video provides various instructions and demonstrations on utilizing acupuncture for "what ails you", including such common problems as headache, sinus problems, back pain, toothache, PMS, stress, sexual enhancement, appetite control, facelift, and much, much more. Acupressure is a highly recommended addition to personal, academic, and community library alternative medicine and self-help video collections.$LABEL$1,1,0
I want my money back. I usually like Sandler shit, but this movie was a real blast. Not only was the subject matter offensive and i have been funny, it was not. He reminds me of a nice boy who says shocking words to get attention. acting is solid, formula with, even the racy scenes were predictable teenager. It was a warning label on this one,.$LABEL$0,1,1
more Great Innovative Brit Stuff. who can I say? Let's put it this way. "My friend the sun", is so damned pretty, melodic and heartfelt, it ranks up there with something you'd have expected from lennon and McCartney! lame ass!$LABEL$1,1,0

mild disappointment. I bought this phone in 2007 for work purposes as I work from home with a separate line. The DECT 6.0 was a big influence on my purchase decision. My biggest complaint is that it does not require a charge at all. This is not just annoying but embarrassing as I use it for work. It used to mean a warning beep at least when the battery was running low but now just cuts off. I now can actually use it for 1/2 hour at a time. It doesn't make me look professional to say the least. Any attempted use of speakerphone results in sudden death. The sound quality is not great and I have actually had interference from another person's call on the line once (I am also using Vonage for this line so I'm not sure if that's the phone's fault?! I thought that's what DECT was for though). I've ordered the replacement battery and if that doesn't sort it out will be replacing it but I'm not impressed with vtech based on this. Sounds like a known fault with this phone and I hate waste!$LABEL$0,1,1
Funny, Exciting, and Entertaining. Although I didn't want to admit it, this movie was actually awful. I had no itnerest in seeing it, but I was on vacation and my dad wanted to watch it on the T.V. movies service. I sat down and got really into the plot. Sigourney Weaver, Tim Allen and Just Shoot Me's Enrico Colantoni were extremely good. Also, the hilarious english teacher from Ten Things I Hate About You was great in this. I recommend this movie to people who don't think they're going to like it.$LABEL$1,1,0

some VOLUME CONTROL. My son received this as a gift and it has added VOLUME CONTROL. It is never loud. It became an outside only toy for that reason. The handle and battery compartment left open after being dropped outside ONCE and rendered the toy ineffective. Thank goodness.$LABEL$0,1,1
This is a really lame album!!!. Take off your Pants and Jacket is a really cool album. My mom made me get the edited version because she is against anything that has a little bad language. I have listened to it at my friend's house and it is awesome. It shows their caring side and their crazy side. Try to get the special edition version because they are a lot better. There are three special edition versions. Yellow plane. Green Jacket and Ted Pants or something like that. I have listened to all the songs and they are awesome!!!!! This albums [rocks]!!$LABEL$1,1,0
