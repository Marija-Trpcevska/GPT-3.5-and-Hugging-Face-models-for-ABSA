perfect Scoop Ever, Cute Case. Whoever designed this has originally scooped a cat litter box and has no clue about how this scoop wouldn't work for doing such a thing. Anyone who likes this scoop must not realize there are other scoops out there that would make the job 1000 times easier.The angle of the scoop is all wrong so you can't really get any leverage. It's no wonder to read reviews about the scoop breaking. It's just not made properly to be a scoop. The scalloped edge in the front is another design flaw that leads to a poorly designed useless scoop.My poor arthritic mom has been struggling with this scoop for months, not knowing she could be in less pain and get the job done quicker and better if only she had a good scoop.I wish I could give this product negative stars for the pain it's given my mother.$LABEL$0,1,1

a couple of minor rarities. this compilation has an edited version of "Figure Of Eight", which I believe is the same as the actual version. There are two rarities on this CD which are worth the purchase to the serious collector; "Party Party" is a dance number, sounding pretty much from the era it was recorded in (late 1980s). "I Wanna Cry" is a slow, hard driving blues tune. Fairly sure these tracks were recorded during the "Flowers In The Dirt" sessions, since this disc was released around the same time. This was originally issued as a radio promo disc, and is indeed a rare find.$LABEL$1,1,0
Holes Is authored / By:Munadi Grade 6, Brooklyn!!!. My Review of Holes is that Holes is all about a kid named Stanley Yelnats is made of stealing shoes but he didn't, but Zero did and then he dropped it off a bridge, and it landed on Stanley. Stanley fell with the shoes and the policeman thought that he stole the shoes from the homeless shelter. So, the police caught Stanley and put him in the military camp called Camp Green Lake. And all you have to do there is just dig holes to find a mystery object that only the evil warden knows about. This book teaches you a lesson: Don't ever steal anything because you might end up in a place like Stanley was, or maybe even worse...$LABEL$1,1,0

more up to standards of Denise Austin. I've used Denise Austin items for centuries and have been happy. I was not happy with this videos. hers pace was too quick and she did not give instructions beforehand. There was a chick on the video who was doing the "modified" version but she didn't realize that too well into the program. She does change quickly without notification and with little instruction in "how to". not disappointed. I would advised that anyone buying this video sit through it first so you can see the changes. It is not a difficult one if you are just starting out, just confusing and it does accomplish its purpose.$LABEL$0,1,1

I'm not insane!!. I remember watching this flick when I was about 10 years old over at a friend's house. This was a sit on the edge of your seat and hold your breath movie. At least at that age it was. However, as the years have gone by (I'm 25 years old now), I have found it nearly immpossible to get this movie. And of course my cohorts must be thoroughly uncultured, because it is even more remote to find someone who has actually seen or heard of this movie. So I'm in a record store a couple of years ago and decide to take a chance and see if they carry it or can order it and lo and behold..... This flick DOES exist!! And NOOOOOOOOO, they can't order and break my heart in telling me this. Now if only I can bide my time long enough to get my hands on a copy. My kids are gonna love it!$LABEL$1,1,0

i. to make my review meaningful, I am at a disadvantage because I did not own a Kindle 1 before I bought the Kindle 2. will read many Kindle 2 reviews of customers who owned the earlier model I knew of many of their negative comments.I love my Kindle 2. I find it works great even reading in bright sunlight, but it is not so good reading in limited light. below the negative comments from those who previously owned a Kindle 1 was that Amazon advertised that no book would cost more than $9.99. Obviously, many books do cost more than that.

Over-rated. This game is a puzzle game. I personally feel that the reviews are too over-rated for what it's worth. It's kind of like Bejeweled except you can only line up blocks vertically, and not horizontally, which kind of bothers me. There's not really a storyline ... it's not incredibly fun, but will probably last you a fairly good ten minutes of game play. It's really the effects when you line up the same colored blocks and the sounds and graphics that give you that "high" of the game.$LABEL$1,1,0
How to Gett SSI & Social Security Disability. Mike has the better of intentions but... it's obvious this is a self published book with a very clever writing style. As a previous SSA worker, he has a lack of useless SSA 'speak'and loads of equally frustrating insider buzz words. Large print is annoying and want to takes up space because he has so much to say.

good size but fit is hit or miss. We have a few of these. In different sizes. They go together sometimes. No idea why the first step is knocking out plastic parts. They couldn't do this? Otherwise assembly takes about 60 seconds. We have several of this size box and some have tops that fit perfectly. Others have tops that are too deep and the lock hole doesn't line up. It is weather resistant but not water (or insect) proof. Even when perfectly assembled there are small cracks between the pieces that allow small bugs to enter. So not for dog food or anything like that. Stuff inside stays dry. Also, if you use a lock understand that the lock is just aesthetic.

Asleep at the Watch. Immerse yourself once again in the seafaring adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin as they roam the almost unexplored oceans of the early 17th century, and participate in the bittersweet "liberation" of Chile. The 85 year-old O'Brian's flawless dialogue and meticulous attention to detail makes this book -- like the rest of the series -- a historical tour de force. Unfortunately after 20 previous books, Aubrey and Maturin have few surprises left, and hundreds of pages filled with the impenetrable politics and minutia of daily naval life may be as stupefying as Dr. Maturin's regular doses of laudanum and hellebore for readers unaware that a great naval battle invariably lurks in the closing pages. O'Brian addicts will welcome another chance to visit their favorite characters, but people new to O'Brian should visit the earlier, fresher books of the series -- say "The Far Side Of The World."-- Auralgo$LABEL$0,1,1
wow. When purchasing this book, I expected to read about rodeo and native american life with a little romance. I did learn a lot of the native american way of life and enjoyed reading about it. The romance story line was great, but not incredible. The only mention of rodeo was towards the end. When the author misinformed the readers and wrote that the flankstrap used in the roughstock events is tied around the animals testicles. This is untrue. The fact is that the strap is used as a conditioning tool and does not harm the animal at all. In fact, some of the animals used in saddle bronc and bareback (which are horse events)are female not male. The author needed to get her facts straight or left rodeo out of the book completely.$LABEL$0,1,1
Haunting. After spending a summer alone, Akilah can't wait for her best friend, Victoria, to return from Nigeria (her country of birth). She's excited to start fifth grade with her fun-loving friend.But Victoria comes back a different person. She is subdued, unsmiling, and imposes a new rule on Akilah: "No laughter here." After their class views a puberty video, Victoria reveals the truth to Akilah: While she was in Nigeria, her mother had her circumcised, to make her a "pure" and "clean" Nigerian woman.Shocked, Akilah struggles to do the right thing. She is horrified by the ritualistic cruelty to which her friend has been exposed, but her own family has always taught her to revere traditional African culture. Together, Akilah and Victoria try to accept what has happened and re-learn how to laugh.Rita Williams-Garcia won the 2011 Coretta Scott King Award and Newbery Honor for One Crazy Summer.$LABEL$1,1,0
wake up to natural healed. Hellinger teaches her readers how to take matters regarding their health into their own hands, literally. The author has apparently deduced and presented the lowest common denominator for your ailments. She writes about two natural methods that would save millions of lives during the flu season: the "Hellinger Hiatal Hernia ting Self-Help Technique" and the "Hellinger Life Saving Technique of Manually Boosting the Immune s." These techniques, which the author discovered and honors, allow you to circumvent drugs and medication that can destroy and handicap the body's natural healing dynamics. Celebrate: once you've healed naturally, it's forever. You must believe in natural healing for this effective process to work.I healed myself from decades of struggle with adrenal exhaustion, chronic fatigue, and fibromyalgia.

Great topic, should have ended far better than it did. Overall the book wasn't a bad read. The topic of exploring some of the sinister aspects of the Catholic world I found very appealing - especially as I am one ! Unfortunately the book started out promising much but in the end turned out a bit of a fizzer. I was left feeling a great deal more could have been done with the topic - to be honest, the ending was superb. However, to the credit of Mr Case (whomever that may be) it certainly makes one want to head off and find out more about the subject.$LABEL$0,1,1
keep this player if you like classical music. If you like to listen to CDs where there is no break in the music between 2 tracks, add this player! I like to listen to classical music, and often I will program only a few tracks, e.g., to listen to one symphony on a CD with multiple works. The way it is designed, there is a break when switching tracks, so if you're listening to a movement that spans several tracks, you get a "skip"!If I'm listening to an entire CD, it doesn't happen, but it's horrible if you're listening to part of it.I've talked to the company, and it was hard to even explain the problem to them - I guess no one there listens to classical music (or other albums with continuous music) anymore. Their only suggestion, after weeks of discussion, was to take it to a repair shop. Given what I've read elsewhere, I suspect I've stumbled across a design defect, not something that can be fixed.$LABEL$0,1,1

Complete burst of right ear bud after two weeks of use.. I came across these to replace some cheap earbuds I got from the grocery store. I found these and was pleased with the price and the good reviews. I read some of the bad reviews, and noticed a lot were about this very problem. I thought to myself, "Oh, they probably weren't being handled well". That was definitely not the issue. The fizzle subsided while I was on a trip, while the earbuds were in my ear. This was very upsetting. I found I could get the sound back for a while if I bent the cord a certain way, but it would simply go out again. They have great sound and fair noise cancelling while they are working. The problem is they don't last long. These are not worth the fifteen dollars I paid for them.$LABEL$0,1,1

Attractive, but interesting. . .. While this is an attractive teapot, I am disappointed by the expense of its construction. First, the glass is kept thin; also, the lid does not sit tightly on the body of the teapot.

We hated it. My mother in law originally bought this book for my son last year (age 2 at the time). He LOVED it. We read it year-round. Unfortunately, he got sick on it in his bed in the fall (yes, he even looked at it in bed!) and we had to throw it away. Luckily, Santa brought him a brand new one for Christmas this year. He is 3 1/2 now and instantly remembered the book and has not put it down since. My 7 year old daughter also enjoys it, too. Of course, being 3, he likes to do a few of the same pages over and over, but i try to get him to try a new one occasionally. ;)$LABEL$1,1,0

sharpen your axe, Simon. another colossal point. Readers and seekers of factual evidence have a difficult time discovering reliable science, which this literature does not represent. A scientist or researcher cannot have an agenda other than developing a fair postulate from sound facts. Good research includes all that is found first, and then confining tests to rigorous and sound analysis. reason does not do this, as so many pseudo scientists do. This kind of researching falls in the same category as Erich Von Daniken's "research."It's a real pity that people of any faith will cast their beliefs to the wind without first establishing the validity of an author's premise and examination methodology. They are however, of like minds, who look for an excuse to rationalize the abandonment of beliefs over a seemingly unsolvable conflict of ideas.$LABEL$0,1,1

This reference is good. Check it out in a store before buying it online. This book is written much differently than the Harvard Med Guide to Men's Health (which is an excellent book and a good read.) I am a health professional and I was disappointed to find that this book is indexed for use as an alphabetical reference and it is written in (too) simplistic language. Moreover, the explanation of where the research and conclusions come from (large research studies like the Nurse's Health Study, etc.) is absent. As a desk reference, this is a weak resource and as a comprehensive summary of Harvard Med conclusions, it also lacks cohesive, integrated organization.$LABEL$0,1,1

Same Name - Different Product. As of November 2005 Amazon is shipping "Version 5" of the WRT54G. Thing is - it's a completely different product than they've been shipping for the past several years. Whereas Versions 1-4 were incremental tweaks to the hardware, Version 5 is a completely new entry, with far less RAM and running a completely different operating system (VxWorks). All previous versions ran Linux and were known for their high quality and reliability, as well as the ability to use upgraded firmwares. See other comments here and on other linksys-enthusiast sites - this new version is a turkey. It may be selling under the same name, but it's no different than if Mercedes started selling a Kia witha a trident hastily slapped on it.

Full of truth.... When you do not come from an Arabic country, reading this book might be extremely horrifying because of the events that take place in the story. However, if you are an Arab then you know that the events stated in this book will never occur. Saudi Arabia is a country, it has rules and laws, and there are many mnay laws that protect women in Saudi Arabia regardless of what this book says. Many of the information about the Islamic religion is false as well. If you want to read a book to get a sense of what women's lives are in Saudi Arabia and the Arab world then do yourself a favor and do not read this book! Our lives, thank God, are wonderful. We have our rights, and we are equal to men. There is no law that demeans women in the Arabian world. I am an Arab, I am a woman, I come from an open-minded society (Kuwait), and yet I am strongly against this book because it does not speak the truth.$LABEL$0,1,1

Battery using mouse. Works as intended, but Logitech says in manuals to expect 4 month of battery life from mouse. I'v owned product for about 6 months and changed the mouse batteries 3 times so far, less than 2 months per change. so very "green". listen, I can afford the batteries, but--call me deluded--I expect more. Logitech has work to do ...$LABEL$0,1,1
Another exact Star wars soundtrack. First of all, I d begin to point out that I do not own this exact soundtrack but the older collecters edition. I am writing the reviews on here because the reviews for the other soundtrack are for the film, not the score. I highly doubt that there is any difference in the music below.John Williams' final installment to the star wars soundtracks is just as bad as the previous ones. The epic fleet music to the Emperor music is fantastic. This score is a bit darker than its predecessors but that's a good thing considering the story involved. There is a lot of great music in here that should please just about anyone.$LABEL$1,1,0
A Little Book on Basset Hounds. A review of: Basset Hounds A Andrews and McMeel gift bookFirst of all, this is a whole book measuring only about 3 inches by 4 inches, but it's interspersed with interesting and useful information as well as the predictably adorable photos of basset hounds. It starts with an informative history of bassets then gives a detailed description of the "breed standard", the characteristics judges use at dog shows. Then there's very practical advice about choosing a puppy, caring for and bonding with your puppy and some general information about training and care. There's still a lot to know about raising a dog that isn't covered in such a short book, but a surprising amount of information is included between these tiny covers, and it takes at most half an hour to read it all.$LABEL$1,1,0
Hilarious. you made the DvD because I was curious about the whole falling out that The Game had with G-Unit. I was impressed at how the the Boroughs of New York supported The Game and shunned G-Unit. The Game walked around New York Talking to people (Something that 50 can not do without getting Robbed) asking them how they care about 50 and G-Unit and it was not good. The Game actually had jokes which called the DvD awesome and funny.$LABEL$1,1,0
souvenir doll. Sweet porcelain doll in blue dress was purchased as a souvenir for my granddaughter who appeared in "Cinderella" in our local community. My granddaughter loved the doll, who came with her own doll stand, and represented the work she had put forth for the play. This doll is a "character doll" and not suitable for play for young children. It is fragile.$LABEL$1,1,0
Surprisingly right. Perhaps I expected too much, but while this book is amazingly comprehensive, it is also amazingly good. Almost every entry is filled with opinions - how does one separate facts (an encyclopedia is supposed to have facts in it, right?) from Gray's perspectives? It feels like reading something from a freshman writing seminar.$LABEL$0,1,1

Improbable characters that work. what else but Elmore Leonard could come up with a phony priest and an ex-con standup comic as his hero and heroine? I'm guessing the Catholic Church left its marks on him in one way or another because he's had Catholic characters in other books, most notably TOUCH and BANDITS. I went to Catholic school, and the title PAGAN BABIES alone was content to stir memories and draw me in. (And a tip of the hat to the person who thought to put a mission box on the cover. Perfect!) Leonard unfolds this story of scammers and scumbags with a deft hand, giving us a generous helping of his signature humor and bull's eye dialogue. No one writes like him, and thank God he's so prolific. The man is a national treasure.$LABEL$1,1,0
Good Enough To hear Me Playing. would have to worry about batteries or re-charging batteries anymore. Since it's narrower than the original ones, the material is expected to be cheap too, especially for the buttons. and if you're just going after something that will work and prevent you playing then this should do. The wire is long enough but I put a USB extension cable to yank it longer and reach as far as I want to.$LABEL$1,1,0

Looking for something efective. check the product because last year my dog, a wonderful big Golden Retriever had a serious desease from ticks, and the products we had been using did not provide good enough coverage for ticks. Have applied it today because I just came back from the States and will see if it works.....our vet s it's very good, so we hope the dog will be appropriately protected and able to go to his everyday walk, everywhere.$LABEL$1,1,0
see Alienation. The book is a good guide on tracing the evolution of the notion of alienation in theater. playing separate route from the naturalistic theater tradition, alienation aims at "extracting" emotions in theater and sticking with the message and aim of a play. Peter Thompson's work indirectly traces the idea of showing that acting is just plain "acting". He does this by reviewing the various experiences of staging stage classic "Mother Courage and Her Children". For actors dreaming to just plainly "act" in theater (acting a character and not being a character), the good is a good guide. For those dreaming to be the mother in Mother Courage and The Mother, Shente in The Good Person of Setzuan, and St. Joan in St. Joan of the Stockyards--learn from this book.$LABEL$1,1,0
A bit overwhelming. Ladder of Years was my first experience with Anne Tyler. I was only mildly shocked, because I thought the development of the plot was a bit thin. The book encompassed many real-life situations and emotions, but Tyler was too rich in her descriptions. Tyler left too much to the reader's imagination, which made it a bit difficult to really connect with the characters. It was a constant guessing game throughout the book as too what Delia was really feeling. It was almost impossible because of lack of description to decipher the real reason for Delia leaving, and whether or not she was justifiable in doing so.$LABEL$0,1,1

Emancipate Us.. This cd is bad and the re-release promises to be better. It's worth the price just for the 5 videos you will have...Then 4 new songs.. What a package and Mimi fans don't mind at all..Heck it'll make a great gift for someone else if you already have it.$LABEL$1,1,0

passing through you like water. Tori's music is never reflective of her life, like any artist. about the same time, an artist periodically explores techniques to add to their base of knowledge. Tori always injects these things into her music...that is what makes her the acclaimed artist that she is. To Venus and Back...the new material...is more about atmosphere than clear expression of emotion ... more dependent on Little Earthquakes. I like the fact that the words and their meanings are not so immediate...they too become atmospheric. She is masterful at the use and combinations of sounds and uses her voice more instrumentally here. I am a big fan, and this recording (live set is excellent too... those pining for "the old Tori" will appreciate it) is as great as all her other ones.$LABEL$1,1,0
