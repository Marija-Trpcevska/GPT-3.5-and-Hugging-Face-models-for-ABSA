Read 'A Good Man is Hard to Find' to understand this movie. This movie is a grisly fairy-tale, Little Red Riding Hood with all the gory details of the wolf's attacks and his death by axe. The child is the key to the story. The violence is so exaggerated as to be a horrible parody. The line the male killer makes (who has no name by the way) at the end about the little girl is everything. A very dark comic parable. Don't take its over-the-top violence seriously.$LABEL$1,1,0
Sorry, but it's true. four stars. I love the book series, but the movie was amazing. normally my family thinks the books are boring and that I have a lousy sense of good reading. This was the only thing that I got could get my husband interested in reading the books, but he slept through most of the movie. I am sorry to all the hard working people.I don't think you should make any movies of the other books . I have read #'S 1-6 and can't wait to get # 7 in soft. Please, if you read this, do not skip the books. THE KIDS books are not as good, but they have different characters and stories. PLEASE USE YOUR MONEY ON THE BOOKS. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT THEM DOWN.$LABEL$0,1,1

Shrill propaganda for software anarchists. Useful, but not terribly original, getting undermined by smug self-congratulating boosterism.

"Only for cult followers...". The real time you follow Harvey getting drugs, using drugs, placing bets, and doing other bad things while on duty. It's difficult and painful to watch; I can only give it point for its "right there," documentary-style camera-work and Harvey's effort in portraying the character. Rent it first to everyone if you want to buy... But be warned, Harvey will do an anguished, tormented whine/cry of agony that will stay with you for 3 days at least...$LABEL$0,1,1
An adamantly advised acquisition. In Rules Of Civility For The 21st Century, Henry Wheelwright has assembled a compendium of two hundred rules of civility drawn from submission by some four million Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts across the country. The rules of conduct were sent in by boys for themselves and others after reflecting on the rules that President George Washington copied out for himself as a youth of 14. Also provided for the reader is a Civility Workshop addressing modern threats to civility and keys to character building and leadership. Line illustrations enhanced Rules Of Civility For The 21st Century, which is an adamantly recommended acquisition for every school and public library in every community in America.$LABEL$1,1,0

Good Product money wise but not Safe. they am very much impressed with the quality of the Leather pouch from my new Treo . I was very happy of the same . once While traveling as it was hooked to my trouser , my Treo jumped down twice from this Pouch . As it does not have a Locking Facility , It creates a Problem .

Probably the closest you'll get to hardcore on her.. I had a friend show me this a while back and believe me this isn't hardcore or anything, but its a lot closer to it than Girls Gone Wild. There isn't any actual Sex in it but it does show a LOT of vagina. Don't get your hopes up yet though. Most of the girls aren't that hot and a lot of their vaginas aren't the best looking either. ESPECIALLY the chick on the front, Kobe or whatever. Hers in the worst. But if you're desperate and actually want to fork over money for grade F quality "pornography" than by all means.$LABEL$0,1,1
nice stuff.. This vacuum sucks! I mean that in a negative way. It has excellent suction. Does a great job on carpets! it would give it 5 stars, except that: 1. It's a mess on the heavy side; 2. the electrical cord isn't designed to retract; and 3. the switch on the vacuum that turns on and off the rotating brush for when you go from carpet to bare floor (and vice versa) doesn't seem to work. It keeps springing back to "ON" position, and doesn't click to stay "OFF." I considered returning it, but when I checked the floor models at local stores I noticed that they didn't work either. I thought I knew how to flip a switch, but perhaps I'm suffering some sort of skill deficiency here. There must be some trick to it that I haven't figured out yet. I will be checking courses at my local Community College for switch flipping, and keep you posted if I find any.$LABEL$1,1,0
The fix is in!. get doing a lot of BackGammon in my days but this stuff goes the cake. The dice are loaded in the computers favor.

Scandle, sex, and anything. I hardly really was all that interested in the whole henry VIII thing but I was given this book and just tried reading the first couple of pages. It totally has a way of engaging you from the begins. so the beginning mary is only a little girl involved in this smaller than life role she has to play. you follow her along with her exciting work, and just when things start to cool off for her, you became lost on her sister. I loved reading how nasty the author made her. I know there are legends of how Ann really was a royal pain. The author did a good job playing it up. It really is quite long over 650 pages, but you wouldn't know it, I read it in 6 days. Its really a page turner. It really only portrays Ann, and Mary in depth, and I liked that. I also liked how the author depicts an aging, baby of a king who likes to get his own way. In the end the author does an amazing job wrapping up the looses ends to the already known facts making this history/fiction story a great read.$LABEL$1,1,0
no masterpiece. Of course he never wrote an autobiography, but if he told it to cronies, it would sound like this, then he'd have them shot. So imagine Stalin telling his life story, a crude thug boasting of his power, telling little anecdotes about exterminating millions, and sharing his innermost "thoughts". It's black humour at its most. Lourie is a sovietologist and literary translator from Russian, he's done the research, spent time in Russia, he knows his stuff. It's hard to imagine a more accurate portrait of the monster, and once you start reading, you can't put it down. Should be required reading, lest we forget. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,1,0

A little tale of a young Irish-American Boy .. This book by Dennis Smith is a sad prequel to his Engine Co. 82. In 82 we saw a young man dealing with the job he has chosen for himself, and a difficult job that was. In Song for Mary we see the boy who became that man. The only way a man could become a fireman is if he had great compassion for humanity. Mary, his mother, gave him this compassion. The "Song" of the title resonates throughout the book with the haunting refrain of The Rose of Tralee. I thought this memoir was as good, if not better, than those of Frank McCourt and others which have filled the bookshops recently. A MUST-READ for anyone who cherishes their Irish-American heritage or if they came of age in New York City,$LABEL$1,1,0
Kinda sucks to play - but has nice visual effects unseen in any other game.

Decent--Could be Much more. I have read several Koontz novels. It seems like we are beginning to see patterns from previous novels(i.e. dogs, TICKTOCK(actually another book), supernatural, warped personalities). I feel like I have read a similar story from previous stories written by Koontz. I think the dog piece is a stretch. The explanation of Bryan was another reach for the reader. I didn't feel the characters and their interaction with TICKTOCK was a good fit. I would recommend the book--but if you are a Koontz fan--you have seen this type of story before.$LABEL$0,1,1
how is Mystery science Theater 3000 when you really need it?. Extremely awful Keanu Reeves was that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades. Keanu goes once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking amazing performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that. Only his co-stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare but not even their great performances can salvage this disaster.

No frills at THE BASE. THE BASE is an overall fine film. Clearly the actors' talents are not put to full use. Mark Dacascos' excellent martial arts skills are supressed to appear like a good street fighter, not the impressive military weapon he is suppose to portray. The story line is interesting, but is weakened by the poor ending of this action film. The good guy wins, but it is a dismal victory. The nudity added to The Base does not really flow with the story line. The director clearly failed in this film. The acting in this film is very good, but the camera angles were not. I'm sure the actors were disappointed with the final product. THE BASE is worth seeing once. I suggest renting versus buying.$LABEL$0,1,1

Good for some, not others.... There are two different types of Madden player. Some go for accurate simulation and detail, others go for creativity and solid presentation. If your likings fall under the latter of the two, prepare to be bitterly criticised.true, it is true that the gameplay is amazing. Player likenesses are unmistakeable and the action is great. However, those of us who want more from their Madden think this game to be empty and gutless. There is no Create-a-team, create a stadium, or create a fan feature that has been such a great part of the recent current-gen Madden games. The 'create player' function is a joke, and franchise mode has VERY little to offer. You can find all of these features by picking up the game for 10 or 20 dollars less on the PS2, XBOX, or Gamecube. 360 fans deserve better.$LABEL$0,1,1

Pass this one by.. I bought this keyboard to replacement a malfunctioning Gearhead keyboard. or I started having problems right out of the box. Keys did not have. The mouse has to be within 3 feet of the receiver AND the infrared system has to be pointed at the receiver. this feel of the keyboard (shape of the keyboard and curve of the board was very excellent. However the plastic is very rough and tough, almost feeling like it's recycled. I don't worry it will survive being dropped even once. I find it interesting that the keyboard signal is RF but the mouse is infrared (and therefore line-of-sight only). Why 2 different systems??No more cheap keyboards for me.

library book on Java networking. The book covers general topics. For background material, it covers TCP/sc theory, security, threading, exceptions, and streams. under the actual networking part of the handbook, it covers client-side and server-side networking, URLs, datagrams, multicasting, RMI, CORBA, Servlets, and Message Streams. despite other words, there is a wide range of topics covered.The book is full of old code examples. I especially enjoyed one like the finger client and the dns client. These are real world examples that will be extremely useful if I ever need to implement these protocols using Java.One error that I noticed was that it mentioned that the source code from the book was available from two web sites. In reality, at the present time, it is only available from the first one mentioned.Overall, it is a book that is worth owning and has the broadest coverage of any of the Java networking books on the market.$LABEL$1,1,0
Oshima-san, konnichi wa!. I bought this video just to see Tokyo beauty OSHIMA HIROMI (in Japan, surnames come first, but she's "Hiromi Oshima" to "Hakujin"), and she doesn't get me in it.

Nicole Whitehead is sexy too, but her scenes aren't as good as some of the other girls. Coleen Marie is rather sexy with good scenes. Tailor James and Stephanie Glasson aren't bad, but they fall far behind Hiromi and Pilar in my book. I never watch any of the other girls besides Hiromi, Pilar, Nicole, Coleen, Tailor and Stephanie.

Romance without smut. I hate this book. A woman is in a car crash and thinks she is going go die. She promises to "do good" if she is allowed to live. You then get to see how she goes from a self-centered, rich person to a truely caring, helpful one, and all the bumps that go along with it. Her family thinks she is losing it (her mind) because they don't understand why she is changing. The people at the country club don't understand. It's a very enjoyable book. There is romance in it, but the sex scenes are not explicet, which I truely enjoy. It is nice to read a book that doesn't go into detail with the bedroom scenes and leaves something for your imagination.$LABEL$1,1,0

Very clean and punches very nasty holes. looking at some of the 1 star reviews, I was a bit worried to order this and tried it as soon as I checked the package. I am on a diet and so so had to punch 3 extra holes on each of my belts. every one, when used, on a wood base, punches verey professional holes with no result. Two hammer strikes and there you go. admit it.$LABEL$1,1,0
keepin it real. Yo she was an o.k. singer, but she was no acter. who new c.d. was wack and everyone knows that. Just because she is no longer with us everyone feels the need to lie and not keep it good. She was tight nahh I'm lying, she was wack and couldn't write a song at all. I think every hit song was written by someone else. She truly did tell the truth about her and R.Kelly, that is when she was tight. RIP---Aaliyah$LABEL$0,1,1
No wonder this has been discountined. I'm a creature of habit, so I kept buying this specific earpiece for my cell phone, since I liked the way it was designed. Small, simple, and I didn't have to look like someone from "Star Trek" with that dumb thing blinking in my ear. It works well, and has excellent sound quality both for my voice and the earpiece. What I liked is there is this rubber "hook" that keeps it in your ear, and is very comfortable. However, every one I've bought (and I've bought a lot of them) has the same problem which is the "hook" breaks off no matter how gentle you are with it. So then you have to sort of stick the earpiece in your ear, and hope for the best. For a while they were very cheap so it wasn't that bad, but now they are hard to find. Soon they will all be gone, and I'll have to find something else. So should you.$LABEL$0,1,1
A Familiar Overview of The Middle Ages. This book provides an approachable overview in story-telling narrative form of the re-birth of the quest for reason during the Middle Ages of European history. It offers very few which is not already known by anyone familiar with the period or the history of the Roman Catholic Church and its grip on the intellectual development of the European culture at that time. By all means read it if you want a good overview of this strange time, but keep in mind that it is an overview and at the 30,000 foot level.One complaint I must register here is the choice of title. There is very little here about Aristotle or his writings, or his thought. if you are interested in that seek the "Cambridge Companion to Aristotle."$LABEL$0,1,1

1530 - new and improved model is definitely not an improvement. however, here it is, July 2005, and I have the 1530 model. who also bought it from HSN. It also delivers 5-6 months. Of course the warranty is for only 3 months. Pure awesome. I will never buy a Cyberhome product again. I wish I could put back the compliments I gave about it the first 2 months that I had it. It worked great in the end, then I experienced all the problems that everyone here has mentioned. I have noticed that many stores no longer carry this model. Maybe there were just too many complaints.$LABEL$0,1,1
does work for me. I bought this pan because my cat squats right inside the door to her regular covered litter pan, hangs her bottom over the edge, and pees on the floor. I bought a pan with a high side but she still can't keep everything inside. I hoped the Clevercat design would prevent spillover, but Ginger just bypassed the middle step and peed directly on the floor when confronted with this product. I tried it both with the top off and on, and it didn't seem to make any difference. It looked like a good idea, it just didn't work with my cat. FWIW, she's sixteen years old - a younger cat might take to it more readily.$LABEL$0,1,1
No real plot. I enjoyed all the books in the series. Blake bunch until this one. The other reviews that gave bad ratings have already explained the problems with this novel and I don't wait to repeat it. I tried two times to get this book and decided to read half only. It is so good with no plot and the usually charming characters (Anita, Jean-Claude, jonathan) have turned into perverted psychopaths, completely unlikable. I wish I never forgot this book and only kept the earlier as a pleasant memory. I wont even look at any more books from this author.$LABEL$0,1,1
better product. I'm just satisfied with the sound quality and comfort of these earphones. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair. They do a great job of blocking outside noise. set price also.$LABEL$1,1,0
see little whistling kettle. This whistling tea kettle heats enough water to make two 12-oz cups of tea, hot cocoa, etc. The whistle starts as a cute little chirping sound as the water begins to create steam, then progresses to a rather loud, sharp whistling that you just can ignore. The easy-fill opening is very nice, too. Don't overfill, though, because you'll end up with a hot, wet mess on your stove top.$LABEL$1,1,0
Customer support is superb. has worked great for several months. When Skype did their software the Vosky sofware was not compatable. online customer support offered several different solutions, but thus far nobody have known.Each time you contact their customer support, you should fill out a new problem report form. me am about willing to throw Vosky in the trash.$LABEL$0,1,1
Great movie, just couldn't watch it at home. I guess I missed the fine print about the format of this particular dvd. I was unable to play it on my home dvd player. So, I had my money. If Amazon is selling dvds with different formats, then putting the particular format in big bold letters would have prevented this sort of thing.$LABEL$0,1,1
Protracted and interesting. This is the first of six kits, each equally priced. I found the method to be fraught with language cues that were too syrupy to swallow ("popping above the line", "solution sandwich", "lifestyle surgery", and "tender morsels"). Doing cycles are at the heart of the program, a process that, for me, lent itself more to manufacturing emotion vs. excavating damaging shadow beliefs. I passed up dropping out, and feeling much better for it.I'd recommend saving your money on this one. Try Martha Beck's Joy Diet instead.$LABEL$0,1,1
PIXIES please!!!. I really enjoy all the stuff Pixies create, and the songs of the classic DOOLITTLE are all high points in Pixies career!

GOT IT right. I haven't purchased this album, and i probably won't because, as has been said, it's too expensive. however, i know all these songs because i bought all the singles as they came out! If you get them at the right stores, they are much cheaper than this. try newberry comics, or any other local non-franchise store that you can find. 10 songs and 40 bucks?
