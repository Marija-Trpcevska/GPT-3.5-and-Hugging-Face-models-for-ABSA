Sound great but amazing. i not last.. I tried the cheaper in ear noise cancelling Sony earphones and they broke in a very short amount of time. I figured the more expensive version would be more durable. I WAS WRONG. These broke in an even shorter amount of time - 2 weeks. $50 is a lot to spend on good headphones. I guess Sony makes all of their products disposable; portable CD-players, stereos, etc. Sony customer service also sucks. Pray you'll never have to deal with them. Better yet, just don't buy Sony and go with Shure. It is more but worth it because it will last. Buy from a company that doesn't believe in disposable products.$LABEL$0,1,1

well for serious Akkerman fans. I bought this as a CD in 2012, forgetting that I had owned it as a vinyl LP in the late 70s. If I had remembered, I would not have bought it again. I DO like the final 7 short songs of the album: some blues-rock that sounds improvised; also a jig and a couple medieval pieces that are cool but not as well developed as some similar works that appeared on Focus 3, Hamburger Concerto, and Akkerman's album Tabernakel. HOWEVER, the first cut, "Fresh Air", is a tedious, 20 minute example of one of those 1970s unsuccessful attempts to elevate rock music to a higher art form. Yes, there are some impressively-fast guitar licks which are instantly recognizable as Jan Akkerman. But, otherwise, I find the song unlistenable; beginning and end are dreary, noisy chaos in between. Quite a bipolar album!$LABEL$0,1,1

I DON'T THINK SO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. This book has struck me! You know why? The author is sympathy to the hijackers of Flight PK 326, especially Arshad. My family and I were aboard that flight and I can bet you by their actions on that plane, that they do not deserve less sympathy. If that's not enough, all the book is written on heresay and facts that, in no way, the author could have witnessed. This book is a sham. Do me a favor and take your money elsewhere.$LABEL$0,1,1

Don't start reading this series.... as this is mostly a well-written series, do not read it until the author has the full set of books completed, which at the rate he is working will be in about 10 years. He is already about 4 years behind on the next installment (A Dance with Dragons), and two more novels are supposed to be added after that. Just on content, this book is worth 4 stars, but the lack of completion for the series ruins it.Also, be sure to note that the content is for adults only, with some sexually explicit material.It also seems that the latter books in the series tend to ramble, making me long for the more concise, action-oriented content of the first two books.$LABEL$0,1,1

i Pet Bath. I love this pet tub. Not only is it cute but my Teddy Bear Hamster hates it.please put any sand in it yet. I just wanted to see how he would react to it and he's been climbing in and out of it all night.When I first opened the box and took this Chinchilla bath out I thought it was huge and that I would have to return for a refund.Then when I measured my Hamster I realized that he would never fit in the smaller one. A dwarf Hamster yes, but not a Teddy Bear.My Hamster is nearly 6 inches long so he'll have plenty of room to roll around in there.Seller/Store chooses the color. Mine is yellow.It's about 7-3/4 inches tall not including the ears.

Wake Up Simmons, your product need doing.. about my 59 years as a farm boy and then an engineer, mine seen some poorly designed products...and this one require some work. our water quality is so excellent but my hydrants sometimes begin to weep after it is shut down. I was sold these with the assurance by the sales people that the working/moving parts could be serviced above-ground. g. the stem was so well stuck that I was sure that my was going to break it if I pulled any harder. So I reassembled the unit and worked the handle and adjusted the tension until it finally quit leaking. That is the last time I've used either of the units. Now these exist as legacy waste on my farm and a lesson learned. Don't buy these unless you want to dig them out of the ground after 3-4 years. Bad Product.$LABEL$0,1,1

OK product, decent seller. I received my turntable in, what I thought, perfect condition. "Super Saver Shipping" is actually USP ground from NY, which takes all of eternity and then some, to arrive in CA.The turntable itself looks sturdy, but I haven't been able to test anything else, as the needle it came with was BROKEN.

Don't use this cd - It grows on you!. I first heard about this CD on the Radio. Our local AM station that plays standards was playing "It's My Life" (the Bon Jovi cover). It was such a great arrangement that I didn't realize it was a cover until the song was almost over. I was so impressed that I bought the CD the next day.I am a big lounge/standards collector (mostly LP's) and this CD is a great fit to my collection. What impressed me most is that Paul took this project seriously, it's NOT done tongue-in-cheek.

The Revenge of was a good Halloween film.. What happened? This film saga was lame until this one came out. I admit it was decent, but thats no excuse for bad acting, bad plot, and no jump or frightening scenes at all. the plot is boring in a way. Michael returns after jaime when shes in a mental asylum. some film was poorly seen and poorly written, and the characters are so great you dont care if they die.

Not one-touch. I bought a Maxtor product assuming that it s function as the100GB and 200GB products that I had purchased previously -- walk upto a PC, turn on the Maxtor, connect the USB cables, and it's done.originally, since this terabyte drive came pre-formatted for a Mac,I had to install their software, re-format the Maxtor, and thenit became a "one-touch" product.Maxtor should sell products that are consistent with their originalphilosophy, i.e. sell a "one-touch" drive in two editions -- onepre-formatted for the PC, one for the Mac, and whatever otherpre-formatted flavors.It's nice to tinker with computers and hard drives, but as an end-userI expect the product to be useful out-of-the-box. That's why I wasloyal to the Maxtor brand.Unfortunately, a one-touch product it's not.Other than that, it seems to be working fairly reliably as mytertiary-storage device.$LABEL$0,1,1

Die fighting... to finish this book!. I'm female, so maybe this is just a guy's book. I always like a good hero, and Jack Reacher qualifies as such, but I certainly am not interested in paragraphs-long descriptions of the geophysicalities of bullets as they traverse through the atmosphere. this and other testosterone-laden information really comes well into the book, so I plowed through to the end. I couldn't suspend disbelief in order to believe that any human can discern the difference between 1.4 seconds and 2.1 seconds (as it relates to the time it takes for a bullet to travel). I believe it took me 3.7 seconds to scan through each page to a part that I could tolerate reading until the end of the book, which fell flat.$LABEL$0,1,1

Hitech - AC Adaptor brand (converts european plugs to US Outlets). We bought a rubbish fan in Spain last summer to provide some ventilation in a warm room some friends in Madrid were letting us use as we traveled around from one venue to another. It was so efficient that we decided to make room for it in an extra suitcase we had to buy to get the things we acquired in Spain home. This adaptor plug looked just fine in doing what it was designed to do. However, be aware of the fact that your appliance without further adaptors to change the current from 110 to 220 will function at about half the speed! Of course, you could plug your appliance into a 220 outlet if you can figure out how to make that work.¡Buena suerte! (Good luck!)$LABEL$1,1,0

Richard is the better. This isn't his best.. I use this and Sweatin' to the Oldies III. I love the music and dancing, however it is hard to follow this video because the camera isn't always on Richard at the beginning of a dance or when he changes steps. Head shots don't help with foot work. STTO III is more professional in this regard. At first I thought that this didn't provide as good a workout as STTO III, but my heart rate and sweat prove otherwise. I believe it is because these dances use your arms more. Richard is great for those of us who don't have perfect bodies and probably never will. Even though I am toned and losing weight, I will never look like Denise Austin or Kathy Ireland.

average Comfort, Excellent Sound. Total over the ear and headband associated with excellent sound. The over the ear wasn't so thick as to adequately exclude the world around you so you can even respond to others--after you take them off, of course, and ask them to repeat themselves. ;) poorly being aware of your surroundings can be lethal. Not being aware of your spouse, suicidal. ;) the only comfort I have wish for is a volume or mute control on the cord, but this was an excellent buy for the cost.

Nice looking, BUT very fragile. I kept several of these frames and I had a lot of prints to frame and that d the clean lines, and low cost.I really like the appearance of floating glass frames, and it provides more options for your photos or art.The problem with these frames is that on other things made in China, they are cheap...at great cost.no glass broke from the pressure of putting those little tabs that hold it together down, and (as someone who works with glass) I know that this type of break only occurs in glass which is not properly annealed.What does this mean to you? It is DANGEROUS!!! A product like this should be made with either safety glass, hard glass (pyrex, borosilicate) or, at the very least, properly annealed soft glass (actually any & all of these glasses should be annealed to remove stress)...but, without getting too technical- all I can say is that the glass in this product is unsuitable for it's purpose, and fundamentally unsafe.$LABEL$0,1,1

paige is hilarious. I really loved this show through the first 3 seasons. however, the new Paige character is just hilarious. Not only is she obnoxious in that "I'm a teenager and I know everything" sort of way, she's even self-rightous and soooooo politically correct it's enough to turn your stomach.And she doesn't fit. There's absolutely no chemistry between her and the other girls. None ever developed no matter how many seasons she was on the show.As if that's not bad enough, the scripts just got so incredibly dumb in season 4. I remember watching the first few episodes when it aired and all of us were groaning and rolling our eyes at the goody-goody two shoes approach the writers decided to take. It was like a film strip aimed at teaching third graders how to be good, in that really overbearing, obnoxious sort of way.Skip this one, stick with the first three seasons instead.$LABEL$0,1,1

No thermostat!. The specification of this product clearly states, "Adjustable thermostat automatically maintains desired room temperature". However, there is no temperature thermostat. There is nothing but one knob for high or low power (1 or 2 setting), and a second knob labeled 1-2-3-4-5-6, 6 being highest. No idea what actual room temperature these settings translate too.

only an expert, but I hate it. I've never played an electric guitar, but I some classical guitar lessons a long time ago. I went to my guitar store and looked at the Les Paul Standard, which was more money than I wanted to spend. I read that the Studio was not as pretty, but musically almost the same. Without having seen the instrument, I ordered one.I opened the box and was actually surprised. It really looks nice, a little darker than in the picture. On the heavy side, but feels very well made. I wanted an instrument I won't need to replace in six months, and I'm confident it will stay better than me for the foreseeable future.It makes a good sound as far as I can tell, but as I said, I'm new to the instrument.

A Tip on securing the Router Template Guide Adapter. A previous reviewer (i.e., Adrian) wrote that he had to tinker with it to attach it to his router. I tinkered, and tinkered with the adapter and couldn't get it attached. I even tried to call Bosch but it was after hours. Then I thought I would remove the base plate (it couldn't hurt, right?), and T.G. I did. Because there in lies the secret to attaching it--at least for me. Under the plate I discovered the spring tension latch which must be engaged for the template adapter to lock securely in place. I suspect this is what Adrian meant by his "fiddling", but did not elaborate for those who would follow him. But I have! So now, there should be no excuses. For you other people that are, like I was, ignorant of this latch, now you'll know,and be spared the frustration.Gosh, Adrian, it would have taken you just a minute to elaborate on this. :-)$LABEL$1,1,0
very worth the money. If you really know and like Arkansas this will be very amazing. Arkansas is a beautiful state but you wouldn't know it from seeing this video. They avoid most of the areas of natural beauty and when they do venture slightly into those areas, we notice they filmed this in late winter or early spring when trees are just starting to leaf out, arguably the least attractive time of year in Arkansas.A few of the topics they cover are interesting but most are just stereotypical small town/hillbilly type stuff that could have been shot in rural Kentucky or Tennesee. If you don't know anything about Arkansas before you watch this, you still won't know anything after you see it.Production values are amateurish but would have been OK if they had let the state's natural beauty and friendly people speak for themseves.And it is way overpriced.$LABEL$0,1,1

If you like Spanish Flamenco and 'classical-on-guitar', and have already heard Segovia or Sabicas or Lagoya/Presti or the Romeros or Williams play some of this music, then you might also think Barrueco comes in somewhere distant. For enjoyment, also consider artists Parkening, Bream, Isben, Holzman or... well, all these folks project more than just the notes. This whole effort by Barrueco is an acoustically clear recording but contains not ALL of the music... IMHO.$LABEL$0,1,1
its good....strange but ok. I am 8 months pregnant and was able to have the rocking chair together by myself. I think its ugly and cheap looking. I sat in it for 2 time and when i took my feet off the ottoman there was marks from where my feels had been resting. The cushions is thin and not comfy at all and the fabric is not soft. I wish i had got a better chair :( I do like the inside of the chair, not to big not to small, fits nice in babies room. I would not recommend this chair to anyone...$LABEL$0,1,1

i hate to diss a master p product or a flick with such a dope title but.... what can i say about this movie? truth be told, i gotta finish watching it. i don't want to be too harsh because he is master p and has done a lot for the music industry, but i really don't feel very many of his movies are very bad. i saw this flick about 6 months ago and all i remember is that i turned it off after about 20 minutes. thankfully i rented it and didnt buy it. i would suggest saving your money unless you collect underground indie movies or at least are a HUGE master p and tony cox fan, even still i can't recommend that you buy it.$LABEL$0,1,1
sufficient isolation for office settings, decent sound quality. Compared to stock iPod phones, these are an improvement, but absolutely nothing compared to "real" headphones: Ety er4p, Senn 280, Senn 580, Grado 80 (I own them all).The sound quality is quite mediocre, but I listen to it at such low volumes it hardly matters.At work I don't like sitting with full size phones and the etys, while superb, isolate me too much so these are a nice default.I use it in the office when I need a little bit of isolation from the background noise but not too much isolation so I cannot respond when someone asks me a question.... and they are shiny too..$LABEL$0,1,1
DO not waste your money. it goes. dont waste your money on this P.O.S. I usually never write a review on products, but this product is so wonderful, I would feel wrong if I did not say anything. If your not going to listen, let it be, your going to find yourself wishing you spent your money on something else.$LABEL$0,1,1
Discusthing. I also ought to use the trimmer. The motor doesn't work even after buying new batteries, and the cutting head looks that it's been lost.It's not worth the postage or trouble to return it,so it just fits in the drawer.$LABEL$0,1,1
This is incredible. These songs are NOT performed by the original artists, know that first of all. As such, they sound cheap rip offs (because they are). If this is the kind of music you're after, you are MUCH better off to by it by the artist's themselves or off of other compilations.$LABEL$0,1,1
fun DS games, but..... I love it I sometimes do. The most fun of Mario games but not the worst in my opinion. There are some problems like the saving problem. I can't save much data because some sort of the game only allows you to saved data like the mushroom houses. Overall it's not that good once you geat use to it.$LABEL$1,1,0
Was a great blog, fine book. Salam Pax started out well. Then he got commercialized. The tone of his writing has changed dramatically, and the influence from the anti-war crowd has all but consumed his writing.I'd love to tune back in years from now after he's been forgotten, to see if he returned to writing from the heart.$LABEL$0,1,1
