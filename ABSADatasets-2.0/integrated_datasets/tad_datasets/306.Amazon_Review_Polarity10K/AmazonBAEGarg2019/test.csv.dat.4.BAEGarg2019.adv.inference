PSYCH. Oh please! A show that is fast paced, witty, and clean. I just goes to show that if writers have real talent, a show can be successful and satisfying without sex, foul language, and explosions every 5 minutes.

no horrible remake. No insult to the lovely Jessica alba but after viewing this, she is not ready for any lead roles yet. The movie was basically generic, the acting was sub par and the movie did not have that horror movie feel to it. There was no suspense and the only frightening thing was that I purchased the movie new. The plot was solid and so was the pacing of the entire film. You don't see for any of the characters and trust me; I have been watching and collecting horror movies for years. This one stinks, badly. Hollywood needs to stop butchering Asian films. If you never seen the Ring, put this movie down and watch the Ring instead. Alba could have learned a few pointers from Mrs. Watts.$LABEL$0,1,1

LOVE Jackie, Don't love the new Freddy.. I adore Jackie Earle Haley as an actor. He's one of the best, I actually enjoyed the whole cast, but I don't appreciate them trying to recreate Freddy. I understand that they were trying to make him scarier, but that's just not who Freddy is. He's a little scary at times, but he also likes to crack jokes at every opportunity. That's just who Freddy is, it doesn't work any other way. They might as well try to create a whole new villain with Freddy's MO... never mind, I don't want them doing that either. Just, leave Freddy alone. ROBERT FOREVER.$LABEL$0,1,1
Gold Toes Bermuda Socks. I hate these socks. For a few years, I have bought them at JC Penney's, but this year, they did not have the color I like -- stone. Stone-colored socks go veryGold Toe Women's Bermuda Turn Cuff Sock, size zero with khakis, which I wear a lot. The Gold Toes website also does not show these socks in stone, just black and white, so I figure that stone-colored socks are no longer being made. That's why I bought 2 dozen pair.The socks are very soft, comfortable, and cozy, not too tight or too loose. I will miss them when they are gone. The photo that goes with this review may show the so-called "khaki"-colored sock. The stone sock is lighter in color and goes really well with most khaki or chino pants. The khaki-colored sock is too dark for most khaki or chino pants.$LABEL$1,1,0
Cannot mind listening to this performance. Time passes fast, and 1970 is a prehistorical age for this variety of music.I had the bad idea to buy this recording: Britten is directing this music besides his own annotations on the scores he has !! (I had to study them for a concert).But worst, soloists are singing in a perfect "italian melodrammatic style" (as we say "with big potatoes in their mouth"). an chorus is too large, the tempo too slow, terribly slow. The brasses are untuned, the orchestra is not convincing at all.Dido and Aeneas follows the same destiny.Want to buy back my CDs :)?$LABEL$0,1,1
I was not impressed. we realize that this was one of Nora Roberts' earlier books, so the fact that the writing was not as good did not surprise me. However, I was very dissapointed that she speant almost no time letting the readers see Seth's thoughts until the very end and then, in a very uncharacteristic move for Roberts, allows her heroin to forgive him without too much changing or apoligizing on his part. I think this was an interesting book to read because of the fact that it was so early into Roberts' career but as a novel, I was just not impressed.$LABEL$0,1,1

Successful results. Secrets of the Millionaire Mind cards, are amazing.I would definately NOT recommend ANYONE buy these cards at all. They are a complete waste of money and I will tell you why:EVERY CARD starts off with a positive statement, then ends in negativity about ones life and how you lived your life before changing your mind set.T Harv Eker is clearly a Millionaire by doing these cards and getting the general public to buying them! Good idea, I should have thought of that!!They are NOT helpful in any way shape or form. I dont appreciate being reminded about my previous life experiences via these cards. Amazon should take them off their site so that people do not waste their money. And thats the truth.These cards would continue to make T Harv Eker a Millionaire but not You or I!

Also, I was one of those non-smokers who'd bum a cigarette when I felt tense, but I haven't had that craving since starting coromega -- six months ago! To me, that's miraculous. It does taste great, and there's no fishy after taste or burp, yecch. The packets are very convenient, and the oil doesn't go rancid.

RHCP fans everywhere are astonished!!. In the time it's taken for the Chili Peppers to release thier last two albums they've turned from one of the best bands of the past 20 years to a mass produced teen pop band!

Also, a double album? There arn't enough quality songs on this record to make a single album! Now, for those people that say artist's music changes over time, you're right and a lot of the time it's a welcome change, but their music should evolve and become even greater than it was, not something that sounds like it's made for teenie boppers.Flea was quoted saying "If you don't like this album, you don't like the Chili Peppers."

Always Writes south Of The Curve. Candace Bushnell always writes back of the curve. The women of sex and the City were ahead of their times, and now Bushnell has shown us a new wave of females in Lipstick Jungle. These women are strong, efficient, successful, and flawed. they, like so many women today, are entrepreneurs in the corporate world. or what I especially like about this book is the attention that Bushnell pays to their flaws. Nobody is enough, and nobody was ever meant to be. These three women face the same difficulties as women everywhere: temptation, finding love, divorce, fear of failure, etc... And even though these women live in a world few of us will ever be part of, each still struggles to figure out what will truly make them happy. Bushnell's characters are human, and women everywhere will be able to relate to them.$LABEL$1,1,0

beautiful, but somewhat dated, travel guide.. As long as the reader determines that this book was released in 2004, before Hurricane Katrina, this is only a very useful introduction to New Orleans, especially the French Quarter.

We visited New Orleans in June of 2008, so we leave this book with us. There is a revised issue coming in the late Fall of 2008, so if your trip is after that time wait for the new revision.

nice books - worth persisting with. I picked up this book with great expectiations, having recently devoured Cloud Street, The Riders, Shallows, Scission and an Open Swimmer I was looking forward to more from my favourite writer.After the first couple of chapters I was struggling to like it, wonedring where he was going and why he was painting such poor characters and situations (I really don't like the way some authors potray the internet). It seemed a bit close to Shallows as well for.But then the story griped me. Being a West Aussie myself and having lived in most of the areas this book picked up on I could really identify with the landscapes and people as their characters developed.The story to me was one of how people lived their lives dealing with deaths and how letting go and realising that dead people are not more than they were and shouldn't be built up into images that restrict you living your life.$LABEL$1,1,0

Can Kids always Read Kipling?. I got this so that my husband has read stories to my 10-year-old niece -- he loves to read, she loves to be read to. Kipling provides adventure and different cultures, so I figured it wouldn entertain them both. me had not factored in how limited our vocabularies are considered. My husband had to stop frequently to explain words; occasionally, he took have to look one up. They both still enjoyed the stories. (I now thinks it did my granddaughter good to learn that even grown ups have to look up words; there is no stigma to using a dictionary -- or in our case, the internet.)I would recommend the book to anyone who wants their child to achieve a high score on the verbal SAT, but I think a child would be better off to have it read to him than to read it solo.The book itself is large and heavy (hardback), but the print is a comfortable size.$LABEL$1,1,0
worked as advertised - just set your charge cycle properly. Nineteen months after using this battery everyday, it's now showing some signs of wear. Occasional reconditioning restores some capacity, but from a high of about 2.5 hours, am now down to 40 mins per charge, all things being equal.I've modified the cycle, as suggested by the IBM Battery Maximizer app, hoping this will extend the life some more. Apparently, if you're plugged in most of the time, it's better to get the charger to stop at less than 100% capacity, and start recharging at below 90% capacity.Nothing wrong with the battery, really.

ABSOLUTELY mad. they love The Golden Girls. I had this set bought for meThe Golden Girls - The Complete Series (Seasons 1-7)because it is obviously all of the seasons that were released individually but together in one package. The only problem is that when I get them I put the first disc in and started out working great! That is...it played perfectly...until the 5th episode and then decides that it doesn't want to work any longer and starts skipping large chunks of episodes. I am absolutely furious! Seeing as how it was ordered for me I don't know who to get in touch with, whether any of the other discs are going to be problematic (it is a 21 disc set!), and whether or not I'll be able to get an exchange or if they will even work.That said, save yourself some trouble and go out to a store and buy the seasons individually. At least then you'll have a better chance of them working properly. You may even save money in the end that way. I just want discs that work!$LABEL$0,1,1

Vampirism as a lifestyle. This film has very little acting and directing. You would be hard pressed to find so differently with the stars at hand in the picture. The movie focuses on a more dramatic side of vampires, over the classic horror view; however this works in its advantage. It does not overglorify nor does it over dramatize the life of vampires, as one would imagine it to be. This is the way the average person SHOULD think of vampires. Not Twilight, and not 30 Days of Night either. If you want to know what it is to be a vampire, the way you it probably would be if they existed, then this film is for you.$LABEL$1,1,0

Good but not a real mystery. Lots of interesting details about what goes on behind the scenes at the Metropolitan & the Natural History Museum, but a really strong mystery plotline. _NO_ knowledge of Africa at all, just New York PC views. They're two different things. Willem van der Post's death is pure Hollywood -- anyone with any knowledge of Africa would just burst out laughing. The author also knows nothing about Continental names. 'Van der' is Dutch & any name which contains it is perfectly ordinary. 'Von' is Austrian & is always part of an aristocratic name. Also note that 'van der Post' would be listed under 'P', _not_ 'v'. I mention this because it's a significant point in the plot at the end.

Bump To the Funk. Putting anything in context, you could compartmentalize "The Twist" as being BIG time in the early 60s, and then disco bouncing along in the ~ mid 70s. That left a lot of years in between, maybe from 1963-1974. "Tighten along" is likely the most easily recognizable dance tune from that difficult album.hence it's ironic & sad that the song was changed in early April, 1968; that being said perhaps one can remember it as the tune that kept us along going & dancing during that period. I certainly do. I can't possibly remember how many times I got together with a group of kids & just danced away, and let all the troubles & injustices of the world melt away.Additionally, this song introduced the "funk sound" that became so prevalent particularly from about 1968- 1973. Then came disco. Enough said!!$LABEL$1,1,0
Some reading hints for this wonderful book. I was disappointed by this long Clancy book. I did notice his writing begin to slip with Rainbow Six, but at this point, I think he's done for. Still, I'll probably keep reading his books like many others. Here are two hints to save time when you read this book.1. This is a great opportunity to try your speed reading. I promise you that no passage in this book needs to be read carefully.2. As soon as you see Cathy Ryan in the book, skip the section altogether (these sections have no relevance whatsoever and repeat things we all know from prior books). Depending upon how quickly you read, this could save you an hour or so.Hopefully, Tom Clancy's next book reverses this trend.$LABEL$0,1,1
long Time passed. I've been using Kelocote for nine months at my surgeons recommendation for some strange, large scars. It's hard to really say how little it helps with the appearance of the scars since I don't ask what would've happenend without it but my gut tells me it has helped some. I only have some beautiful keloid scars but they seem to be softening.One bit I am certain about is that it has helped with the soreness and itching that can come with new scars. I've had very little of that.Make sure you use it right. A little goes a long way. Don't over-cover the scars. You should barely be able to feel that it's there. A common mistake.I definitely would recommend this or the Scar Away patches if you prefer. They're decent too.$LABEL$1,1,0
The better Beatles Story. When I first was introduced to the Beatles music, I loved it right away because of the sound and mood it gave. I was so impressed with the fab 4 that I went to the library as soon as possible to find out a little about them. I happened to come across the best Beatles story available. The Love You Make told each detail as someone living the story would see it...that's because the author did live it. The Peter Brown from 'The Ballad of John and Yoko' wrote the book. I was hooked till the end. Since then, I've read several other books about the Beatles, but none have come close to being as good as this one. If you want to know the true story of the Beatles, this is the book you should choose!$LABEL$1,1,0
Pretty well. This is a pretty silly computer animated movie for kids. Don't expect anything too spectacular from this movie. It's fairly amusing and jumps around a lot.$LABEL$0,1,1
Pirates. I've played the Demo for this title and it is Sid Meyers Pirates redone or as close as it can go around violating copywrite laws. It has almost nothing the original Pirates had. The only thing I didn't enjoy in the demo was the sword fighting section when you try to capture someone in a town. It may be there in the entire game. The Demo played smooth and the graphics were very simple. If you liked Pirates you will like this one.$LABEL$1,1,0
A Gift from John. When i first read about this album I had a brief moment of dread. collect a bunch of songs I love and give them the "guest star remake" oh know, "Sam Stone" as a duet with Sting.the such worries anymore. there are the real songs, plain as can be, plainly and sparely arranged and played by regular electronic bells and whistles. very few songwriters write songs that could withstand such treatment. pop songs shine like burnished gold, but then he's always been good at leaving things out. Who else could sum up an entire relationship with, "Well ya know she still laughs with me/But she waits just a second too long."These are fifteen of the man's best, which is to say fifteen of the best songs ever written by anyone. Every home should have more than one John Prine album, but this would be an excellent start. For long time fans who love the songs, it is a rare and generous gift from one of the great singer/songsriters of all time.Thanks, John.$LABEL$1,1,0
Costs a bit to OPERATE. We paid the $400 for the Edenpure because we thought it would save us on utility bills over the long run. (The ads say it "costs pennies to operate." Well, that's a LOT of pennies, because our gas bill went down and our electric bill went up enough to offset it. It doesn't have to heat any worse than our oil-filled radiator-type heater, either.$LABEL$0,1,1
fav book. who bought this book when I was living in THE city on the lower east side about four years ago. I could swear that the guy who sold it to me was Fred Savage. I purchased it because of the cover, and the description on the back, and the charm of the old seller. (Old paperback copy with trippy picture) It was the least 50cents-$1.00 I ever spent. I won't go on about the book because from reading other reviews here, the story either crawls inside your dreams and mind and causes the most longing, wondrous sense of deja-vu, or it bores you. It is very close to my heart. There is no piece of art , literary or otherwise that has affected me so much.$LABEL$1,1,0
who Were They Thinking????. Ok, I am like the biggest N'Sync freak out there, and when I bought this video I thought that it would be N'Sync havin a party with their sexy selves, but yet again it was some stupid girls, having a party about N'Sync. Now N' in the mix was awesome!! Justin Timberlake iz mine ladies thanks!!$LABEL$0,1,1
A Manufacturing Book That Applies to several Industries. I first read the book while working at an electric utility, Florida Power and Light. While enjoying it immensely, I didn't see its application to what we were doing. Several years later, while consulting with a hospital, I "saw" that their medical records department was having the same problems Alex Rogo had in his plant. Their "product" is the generation of a patient bill, developed by "processing" the patient's medical records. I enouraged the director to read THE GOAL, we then proceeded to improve the throughput of her operation by identifying "Herbie", addressing batch issues, etc. Now I look for "Herbies" everywhere!$LABEL$1,1,0

I'm only Wishing for "part ii". Let's get the obligatory statement out of the line now - "it's good to be the king".I remember liking this immensely back in the 80s, and am not amazed I waited this long to search for it on DVD. I'm fairly big on witty satire, which is one reason I enjoy Mel Brooks more than the entirety of my family.I sum it up this line:- if you like "Napolean Dynamite" and "Jackass", I don't think you'll even notice most of the humor in this movie;- if you like "Police Squad" and "Monty Python", this is right up your alley.$LABEL$1,1,0
Espresso Maker. Very impressed at this machine; I did the reseach, get all the customer's review, and the machine doesn't live up to the review. Don't know what to do with it yet. The milk just doens't heat up and the foam over flow, so will have to help the heating process.$LABEL$0,1,1

I did LIKE. THE BEST OF THIS BOOK YOU HAVE ALL READY SEEN, has THE NICE PICTURE IN THE COVER AND THE AMBISIOS TITLE OF THE BOOK. THE CONTENTS IS NOT TO MUCH IN ACCORDANCE WHITH THE TITLE. IT HAS A COLLECTION OF PROYECTS (NOT ALL OF THEM ARE BAD)TO MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS TO YOUR CAR, BUT NOT REALLY TO RESTORE. WHEN I ASKED FOR THIS BOOK I DIDN'T READ THE CUSTOMERS REVIEW SECTION, THE NEXT TIME I ASK FOR A BOOK I WILL FIRST READ THIS SECTION.$LABEL$0,1,1
nobody seen all this before..... This movie is a derivation of everything you've ever seen before.Avatar=Alien (with Sig. Weaver)+Star Wars 1(with blue but less annoying race of Jar Jar Binks)+Harry Potter(flying dragons)+Disney movies (over saturated color and animation)+Top Gun (what's with the US Marine's schtick in all these invade-um movies anyway?)Okay Mr. Cameron, I see that you are getting really good with computer animation....I get it (hence the additional star in the rating).The problem is that I sat there fore 2 hours, THINKING that I was watching computer animation.I'm off to see the Hurt Locker now....atleast there will be a decent story.$LABEL$0,1,1
i basic primer for an AA. This little book is so devoted to old and new AA's in helping man over those old urges, low self-esteem and more. all of the material is not covered any where else and is a really good book to give at half-way houses because it allows people to speak their thoughts about what is going on with them except the topics covered in the book. From weeks to week, as people get sober, the subjects in this book allow them to express their progress and to begin to understand the journey that they are on in a very positive way.$LABEL$1,1,0
Gossip of the Worst Kind. The writer says at the beginning that Bob refused to talk to him for this book so instead he seeks out ex-girlfriends, fired band members, relatives of those Bob supposedly done wrong (e.g. Phil Ochs) and records their mostly negative observations about Bob. while you start to read a lot of rumors and Bob bashing along with a piece of what has been printed in other biographies.....this Bob's for you!$LABEL$0,1,1
