Missing pin?. Maybe I'm just stupid and should have realized this from the acronyms in the product description, but there is a pin that is not wired in this cable. This pin happens to be the signal that tells my laptop hardware info on the monitor I attach to... so when I hook this cable to my Samsung DLP HDTV that has a VGA port, my laptop can only assume its a generic VGA monitor and displays in resolutions that don't fit on my HDTV (like 1024x768.) I tried another VGA cable I had that has all the pins wired, and my laptop immediately recognizes the display as a Samsung HDTV and defaults to a 720p resolution. Since the purpose of purchasing this cable was to hook up to my HDTV, this cable is useless to me.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Sound great but flimsy. Will not last.. I tried the cheaper in ear noise cancelling Sony earphones and they broke in a very short amount of time. I figured the more expensive version would be more durable. I WAS WRONG. These broke in an even shorter amount of time - 2 weeks. $50 is a lot to spend on disposable headphones. I guess Sony makes all of their products disposable; portable CD-players, stereos, etc. Sony customer service also sucks. Pray you'll never have to deal with them. Better yet, just don't buy Sony and go with Shure. It is more but worth it because it will last. Buy from a company that doesn't believe in disposable products.$LABEL$0,0,-100

This is how music is supposed to be.... McLachlan is astounding! Her voice combined with the cleverly written lyrics are emotionally charged; something that is rare with many female artists, specifically mainstream.I first heard Sarah when her song, "I Will Remember You", was played in a video montage of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Captivated by her beautiful voice, I wanted to hear more. Thinking that "I Will Remember You" was a track on Surfacing, I purchased the album. You'd think I'd be disappointed to find out it wasn't, but I was highly satisfied with the mistake I made! I immediately fell in love with almost song (with the exception of "I Love You").The lyrics are dark, deep, & oddly unique, McLachlan's voice it haunting, both making Surfacing so damn good.This album is highly recommended.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Only for serious Akkerman fans. I bought this as a CD in 2012, forgetting that I had owned it as a vinyl LP in the late 70s. If I had remembered, I would not have bought it again. I DO like the final 7 short songs of the album: some blues-rock that sounds improvised; also a jig and a couple medieval pieces that are cool but not as well developed as some similar works that appeared on Focus 3, Hamburger Concerto, and Akkerman's album Tabernakel. HOWEVER, the first cut, "Fresh Air", is a tedious, 20 minute example of one of those 1970s unsuccessful attempts to elevate rock music to a higher art form. Yes, there are some impressively-fast guitar licks which are instantly recognizable as Jan Akkerman. But, otherwise, I find the song unlistenable; beginning and end are dreary, noisy chaos in between. Quite a bipolar album!$LABEL$0,0,-100
a vital and reliable companion to u.s. history today. This volume contains entries that deal with concepts, events, persons, and movements in u.s. history. The length of the entries is appropriate to the topic considered. In addition, the entires both inform the reader with up-to-date information and indicate how revisionist historians have resahped opionions or refocused the discipline. The entries are clearly written and eminently readable. They are persuasive in thier opionions, yet respectful of other stances. The cross references are helpful and ample. The same obtains for the bibliographies. The Oxford Companion to U.S. History far surpasses some other contemporary dictionaries in U.S. history. Its articles are treated in more depth and greater nuances. The entries in the other dictionaries are too short and far too superficial. I would highly recommend this for people involved in serious historical study and research.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Don't start reading this series.... Although this is mostly a well-written series, do not read it until the author has the full set of books completed, which at the rate he is working will be in about 10 years. He is already about 4 years behind on the next installment (A Dance with Dragons), and two more novels are supposed to be added after that. Just on content, this book is worth 4 stars, but the lack of completion for the series ruins it.Also, be sure to note that the content is for adults only, with some sexually explicit material.It also seems that the latter books in the series tend to ramble, making me long for the more concise, action-oriented content of the first two books.$LABEL$0,0,-100

(You in the craft know what I'm referring to...those who enter the craft for all the wrong reasons, who want to impress people, and do no real work to gain knowledge) I'm sorry, I hate being negative, but if you are seeking lots of pretty pictures complete with a snazzy little "bow" to tie the book closed-this fills the bill.

Wake Up Simmons, Your product needs WORK.. In my 59 years as a farm boy and then an engineer, I've seen some poorly designed products...and this one needs some work. Our water quality is quite good but my hydrants eventually begin to weep after it is shut down. I was sold these with the assurance by the sales person that the working/moving parts could be serviced above-ground. NOT-SO. The stem was so well stuck that I was sure that I was going to break it if I pulled any harder. So I reassembled the unit and worked the handle and adjusted the tension until it finally quit leaking. That is the last time I've used either of the units. Now these exist as legacy waste on my farm and a lesson learned. Don't buy these unless you want to dig them out of the ground after 3-4 years.

Listen before you buy. I would have not bought this album if I had a chance to (legally) listen to the whole thing first.This album may be good in its own right, perhaps by another band or even as a side project, but I enjoy Slipknot for their style of brutality and this was such a major disappointment. A little change or experimentation is good although this is just too much.

Still Tight After All These Years. Another disc of solid musicianship from the current lineup of Chicago. Gone is the syrupy, smoky haze of stellar production by David Foster, Humberto Gatica, Chas Sanford and Ron Nevison. I'm not saying that like it's a bad thing, as I loved Chicago with heavy production but Chicago "Stripped" still shows what a great bunch of musicians these guys still are and always have been. Little to no processing on instruments or vocals [there are a few verbs, delays and keyboard/sequencers/loops, but if you can find them, they're ALL the way in the back] this is a solid bunch of songs accomplished only as Chicago can do them. Four out of five stars because I wasn't dazzled through the first listen, but I did have a smile on my face the whole time. Standout cuts: '90 Degrees and Freezing', 'Lovin Chains' & 'Feel'.

Not one-touch. I bought a Maxtor product assuming that it would function like the100GB and 200GB products that I had purchased previously -- walk upto a PC, turn on the Maxtor, connect the USB cables, and it's done.Unfortunately, since this terabyte drive came pre-formatted for a Mac,I had to install their software, re-format the Maxtor, and thenit became a "one-touch" product.Maxtor should sell products that are consistent with their originalphilosophy, i.e. sell a "one-touch" drive in two editions -- onepre-formatted for the PC, one for the Mac, and whatever otherpre-formatted flavors.It's nice to tinker with computers and hard drives, but as an end-userI expect the product to be useful out-of-the-box.

This and other testosterone-laden information unfortunately comes well into the book, so I plowed through to the end. I couldn't suspend disbelief in order to believe that any human can discern the difference between 1.4 seconds and 2.1 seconds (as it relates to the time it takes for a bullet to travel). I believe it took me 3.7 seconds to scan through each page to a part that I could tolerate reading until the end of the book, which fell flat.$LABEL$0,0,-100
I love the book and the series. It was a great book and series. Keep in mind it is an historical fiction - so some is simply made up. I read all of the series, and even though you know the ending it was a wonderful adventure.One funny - and a little distracting for me, was the fact that corn was mentioned in the book... I wrote the author, explaining that corn was a "new world" discovery, and did not exixt in Eurpoe durin the Roman days. He did change the next book, but did not get all corn out... He sent me an autographed first edition for my "help"...$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not Good. Sure Christina has a good voice,but a good cd? No way!I was excited to get this cd after hearing Gini in a Bottle and What a Girl Wants but once I listened to it I instantly took it out of my cd player. Hardly any songs are good or catchy.

What???. I saw a special on Mario Bava and it featured many of his horror films. They looked very interesting and interviwers said tha many of Bava's ideas were later copied by American filmakers. With that said "Lisa and the Devil" filmed in '76 is a mess of a movie. It makes no sense, and sometimes that's fun in a horror flick, but in this movie it's annoying and quite dull. I realize I saw this movie on cable but what happened to the exorcism scene that I saw in the special on Bava. Not that it would have made the movie any more intelligable, but at least a bit more interesting. Overall not a good movie.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Hitech - AC Adaptor Plug (converts European plugs to US Outlets). We bought a small fan in Spain last summer to provide some ventilation in a small room some friends in Madrid were letting us use as we traveled around from one place to another. It was so efficient that we decided to make room for it in an extra suitcase we had to buy to get the things we acquired in Spain home. This adaptor plug works just fine in doing what it was designed to do. However, be aware of the fact that your appliance without further adaptors to change the current from 110 to 220 will function at about half the speed! Of course, you could plug your appliance into a 220 outlet if you can figure out how to make that work.¡Buena suerte! (Good luck!)$LABEL$1,0,-100

Richard is the Best. This isn't his best.. I use this and Sweatin' to the Oldies III. I love the music and dancing, however it is hard to follow this video because the camera isn't always on Richard at the beginning of a dance or when he changes steps. Head shots don't help with foot work. STTO III is more professional in this regard. At first I thought that this didn't provide as good a workout as STTO III, but my heart rate and sweat prove otherwise. I believe it is because these dances use your arms more. Richard is great for those of us who don't have perfect bodies and probably never will. Even though I am toned and losing weight, I will never look like Denise Austin or Kathy Ireland.

Keeps a smile on your face. This American release of the British powerhouse recording star contains a sampling of the types of songs which keep your feet tapping and a smile on your face.

Poor Design. The roll is WAY too large for anything other than long pattern Snap-on wrenches or similar. I have no idea what they were thinking when they designed this monstrosity as the designer surely did not experiment with actually putting standard wrenches in it. The pockets are just too deep to be of any use. It is really close to worthless because it just takes up too much space and the wrenches get lost in the overly large pockets. Also, it is not cotton duck and it is made in China. I found other rolls by Tool Pak and they are 100 percent better.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Total Comfort, Excellent Sound. Total over the ear and headband comfort with excellent sound.

Not being aware of your spouse, suicidal. ;) The only thing I could wish for is a volume or mute control on the cord, but this was an excellent buy for the cost.

Nice looking, BUT very fragile. I bought several of these frames and I had a lot of prints to frame and like d the clean lines, and low cost.I really like the look of floating glass frames, and it provides more options for your photos or art.The problem with these frames is that like many things made in China, they are cheap...at great cost.The glass broke from the pressure of putting those little tabs that hold it together down, and (as someone who works with glass) I know that this type of break only occurs in glass which is not properly annealed.What does this mean to you? It is DANGEROUS!!! A product like this should be made with either safety glass, hard glass (pyrex, borosilicate) or, at the very least, properly annealed soft glass (actually any & all of these glasses should be annealed to remove stress)...but, without getting too technical- all I can say is that the glass in this product is unsuitable for it's purpose, and fundamentally unsafe.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Overlooked, Undervalued, But Still A Pop Music Masterpiece. Fine songwriting, produced with perfection, and timelessly listenable.When this recording was released Loggins and Messina would soon break up. You'd never know it.Many excellent recordings suffer from not having enough drama; an all-over sameness of sound, tension without release, bad pacing. I could describe many qualities that make recordings with wonderful parts not wonderful as a whole. In contrast, Mother Lode is the complete package, enjoyable in its full presentation as it is in its individual parts. A real gem.I loved the L.A. country-rock style of the early albums. The fine crafting of songs. This effort, while not as commercially viable as its predecessors, still resonates today in a way that the more popular Loggins and Messina recordings do not. I urge you to give it a place in your CD collection.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Paige is intolerable. I really loved this show through the first 3 seasons. However, the new Paige character is just unwatchable. Not only is she obnoxious in that "I'm a teenager and I know everything" sort of way, she's even self-rightous and soooooo politically correct it's enough to turn your stomach.And she doesn't fit. There's absolutely no chemistry between her and the other girls. None ever developed no matter how many seasons she was on the show.As if that's not bad enough, the scripts just got so incredibly dumb in season 4. I remember watching the first few episodes when it aired and all of us were groaning and rolling our eyes at the goody-goody two shoes approach the writers decided to take. It was like a film strip aimed at teaching third graders how to be good, in that really overbearing, obnoxious sort of way.Skip this one, stick with the first three seasons instead.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I think audiences crave this - learning how other people react to tragic and heartbreaking events in their lives.

Great DVD content but.... I watched this on a cable channel a while ago, and I was so glad to finally see this on DVD (it was only available on VHS), I read the review of the other same title DVD and I decided to get this because this one seemed not to have the 1:30 Devine comercial, to my bad luck the person who shipped my product from amazon apparently didn't have a clue of this and sent me the Devine (cheaper) one and I paid the price for this one :-( I don't even know if I could something about it.Wynton Marsalis is the best by the way.

Of course there have been students who didn't get it or who did get it and simply didn't like the book, but most (possibly over 80%) have enjoyed the story and learned something from it.

Short battery life. Using Rechargeable AAA batteries, with the Battery Saver feature turned on, about two hours. Sometimes I get more using alkalines, but not much more. Honestly, this unit is worthless, because I can't trust the batteries.Order a Garmin Etrex Legend instead. It isn't much more expensive, larger or heavier, and it includes a base map of roads, towns, and shorelines. The Legend comes with a cable to transfer data from your computer.

Aesthetically Pleasing. Great to look at -- in the tradition of Eraserhead or Freaks.But that's the troublesome aspect. It's mostly aesthetics, with a great backup score.Very little information, almost no social consciousness -- one would think it had been made decades ago. Singer objectifies the people in front of the lens shamelessly. Or perhaps he is just woefully behind the times and didn't know what he was doing. I would hope that was the case.

Great companion when watching the series. I love this book. I refer to it and make my own notes in it when I watch each episode so that someday I will have watched them all. One thing that I have a question about. This is regarding the few episodes that were taped rather than filmed. The author says they were taped then transferred to 16mm film for broadcast. I just don't understand why they they wern't just broadcast from the original tape. This way they would not "look like a copy of something" rather than an original tape. You would think that with today's technology restoration could be made of these tapes to make them look other than a cheap Kinescope from the past. Otherwise, thanks for a great book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

best invention ever for cat owners - but costly. I absolutely LOVE my scoop-free self-cleaning litter box. I can't think of a chore I hated more than cleaning out the litter box, and now I can ignore it for two weeks. Change the refill is quick and not too messy. The refills are expensive, but to me, it's worth it to avoid dealing with cat litter on a daily basis. I don't find the smell to be much of a problem, except a little in the summer.One other thing I'll mention is that the company has great customer service. When my first box stopped working, they were very responsive. First they sent some troubleshooting ideas, and when those didn't work, they sent a free replacement which came very quickly.So bottom line: I'd give it 5 stars if the refills were not quite so expensive, but other than that, it's a product I don't think I could live without anymore.$LABEL$1,0,-100
No thermostat!. The description of this product clearly states, "Adjustable thermostat automatically maintains desired room temperature". However, there is no temperature thermostat. There is nothing but one knob for high or low power (1 or 2 setting), and a second knob labeled 1-2-3-4-5-6, 6 being highest. No idea what actual room temperature these settings translate too. I am very disappointed! I ordered this over a Honeywell electric silent baseboard heater because the DeLonghi description said it had a thermostat.It does heat silently and pretty well, but it had a large dent on the top of the unit due to poor packaging and delivery damage.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Entertaining and illuminating, enjoyable, but not Faulkner. Heddle obviously draws from his knowledge of the physics academic community (and physics itself) to write this. This is to the good; one should write about things one knows about, and this allows one to convey the ring of truth (and allows the reader to actually learn something).His point of view is also clear, but not thrust annoyingly upon the reader (at least to my ear). (Unlike other authors who write in science-related fields whom I could point out.)There is good use of humor (I laughed out loud in places as well), insight into human behavior, etc.; so it's definitely worth a read.But in honesty, I wouldn't quite consider it highbrow/fine literature.

Merely a retelling of Anna's book. I was quite disappointed in this book, especially since it claims to be a scholarly work. As a scholar of Thailand, I was very disppointed and didn't get further than Chapter 1. The author clearly has no knowledge of Thailand's history, language, or religion let alone how Anna Leonowens is looked upon by Thais. Chapter 1 is merely a retelling, almost like a cliff notes version, of Anna Leonowens' & Margaret Landon's novels. While it was nice to see the debunked history of Leonowens' life, it would've been nice to see the debunked history of her writings as well.$LABEL$0,0,-100

They've got two of the three Stones of Midnight, so they have that adventage. But Liz is devestated - she's just lost Adam, and the thought that she might lose Max, the love of her life, as well is almost more then she can bear.

But can they triumph - or are the efforts too little too late? Read to find out!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not an expert, but I like it. I've never played an electric guitar, but I some classical guitar lessons a long time ago. I went to my guitar store and looked at the Les Paul Standard, which was more money than I wanted to spend. I read that the Studio was not as pretty, but musically almost the same. Without having seen the instrument, I ordered one.I opened the box and was pleasantly surprised. It really looks nice, a little darker than in the picture. On the heavy side, but feels very well made. I wanted an instrument I won't need to replace in six months, and I'm confident it will stay better than me for the foreseeable future.It makes a good sound as far as I can tell, but as I said, I'm new to the instrument. Still, very pleased.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A Tip on securing the Router Template Guide Adapter. A previous reviewer (i.e., Adrian) wrote that he had to tinker with it to attach it to his router. I tinkered, and tinkered with the adapter and couldn't get it attached. I even tried to call Bosch but it was after hours. Then I thought I would remove the base plate (it couldn't hurt, right?), and T.G. I did. Because there in lies the secret to attaching it--at least for me. Under the plate I discovered the spring tension latch which must be engaged for the template adapter to lock securely in place. I suspect this is what Adrian meant by his "fiddling", but did not elaborate for those who would follow him. But I have! So now, there should be no excuses.

Many times we have been cooking rice in it and steaming vegetables in the tray at the same time, and it has always come out nicely. After about 18 months of use, it just flat out stopped working. It worked one day, and the very next day - nothing. No light on the front, no heat from the heating element, nothing. As it was well out of warranty, I took it apart and could find no parts that looked to have failed. All of the electrical connections were solid with no corrosion. No broken or shorted wires, no burned out components. It just gave up the ghost for not apparent reason. Not worth the money.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Rupesh Goel. Clark has written a book both simple and detailed - for both the specialists and the generalists - in the big, bad, and exciting world of simulations.Sometimes the process IS the product - if you believe that you will love the notes in the book from Clark's developer's diary - he brilliantly captures the tradeoffs of design, technology, learning, legal and commercial issues, in the process of creating the simulations.I recommend this to anyone serious about simulations development or use.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Some real gems here.... After listening to Mr. Armstrong's work on albums such as the Moulin Rouge and Rome + Juliet soundtracks, I was really looking forward to seeing what he did on his own. While some tunes here are WAY too sentimental for me, the majority (especially the instrumental pieces) are wonderful. Soaring, simple melodies that take you from here to there and back again... It's one of the reasons why music is so powerful.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Eh, not as good as I remember. I remember catching an episode of this show here & there was I was young, probably 12. I remember it being kinda fun. So I impulsively bought this dvd (somewhere else for around $20) & I just couldn't get into it. I watched about 3 1/2 episodes, but Jessica (one of the main stars) just grated on my nerves. This girl was such a tease. Plus everytime she did something wrong she got off pretty lightly. If anything she would get back at somebody else. She was also very easily forgiven by her sister, whom she used just like everyone else. Some shows like Saved by the Bell I can watch now & still enjoy, but not this show. I'm happy for the huge fans of this show that it's out there for them. However, if you aren't a hard core fan, like me, make it a rental, not a purchase. Oh, the show also seems like a showcase for these girls bodies. So I wouldn't be surprised if some girls brothers decided to watch this show with them.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Nice Lantern. This lantern is sturdy built. It a thicker plastic outside, than the one I had. I believe the battery is what gives it more weight. It is not real heavy and I can still lift it with no problem. It is just different than the one I had, and takes getting use to it. I have not had to actually use it for a power outage as of yet, but have turned it on to see how it does, and it works good. I like the looks of it, and am glad I chose this one. I believe it to be a good lantern and would recommend it.It qualified for the super saver shipping at Amazon, so shipping was free. I like those type of deals.I believe this lantern is going to last a long time.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not worth the money. If you really know and like Arkansas this will be very disappointing. Arkansas is a beautiful state but you wouldn't know it from seeing this video. They avoid most of the areas of natural beauty and when they do venture slightly into those areas, we notice they filmed this in late winter or early spring when trees are just starting to leaf out, arguably the least attractive time of year in Arkansas.A few of the topics they cover are interesting but most are just stereotypical small town/hillbilly type stuff that could have been shot in rural Kentucky or Tennesee. If you don't know anything about Arkansas before you watch this, you still won't know anything after you see it.Production values are amateurish but would have been OK if they had let the state's natural beauty and friendly people speak for themseves.And it is way overpriced.$LABEL$0,0,-100

"In Pursuit of a better game". I was very disappointed with this game. I thought since it was a Trivial Pursuit game that I would would enjoy it as much as the original.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this game and stick with original Trivial Pursuit games!$LABEL$0,0,-100

disappointed. We dined in the restaurant and enjoyed the food; I found it to be comparable with restaurants in Mexico. I ordered the book and was totally disappointed.

Plays the Notes. If you like Spanish Flamenco and 'classical-on-guitar', and have already heard Segovia or Sabicas or Lagoya/Presti or the Romeros or Williams play some of this music, then you might also think Barrueco comes in somewhere distant. For enjoyment, also consider artists Parkening, Bream, Isben, Holzman or... well, all these folks project more than just the notes. This earnest-but-mechanical effort by Barrueco is an acoustically clear recording but contains not ALL of the music... IMHO.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A wide range of material which shows off her talent.. The first time I heard her music was when "Dive" was new. Since then I forgot about her. A friend was talking about her so I bought "Eden". Wow! it blew me away. Her range of material as well as her amazing voice are incredible. After listening to it all day I plan to collect the other discs she has out, even the imports. For anyone who is tired of hearing the same tired material played on the radio I highly urge you to check out this disc. It's incredible.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Bellydance. Keti Sharif has put together a very informative and delightfully presented instructional book. The photography is excellent and the instructions are very clear and make sense.Keti Sharif is australia born and lives on the Red Sea in Egypt. She performs and teaches bellydance and hosts cultural tours of Egypt. Well done Keti. I teach bellydance and will be only too pleased to promote this book at my classes. My students will most likely buy a copy of this book.Anyone interested in Bellydance and Egyptian Culture or Middle Eastern Culture would be very pleased with the contents of this book, women love to express themselves and this type of dance does so refreshingly and culturally diverse techniques are explained.To celebrate our bodies is our divine right and we can enhance our health by bellydance.

Most annoying chord book, ever. I have a banjo chord book that is arranged by note. If you want to learn a C7 all you do is go to the C section. This one is arranged by key. If you are a beginner like me, I bet you are just trying to learn chords, not keys yet. You have to flip all through the book trying to find your chord. Find a book where the chords are listed in the order of notes, not by keys. You will be much happier.$LABEL$0,0,-100

i hate to diss a master p product or a flick with such a dope title but.... what can i say about this movie? truth be told, i couldnt finish watching it. i don't want to be too harsh because he is master p and has done a lot for the music industry, but i really don't think very many of his movies are very good. i saw this flick about 6 months ago and all i remember is that i turned it off after about 20 minutes. thankfully i rented it and didnt buy it. i would suggest saving your money unless you collect underground indie movies or at least are a HUGE master p and tony cox fan, even still i can't recommend that you buy it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

sufficient isolation for office settings, mediocre sound quality.

shallow and disappointing. I thought this book was dull and disappointing. If you are looking for just a bit of light reading for the sake of a story, this may be the book for you - but if you are looking for a novel that is intriguing, moving and involving, this certainly didn't make the grade for me. The writing is dull, the characters are flat, the plot moves along like a simplistic fantasy with the characters making their choices with an unrealistically shallow level of conflict. I personally found I was unable to empathise with any of them because I felt they just weren't real to me, despite the book's issues being quite close to my heart. It's magazine-rack stuff.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Fascinating story. This story is absolutely captivating. The author is a man who is unable to communicate except for his ability to blink one eye. The entire book was dictated in this manner after having suffered a stroke. I read this book from the mindset of a health professional and I found it to be very helpful for empathizing with the patient. It is important to remember that just because a patient cannot speak, does not mean that they are not fully in their mind. I think this book would be a fascinating and useful read for both health professionals and lay persons.$LABEL$1,0,-100
