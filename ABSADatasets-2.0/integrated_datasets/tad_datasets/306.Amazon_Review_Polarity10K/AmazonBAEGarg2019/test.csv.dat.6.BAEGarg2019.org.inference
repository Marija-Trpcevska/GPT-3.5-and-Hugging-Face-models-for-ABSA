Doesn't clean dishes at all. I had been very pleased with Meyer's products, especially the basil scented all purpose cleaner and cleansing powder. This product is awful. Dishes do not come clean, even if I rinse prior to washing. I called Meyer's to see if they would offer a coupon for another product since I was very disappointed. They increased my disappointment by acknowledging the the product doesn't work at all on tea or coffee stains but didn't offer anything other then "return it to the store you bought it from". terrible customer service$LABEL$0,0,-100

Worst Scoop Ever, Cute Case. Whoever designed this has never scooped a cat litter box and has no clue about how this scoop wouldn't work for doing such a thing. Anyone who likes this scoop must not realize there are other scoops out there that would make the job 1000 times easier.The angle of the scoop is all wrong so you can't really get any leverage. It's no surprise to read reviews about the scoop breaking. It's just not made properly to be a scoop. The scalloped edge in the front is another design flaw that leads to a poorly designed useless scoop.My poor arthritic mom has been struggling with this scoop for months, not knowing she could be in less pain and get the job done quicker and better if only she had a good scoop.I wish I could give this product negative stars for the pain it's given my mother.$LABEL$0,0,-100

An incompetent attempt to compose a makeshift compillation without knowing anything abouth the epoch. 9/10 of the stuff represents commercial pop or more or less decent music but with no relation to the hippy culture.

a couple of good rarities. This compilation has an edited version of "Figure Of Eight", which I believe is the same as the single version. There are two rarities on this CD which are worth the purchase to the serious collector; "Party Party" is a dance number, sounding pretty much from the era it was recorded in (late 1980s). "I Wanna Cry" is a slow, hard driving blues tune. Fairly sure these tracks were recorded during the "Flowers In The Dirt" sessions, since this disc was released around the same time.

Holes Is Kool / By:Munadi Grade 6, Brooklyn!!!. My Review of Holes is that Holes is all about a kid named Stanley Yelnats is accused of stealing shoes but he didn't, but Zero did and then he dropped it off a bridge, and it landed on Stanley. Stanley fell with the shoes and the police thought that he stole the shoes from the homeless shelter. So, the police caught Stanley and put him in the military camp called Camp Green Lake. And all you have to do there is just dig holes to find a mystery object that only the evil warden knows about. This book teaches you a lesson: Don't ever steal anything because you might end up in a place like Stanley was, or maybe even worse...$LABEL$1,0,-100
Poor Audio Mix. I purchased this disk along with others to play in my Acura DVD-A system. I found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing...and the mix to be a bit "over the top" with surround effects. Major vocals coming from rear speakers, etc.I also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk. In fact, the demo disk for my TL has the Marvin Gaye song "Let's Get It On" and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection.If you are looking for DVD-A disks with 5.1 surround...I'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the CD of this album.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Camera has never taken great pictures and 5 months after the warranty ran out, the camera quit. It turns on for a second, shows an E106 error message, and shuts down.

Not up to standards of Denise Austin. I've used Denise Austin items for years and have been happy. I was not happy with this video. Her pace was too quick and she did not give instructions beforehand. There was a woman on the video who was doing the "modified" version but she didn't state that too well into the program. She changes everything quickly without notification and with little instruction in "how to". Very disappointed.

Truly Brilliant!. Gates of Fire is, hands down, one of the best historical fiction books ever written, in my opinion. One of the most incredible things about this book, as has been the case with all of Pressfield's books, is the amount of historical fact that it contains. I've read it 4 times, thus far, and love it every single time! I, also, highly recommend his lastest work "The Profession", incredibly entertaining and offers a work, from which Pressfield had to create the "historical facts", rather than simply researching them. Of which he did an outsanding job!$LABEL$1,0,-100

I'm not insane!!. I remember watching this flick when I was about 10 years old over at a friend's house. This was a sit on the edge of your seat and hold your breath movie. At least at that age it was. However, as the years have gone by (I'm 25 years old now), I have found it nearly immpossible to find this movie. And of course my cohorts must be thoroughly uncultured, because it is even more remote to find someone who has actually seen or heard of this movie. So I'm in a record store a couple of years ago and decide to take a chance and see if they carry it or can order it and lo and behold..... This flick DOES exist!! And NOOOOOOOOO, they can't order and break my heart in telling me this. Now if only I can bide my time long enough to get my hands on a copy. My kids are gonna love it!$LABEL$1,0,-100

tfciii. To make my review meaningful, I am at a disadvantage because I did not own a Kindle 1 before I bought the Kindle 2. Having read many Kindle 2 reviews of customers who owned the earlier model I knew of many of their negative comments.I love my Kindle 2. I find it works great even reading in bright sunlight, but it is not so good reading in limited light. Among the negative comments from those who previously owned a Kindle 1 was that Amazon advertised that no book would cost more than $9.99. Obviously, many books do cost more than that. As to what Amazon previously advertised, I don't know.It is a great way to spend time reading from a list of reading material I choose, especially when I am on the road.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Golding at his Greatest. Golding certainly seems to root out the very psychology that lays behind the rudimentary world of the male youth. In magnificently eloquent prose and a deeply engrossing story to boot, Lord of the Flies has deservedly been dubbed a modern classic.

The Dutiful Rake. Harriet Klausner summarized the plot so I won't do that here, but her 5-star review is way off. I will say this novel had such a nice beginning. A spirited and independent heroine, and a masculine but not overly domineering hero who was attracted to the heroine without really wanting to be. Well, all that burnt out real quick, and the heroine somehow became timid, and easily led into stupid situations, while the hero became thick-headed and unreasonable.I don't like novels where it's obvious that just a simple conversation between the two main characters will clear the air and resolve their differences -- and they never have that conversation until the last five pages of the book. (Sigh.) This is not a horribly bad story, and it's not badly written, but I got more and more annoyed with the plot and with the characters as I read on. I just think Ms. Rolls is capable of much better storytelling than this.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Good size but fit is hit or miss. We have a few of these. In different sizes. They go together easily. No idea why the first step is knocking out plastic parts. They couldn't do this? Otherwise assembly takes about 60 seconds. We have several of this size box and some have tops that fit perfectly. Others have tops that are too deep and the lock hole doesn't line up. It is weather resistant but not water (or insect) proof. Even when perfectly assembled there are small cracks between the pieces that allow small bugs to enter. So not for dog food or anything like that. Stuff inside stays dry. Also, if you use a lock understand that the lock is just aesthetic.

Asleep at the Watch. Immerse yourself once again in the seafaring adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey and his ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin as they roam the almost unexplored oceans of the early 17th century, and participate in the bittersweet "liberation" of Chile. The 85 year-old O'Brian's flawless dialogue and meticulous attention to detail makes this book -- like the rest of the series -- a historical tour de force. Unfortunately after 20 previous books, Aubrey and Maturin have few surprises left, and hundreds of pages filled with the impenetrable politics and minutia of daily naval life may be as stupefying as Dr. Maturin's regular doses of laudanum and hellebore for readers unaware that a great naval battle invariably lurks in the closing pages. O'Brian addicts will welcome another chance to visit their favorite characters, but people new to O'Brian should visit the earlier, fresher books of the series -- say "The Far Side Of The World."-- Auralgo$LABEL$0,0,-100
Disappointing. When purchasing this book, I expected to read about rodeo and native american life with a little romance. I did learn a lot of the native american way of life and enjoyed reading about it. The romance story line was decent, but not incredible. The only mention of rodeo was towards the end. When the author misinformed the readers and wrote that the flankstrap used in the roughstock events is tied around the animals testicles. This is untrue. The fact is that the strap is used as a conditioning tool and does not harm the animal at all. In fact, some of the animals used in saddle bronc and bareback (which are horse events)are female not male. The author needed to get her facts straight or left rodeo out of the book completely.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Haunting. After spending a summer alone, Akilah can't wait for her best friend, Victoria, to return from Nigeria (her country of birth). She's excited to start fifth grade with her fun-loving friend.But Victoria comes back a different person. She is subdued, unsmiling, and imposes a new rule on Akilah: "No laughter here." After their class views a puberty video, Victoria reveals the truth to Akilah: While she was in Nigeria, her mother had her circumcised, to make her a "pure" and "clean" Nigerian woman.Shocked, Akilah struggles to do the right thing. She is horrified by the ritualistic cruelty to which her friend has been exposed, but her own family has always taught her to revere traditional African culture.

Wake up to natural healing. Hellinger teaches her readers how to take matters regarding their health into their own hands, literally. The author has brilliantly deduced and presented the lowest common denominator for your ailments. She writes about two natural methods that could save millions of lives during the flu season: the "Hellinger Hiatal Hernia Applied Self-Help Technique" and the "Hellinger Life Saving Technique of Manually Boosting the Immune System." These techniques, which the author discovered and honors, allow you to circumvent drugs and medication that can destroy and handicap the body's natural healing dynamics. Celebrate: once you've healed naturally, it's forever.

Surprisingly good.. I've read a couple of reviews that already give the gist of the story so I'll just give my opinion. I found Aphrodite's Passion so much better than Aphrodite's Kiss, the prequel. This is one of the few books that the heroine isn't an idiot. Which is a rare find these days. However, the hero, Hale, isn't my favorite type, hence the 4 star rating. I can't write what my problem with him is unless I give away too much so let's just say he's a really good hero but not great:)If you're bored with the same old thing, I recommend buying this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Awesome toy. I got this for my daughter's #1 b-day and she loves it. She plays with it all the time with or without the balls.

Every woman should read this book. I borrowed this book from my friend and immediately decided that I needed my own copy.

Walk out of this movie, it'n not worth anyone's time. This movie fails to describe the main Argument and doesn't follow any stroy. It is filled with modern music and fast camera movements whcih distracts viewers from concentarting on the subject. This movie is not worth the 1 hr and 30 minutes that it demands from the audience.

A Worthy Follow-up. Overall, a very enjoyable album and a worthy sophomore effort from Norah Jones. Most tracks feel comfortable and familiar. That's not criticism, but I get the impression that she knows where her strengths are. The one 'outside the box' track is the rather bizarre duet with Dolly Parton. That one should have been left 'outside the CD' as far as I'm concerned. But for that track, I would have given the album 5 stars.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Bad examples poor coverage. I've read about 30 Oracle books. I wanted to find this book useful, but after 100 pages, I could not stomach it.

Finish bad within 1 month. After less than 1 month of use, the entire exterior of the chiminea is spotted, pitted, and streaked. It does not come off. i sent pictures off to Blue Rooster, who promptly replied that it was called OXIDATION, and could be easily fixed with a good scrub down and a couple of coats of high heat BBQ paint. I really don't feel that I should have to go through this after less than a month. If what is needed to prevent this from happening is a couple of coats of high heat BBQ paint, then why wasn't this applied at the factory? I am waiting to see how this will be resolved.The company has refunded the purchase price in full. I do not know why the finish turned so bad so fast, however am pleased with the way the company handled it. I feel that I should add that, apart from the finish, there was nothing else wrong with the chiminea$LABEL$0,0,-100
Perfect. What can I possibly add to what has gone before me? Not for everyone, this incredible tome (or, rather, TWENTY of them!) is a weighty reminder of the turbulent and varied history of the English language. Actually, it IS for everyone. One soon gets lost in the story; each page providing splendid new wonders, and forgotten comforting vistas. How did I live without it?October 2010: a few weeks ago I noticed an issue with Vol 3 - pages 890 and 892 were blank. After some to-ing and fro-ing with Oxford University Press (OUP), I was sent a reprinted copy of Vol 3, this time with all pages printed! Customer support with OUP was fantastic. OUP did acknowledge there is an issue with Vol 3 in some of the printings, and that they intend replacing all faulty copies. So, check vol. 3!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great topic, should have ended far better than it did. Overall the book wasn't a bad read. The topic of exploring some of the sinister aspects of the Catholic world I found very appealing - especially as I am one ! Unfortunately the book started out promising much but in the end turned out a bit of a fizzer. I was left feeling a great deal more could have been done with the topic - to be honest, the ending was nauseating. However, to the credit of Mr Case (whomever that may be) it certainly makes one want to head off and find out more about the subject.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Avoid this player if you like classical music. If you like to listen to CDs where there is no break in the music between 2 tracks, avoid this player! I like to listen to classical music, and often I will program only a few tracks, e.g., to listen to one symphony on a CD with multiple works. The way it is designed, there is a break when switching tracks, so if you're listening to a movement that spans several tracks, you get a "skip"!If I'm listening to an entire CD, it doesn't happen, but it's horrible if you're listening to part of it.I've talked to the company, and it was hard to even explain the problem to them - I guess no one there listens to classical music (or other albums with continuous music) anymore. Their only suggestion, after weeks of discussion, was to take it to a repair shop. Given what I've read elsewhere, I suspect I've stumbled across a design defect, not something that can be fixed.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Complete fizzle of right ear bud after two weeks of use.. I came across these to replace some cheap earbuds I got from the grocery store. I found these and was pleased with the price and the good reviews. I read some of the bad reviews, and noticed a lot were about this very problem. I thought to myself, "Oh, they probably weren't being handled well". That was definitely not the issue. The fizzle happened while I was on a trip, while the earbuds were in my ear. This was very upsetting. I found I could get the sound back for a while if I bent the cord a certain way, but it would simply go out again. They have great sound and fair noise cancelling while they are working. The problem is they don't last long. These are not worth the fifteen dollars I paid for them.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Attractive, but flimsy. . .. While this is an attractive teapot, I am disappointed by the quality of its construction. First, the glass is EXTREMELY thin; also, the lid does not sit tightly on the body of the teapot.

He is 3 1/2 now and instantly remembered the book and has not put it down since. My 7 year old daughter also enjoys it, too.

sharpen your axe, Simon. Another colossal disappointment. Readers and seekers of factual evidence have a difficult time discovering reliable science, which this book does not represent. A scientist or researcher cannot have an agenda other than developing a fair postulate from sound facts. Good research includes all that is known first, and then confining tests to rigorous and sound analysis. Southerton does not do this, as so many pseudo scientists do. This kind of researching falls in the same category as Erich Von Daniken's "research."It's a real pity that people of any faith will cast their beliefs to the wind without first establishing the validity of an author's premise and examination methodology. They are however, of like minds, who look for an excuse to rationalize the abandonment of beliefs over a seemingly unsolvable conflict of ideas.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Let me see, which world is this?. This not a story of something happening, or of people (or Spirits) doing something, but of characters standing around postulating. (Very British, I guess.) When you hear the terms the ages of Mouldwrap and Witspell you think Harry Potter Universe. But you're wrong. When you get to the part where Plato is listing his definitions, you think this will get better, it's a set up, like Douglas Adams in the Hitchhiker Books, preparing to hit you with strings of belly laughs. Wrong, some people might think Ackroyd is funny or a wit. No, he's not. Plato's world seems to be built of elements scoured from Asimov's Nightfall and Brin's The Practice Effect.

Unsatisfying. I think Schickler wrote this book after one too many martinis, or after reading the New York Post for three weeks straight. It attempts to look at both the underbelly and the inner lives of yuppie New Yorkers. The use of the apartment building as a framing device is interesting, but it ultimately points out the book's weakness: a thin plot, and some rather misogynistic, anti-woman writing. Schickler is really interested in the story of one woman, Evie, and the two roommates who both want her. That the story is ultimately sick and simplistic is dissappointing; but that Schickler makes us wade through some sort of mediocre, almost-unrelated chapters on other apartment dweller is worse.

Seriously?. I'm stunned by all the positive reviews of this book. For me it was unreadable. I found the romance to be a "wham-bam" kind of thing, the hero stilted and uninteresting, and the entire tone of the book felt like something written by somebody with no idea of the mores and history of the Regency period. I know this isn't true because I really enjoyed Putney's "The Rake".This book was just painful. There are actually moments when one of the daughters comments on her parents' behavior by saying something like, "There go the Parents again, misbehaving!" It was more like Gidget than something you'd associate with the 18th century. I guess there must be a huge market for heroines who act like they are from 2013, but are stuck in the 18th century, because that is what this book felt like.I'll read more Putney because I've read several of her books that are quite good. This is not one of them.$LABEL$0,0,-100

After all squeezing an epic reading experience into 2 hours is impossible.

To alter the inherent nature of a main character is a crime against the book, and no longer worthy of it's title.

I hadn't heard the alarm before, so we went to check it out. The radio alarm is loud, so it would definitely wake you in an emergency. The weather channel was alerting us that we were in a tornado warning. I got the kids and we went to the basement. About 3-5 minutes later the tornado sirens started going off outside. The alert system gave us several extra minutes before the outside alarms went off. A tornado did not come through our direct area, but it was nice to know when to head to safety. You can set the alarm to sound for many different watches and warnings and for different county areas. With all the extra storms this year, I thought that this could be handy and it already proved it works great.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Same Name - Different Product. As of November 2005 Amazon is shipping "Version 5" of the WRT54G. Thing is - it's a completely different product than they've been shipping for the past several years. Whereas Versions 1-4 were incremental tweaks to the hardware, Version 5 is a completely new entry, with far less RAM and running a completely different operating system (VxWorks). All previous versions ran Linux and were known for their high quality and reliability, as well as the ability to use upgraded firmwares. See other comments here and on other linksys-enthusiast sites - this new version is a turkey. It may be selling under the same name, but it's no different than if Mercedes started selling a Kia witha a trident hastily slapped on it. I've purchased a dozen of the real WRT54G's for friends and family but this is the end of the line. Some say a WRT54GL is available in Europe for our friends there that want the good one (same as version 4 here). Versions 1-4 got 5 stars; this one gets 1.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Nut seized up on first try - had to cut bolt!. Amazon you should remove this item from your store. It is expensive and flawed. As many other reviewers have experienced, I couldn't remove the nut from the bolt after the first application. I had to cut the bolt with a Sawzall to remove. I got this for Xmas and didn't try it until yesterday so I am beyond my return date. Terrible experience all the way around!$LABEL$0,0,-100
Highly readable and provocative. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to talk with John Irving at a dinner party? Wouldn't it be fun to run into the likes of Timothy Findley at the Second Cup and be able to ask him what inspires his writing and what he thinks about the meaning of it all? Most of us are unlikely to have sucn encounters. However, in the spirit of our age of virtual reality, Douglas Todd has provided us with the next best thing. In Brave Souls, he offers interviews with 28 of North America's most intriguing and artistic souls. Patricia Murphy, Catholic Register$LABEL$1,0,-100
Breaks easily and the WORST customer service. Had to send the base unit back TWICE due to it not charging the handset. Was able to send it back after many, many phone calls and explanations to the rep. Have had this phone for less than one year and already hate it for it's unreliability and lack of functions.WORST customer service I've ever encountered.

Well Researched--and Too Much So. Kaplan is an excellent researcher. His book is also boring as all heck, too. Dickens, in my opinion, is usually quite funny, or poignant, or both. Don't bother, unless you're doing a paper on Dicken's kidney problems or his friends, and who cares?$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not great. Having heard the track "This bitter land" from this album and "Sober" from their next release I expected more from this album.

What a read!!!!!!. This book has a very different premise...time travel to the time of Jesus. The story was very researched and a thrill to read.

Full of lies.... When you do not come from an Arabic country, reading this book might be extremely horrifying because of the events that take place in the story. However, if you are an Arab then you know that the events stated in this book will never occur. Saudi Arabia is a country, it has rules and laws, and there are many mnay laws that protect women in Saudi Arabia regardless of what this book says. Many of the information about the Islamic religion is false as well. If you want to read a book to get a sense of what women's lives are in Saudi Arabia and the Arab world then do yourself a favor and do not read this book! Our lives, thank God, are wonderful. We have our rights, and we are equal to men. There is no law that demeans women in the Arabian world. I am an Arab, I am a woman, I come from an open-minded society (Kuwait), and yet I am strongly against this book because it does not speak the truth.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Excellent Energy. I am a relatively new fan of techno and I must say that I find BT to be consistent and energetic. The thing that attracted me to techno to begin with is the complexity of rythym bound together in one presentation. BT does this beautifully, and the first time I listened to "Godspeed" I had goosebumps. BT drew me into this world, as he was the first artist I was introduced to. I have just purchased two of his other works, R&R and ESCM and will review those later. For anyone who is looking to get into techno, I recommend BT. Warning: Do not listen to over and over again, like the NC gent mentioned. It is true. It's like a great movie, you wish you hadn't seen it already so you can enjoy it for the first time all over again.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Another great Star Wars soundtrack. First of all, I would like to point out that I do not own this exact soundtrack but the older collecters edition. I am writing the review on here because the reviews for the other soundtrack are for the movie, not the score. I highly doubt that there is any difference in the music though.John Williams' final installment to the Star Wars soundtracks is just as good as the previous ones. The epic fleet music to the Emperor music is fantastic. This score is a bit darker than its predecessors but that's a good thing considering the story involved. There is a lot of great music in here that should please just about anyone.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A Little Book on Basset Hounds. A review of: Basset Hounds A Andrews and McMeel gift bookFirst of all, this is a tiny book measuring only about 3 inches by 4 inches, but it's packed with interesting and useful information as well as the predictably adorable photos of basset hounds. It starts with an informative history of bassets then gives a detailed description of the "breed standard", the characteristics judges use at dog shows. Then there's very practical advice about choosing a puppy, caring for and bonding with your puppy and some general information about training and care. There's still a lot to know about raising a dog that isn't covered in such a short book, but a surprising amount of information is included between these tiny covers, and it takes at most half an hour to read it all.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Hilarious. I brought the DvD because I was curious about the whole falling out that The Game had with G-Unit. I was surprised at how the the Boroughs of New York embraced The Game and shunned G-Unit.

The Game actually had jokes which made the DvD entertaining and funny.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Surprisingly disappointing. Perhaps I expected too much, but while this book is amazingly comprehensive, it is also amazingly amateurish.

Improbable characters that work. Who else but Elmore Leonard could come up with a phony priest and an ex-con standup comic as his hero and heroine? I'm guessing the Catholic Church left its marks on him in one way or another because he's had Catholic characters in other books, most notably TOUCH and BANDITS. I went to Catholic school, and the title PAGAN BABIES alone was enough to stir memories and draw me in. (And a tip of the hat to the person who thought to put a mission box on the cover. Perfect!) Leonard unfolds this story of scammers and scumbags with a deft hand, giving us a generous helping of his signature humor and bull's eye dialogue. No one writes like him, and thank God he's so prolific. The man is a national treasure.$LABEL$1,0,-100
The Book of Chapin Opens Up. This was the first album I ever bought. At the age of ten (okay I was a weird kid) I cleaned out my parent's garage in exhange for this album. Harry is king of the story-song and some of his best are here. The world became aware of Harry with "Cats in the Cradle" but that song only scratches the surface of his talent. "What Made America Famous" is an excellent story of common-man heroics in the face of adversity. "30,000 Pounds of Bananas" is a light-hearted story of a fateful produce delivery gone awry. "Halfway to Heaven" explores a bored, married man's inner conflict with his beautiful young secretary and his dissatisfaction at having experienced so little in life. Like my other Chapin favorites, it is a song that expresses real emotions and the drama of everyday life. It is an even, somewhat somber album that doesn't come close to matching the energy and heart of his live performances, but it is an outstanding album and a good Chapin starter.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Good Enough To Keep Me Playing. Don't have to worry about batteries or re-charging batteries anymore. Since it's cheaper than the original ones, the material is expected to be cheap too, especially for the buttons.

Brecht's Alienation. The book is a good guide on tracing the evolution of the notion of alienation in theater. A different route from the naturalistic theater tradition, alienation aims at "extracting" emotions in theater and sticking with the message and aim of a play. Peter Thompson's work indirectly traces the idea of showing that acting is just plain "acting". He does this by reviewing the various experiences of staging Brecht's classic "Mother Courage and Her Children". For actors dreaming to just plainly "act" in theater (acting a character and not being a character), the good is a good guide. For those dreaming to be the mother in Mother Courage and The Mother, Shente in The Good Person of Setzuan, and St. Joan in St. Joan of the Stockyards--learn from this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Disappointing. Gergen's book is awash with name-dropping, inside baseball, and self-serving reminders of his proximity to power and his influence,,,although the evidence of whether any of the truly powerful accepted his advice or were influenced by him in any meaningful way is scanty. In my judgment, it has been his willingness to pander which has made him a "bi-partisan" figure, rather than true intellect or political savvy (a la Moynihan).I find the book to be the same as the man,,,narcissistic and full of self-promotion. There are much better views inside Washinton.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A bit thin. Ladder of Years was my first experience with Anne Tyler. I was only mildly impressed, because I thought the development of the plot was a bit thin. The book incorporated many real-life situations and emotions, but Tyler was too vague in her descriptions. Tyler left too much to the reader's imagination, which made it a bit difficult to really connect with the characters. It was a constant guessing game throughout the book as too what Delia was really feeling. It was almost impossible because of lack of description to decipher the real reason for Delia leaving, and whether or not she was justifiable in doing so.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Beautifully written summary of scientific knowledge. This book is a terrific, elegantly written (and occasionally funny) summary of the scientific understanding we have about cats. Among other things, its useful to know what is really demonstrated and what is just folklore. And yes, cats are just as unique as we think they are. Although solidly based on research, the book is written in a journalistic style that is easy to read. I am a high school biology teacher and read a lot of science, Budiansky is one of the very best of the popularizers. Parts of this book are so eloquent, I plan to read them aloud to my classes.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Choppy - could have been better.... I agree with other reviewers - 2 hours is insufficient. It seems like the movie is broken into 3-5 minute segments of the most important scenes in the book.

Great Buy!. Best backpack I've ever owned! Plenty of useful pockets. If you're not sure what to put in all those pockets, it even has little square hardware symbol logos sewn into the inside of each pocket... and there's a legend in the main compartment that explains each symbol. The handle is a big plus. It wears comfortably, and is made of water resistant material. The Mp3 pouch holds an external HD perfectly, though it's weight makes the bag slouch, especially when the main compartment is open. The file pocket is great for keeping bills and other paperwork separate. Great design overall, my wife wanted it when I walked in with it on my shoulder... I'll have to get her the Metro by Ogio, she liked that one too. Very nice laptop backpack in every way.$LABEL$1,0,-100
fuzzies up in the wash. this blanket was beautiful when it arrived and I washed by itself it before use. It got fuzzies ALL over it, plus a big ball of fuzzies in the dryer screen. I tried washing it again and using a different brand of dryer sheet and still fuzzies and another ball of fuzzies in the dryer screen. I tried using a tape roller on it (like for pet hair), it got some of the fuzzies but not all of them. but of course they come off and stick to my clothes! I will try putting this in the dryer again on no heat, to try to get the fuzzies off.this is too bad. I've purchased from Warm Things in the past and had good things to say. this blanket is a real dud. assuming i can't get the fuzzies off with an hour in the dryer on cool i will be contacting Warm Things to see if i can return this.UPDATE: Warm Things allowed me to return this item.

Flows through you like water. Tori's music is always reflective of her life, like any artist. At the same time, an artist continually explores technique to add to their base of knowledge. Tori always injects these things into her music...that is what makes her the great artist that she is. To Venus and Back...the new material...is more about atmosphere than clear expression of emotion ... more evident on Little Earthquakes. I like the fact that the words and their meanings are not so immediate...they too become atmospheric. She is masterful at the use and combinations of sounds and uses her voice more instrumentally here. I am a big fan, and this recording (live set is excellent too... those pining for "the old Tori" will appreciate it) is as great as all her other ones.$LABEL$1,0,-100
