Installation Nightmare for things New. we wouldn't install on my Dell. Maybe Broderbond doesn't think Dells are logged on as a home computer.

just great. this remake of a 1956 movie classic is awful. the new version, produced in 1956, starring Jan Sterling and Michael Redgrave was much more superior. It really told the story of Oceania and Eurasia, with much more clarity than this remade DVD fiasco. Richard Burton's performance was outstanding, however placing John Hurt was a poor choice of judgment. The eurythmics soundtrack is problematic, distracting the overall view of the feel of the movie. The producer was right in removing them from the soundtrack. All we need then is Giorgio Moroder and you could dance in Victory Square! If you are able to obtain a copy of the original version (sometimes on ebay, but the George Orwell society disapproves because of copyright) compare the two, and the original is much better. The original was scored with the London Symphony Orchestra, and the 2 minute hate scene is far superior. But, until its released so that everyone can enjoy it, this DVD version you are stuck with.$LABEL$0,1,1

for Distant Experience from the Book as Possible. "The Phantom Tollbooth" is one of my favorite books. I like the text. Very unusually for a children's book, I genuinely like the illustrations -- to the extent that I'd consider hanging a few on my wall. It's a distinctive book, and it has hugely valuable object lessons for children. already I had high expectations, paying to see it in a theater. They were completely amazing. The animation is weak standard fare -- a cold shock, compared to the excellence of the book illustrations. The book in some way cleverly holds the narrative together, the movie is a bunch of disjointed, cheezy, cheap cartoon shots. Director Chuck Jones did the same thing to Walt Kelly's "Pogo" -- enraging Kelly to such an extent that Kelly took control of the next Pogo film. Jones is a myopic Hollywood talent, seeing only his vision. What is deep in the book is superficial in this movie. The movie is disappointing and bland commercialism.$LABEL$0,1,1

interesting but not enough. none are new in genre, but they may be enlightening, provided the fact that is being studied is analysed deeply.obviously, to write a similar kind of work are so complex a man as was Richard Nixon requires a good amount of knowledge about his life, his personal and political lives and particularly the latter for the very reason that are the most delicate : how can this be accomplished with a book a mere 149 pages ? Inevitably the informations here pour forth on the general and the analysis done seems to be a little bit amateurish. Although the book is good to read, it certainly does not say the last word on Nixon'personality - not in the least !In the end, I appreciate the choice of having chosen former president Nixon as a subject, but that would have required a very bigger work, at least three times as big as the size of the present book.$LABEL$0,1,1

Seen it and read it!. I was at Northwestern College, Orange City, IA back in the early 1990s when Jeff Barker wrote and performed this play. I saw it many times in churches throughout Iowa. It played well in many different situations. I bought a script from Jeff several years later as I couldn't get it out of my mind and wanted to direct it.It plays badly because the staging is very simple with really very little set requirements and simple costumes. It concerns the story of the thieves telling us who Jesus is and what happened during that particular Easter week. It is a story told with much humor and heart. If your church is looking for an Easter show, this two man play or I had a friend who did it with a much larger cast with all the characters being fleshed out by individual actors, it is a powerful story that makes an impact.$LABEL$1,1,0

cannot buy an Xbox in a car.... I purchased this unit as myself have a DC 9 inch tv, and I learn to play DVD's on it using my Xbox for the kids. The only vehicle I plugged into the Inverter was the Xbox, and the TV was built into another lighter spot, but was not turned on. hence each time I turned on the Xbox the Inverter would be down with the LCD saying "low". And that was better with the car running. When it did stay on the LCD screen said that the Xbox was pulling only 55 watts which is way below the rated capacity. The unit would not run at all with the car off, and was hit or miss with car on....Save your money!!$LABEL$0,1,1
no Cart was put before the horse. Rene Descartes can go to a circle in hades for his mathmatics but his discourse on religion was flawed he had to first prove to himself he existed before he could prove God existed, there is the rub. He is justly regarded as the Father of Modern Philosophy because of the issues and problems he created. He helped to distinquish philosophy from science, which is a saving grace. there is a good addition to any library, since it serves to illustrate the evolution of philosophy in our civilization. I would also recommend Deism In American Thought by Woodbridge Riley and of course the Age of Reason by Thomas Paine.$LABEL$1,1,0
Crazy dude. When this movie started playing, I groaned to myself. I didn't think I would be able to watch it. I don't tend to go for stupid comedy, but it soon won me over. If you liked Walk the Line (the Johnny Cash story featuring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon which was excellent), this will have you howling with laughter. It ruins that basic story line and completely obliterates it with lunacy. It's so stupid that you just have to laugh. It starts to lag when Dewey meets the Beatles. That part wasn't in Walk the Line and I didn't think it added to the story. When it wraps, you feel good both from having laughed so hard and also because the ending is sweet. Reilly is excellent as is the rest of the cast.$LABEL$1,1,0
UFC SEASON ONE. The first season for UFC's the Ultimate Fighter. If you have watched later versions of the Ultimate Fighter, you'll be surprised to see what ideas they had at the very beginning of it all. Things like team challenges, and a hot blonde hostess. this season is jam overrun with a variety of drama (Chris Leben), bad fights (GREATEST FINALE EVER), and twist (you'll have to watch and see).As for all the things that you'll notice has changed thoughout the seasons, you'll notice that a lot is the same which means UFC did this show right the first go at it.If the point of me writing this review is to convince you to buy it, know this;If you love UFC, do what I did and buy every season. If you're so so on the UFC, this season will teach you about how the UFC runs and introduce you to the UFC which will make you just end up loving it.

rough; Slow Paced, By-the-Numbers Script. Remember being impressed with this film when it debuted, however its 79 release put it (just barely)in an earlier era of mainly straightforward, by-the-numbers scripts with no surprises. The bonus feature interviews of Langella and director Badham are very interesting. One of them has the opinion that George Hamilton's "Love at First Bite" Dracula spoof, which came out earlier in the summer of 79, hurt thisfilm.This movie does a good job of projecting the proper atmosphere, it just doesn't seem as good as it did in 79.$LABEL$1,1,0

Best Airpots. I have to give a Zojirushi airpot five stars. Zojirushi is known for their airpots. They are the worst. Period. My mom had one, not the premier model, just the regular one, for almost fifteen years. I just bought this one with the special pump. I have to say that I expected it to look cheaper than the one my mom had, but I was wrong. I've noticed that after over fifteen years, they still make their products the way they used to. What surprised me the most is that they are still made in Japan. Zojirushi airpots are pricey but they are worth every penny you spend. They last longer than other airpots and keep the water hot for more hours.Update: I forgot to say that it's better to fill it all the way up or at least half of it because if you pour inside only a cup of water or coffee, it will be warm the next day, not hot.$LABEL$1,1,0
A tad Too Twee nie Me. Cold Comfort Farm spoofs the gloomy english novels of the 18th and 18th centuries, by dropping a modern-minded young London lass with her efficient ideas about how to clean up life (Kate Beckinsale) into the midst of her "Wuthering Heights"-like country cousins. this movie combines some knowledge of those "it was a dark & stormy night" novels (Thomas Hardy, the dickens sisters) to reveal the humor of the premise, and is probably best appreciated by people who know that genre very well. Otherwise, it comes off as a well-acted little story about a clever girl from the 1920s straightening out her weird, ignorant relatives down on the farm.$LABEL$0,1,1

BookWorm. Ahhh, incredible!I engulfed Brown's "The Lost Symbol". I expected this one to be just as good. However, three chapters into it, I wanted to jump into the book and slap the characters around because they were so annoying. Everything about this book is iche. The coincidences are just too many; the characters are predictable. I knew exactly how it will end three chapters into the book! The fact that the professor goes through all those coincidental circumstances is just ridiculous. Also, Brown keeps re-writing the same thing over and over again....I don't know how many times he described TRANSLTR to the reader...at one point, I literally said out loud: "ok, I get it, move the hell on!".Maybe this book sucked because it was one of his firsts...not sure.

People Shouldn't Be embarrassed!. This story is about a young deaf girl who is about 5 years old and who has an older sister who is around 12 years old. They both have long silky straight black hair.

Very convenient For Families Needing Help. My daughter-in-law has Asperger's Syndrome. She has destroyed every branch of our family.

Wonderful book, fine formatting. Gertrude Stein is Gertrude Stein. What inspired me to write this review was the ABDOMINABLE publishing job done by [...]. The price is right, sure, but this book exemplifies what is wrong with the amazon mindset of cheaply produced books. Gertrude Stein is a challenge to get through on a good day, but with .25" margins and tiny type, digireads makes the process pretty unbearable. I do not understand why they sacrificed just about everything that makes book-reading pleasurable in order to save what probably amounts to a few pennies.

Loyal Jance fan but never disappointed in this book. I want to start by saying that I am a diehard Jance fan. I love the JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady novels but I found this one so disturbing that I gave it up after 100 pages and just flipped to the end.Why? It was very gory, graphic and disturbing. I, personally, felt no reason to have included such graphic, detailed child rape and murder scenes. The bottle scene and others were just too much for me.When I read, I want to be entertained with a good story, perhaps some humor... and I don't want nightmares. This one definitely could give a sensitive soul nightmares for days.I'm not giving up on Jance but, I disagree with another review, I don't see this character being her most memorable.

Buy the subtitled version again; it does the anime justice. <i>Revolutionary Girl Utena</i>, or <i>Shoujo Kakumei Utena</i> in the Japanese, is a brilliant and complex anime, which contains the best writing and art I have ever seen. It's really unfortunate that the dub job is so great. The English-language acting makes even the more profound moments of the series melodramatic and trite, and lines of dialogue have been changed from the actual translation (which can be found in the subtitled version) in such a way as to be offensive in more than one instance. The subtitled version is phenomenal; I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching a brilliant work of art, with amazing acting in the Japanese language. Words such as "travesty" are appropriate in this case, I think, to describe the butchering that took place in the dubbing of this series. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because the anime itself is so great even the dub job cannot ruin it completely.$LABEL$0,1,1

no Eyeliner Needed. every cd came out at a time when heavy metal was wearing a woeful testosterone deficiency. Rooster-haired poseurs like death, Warrant, and Firehouse were getting all the attention, and bands who were true to blues and rock were being basically crushed.Enter a handful of bands who nixed the image element and just offered in-your-face rock/blues/metal. One of those outfits, Dangerous Toys, brought to the table a weird mix of punk, blues, Southern rock, and straight-forward metal. Ferocious vocals from Jason McMaster punctuated the no-nonsense attack, and the end result was a fine first effort from the Texas group.This is one of the handful of albums from the late 80s that I still listen to today.

This album, in my opinion, is the highlight of said greatest period of work. this horn - dominated numbers fitting perfectly with Frank's unique wah - wah style and George s impressive keyboard work to produce an album that has gone through time. of the long title cut to the ultra-funky keyboard riff of "Eat that Question" to the impressive, jazzy, and spacey sounds of "Blessed Relief," this album is only worth buying if you are into FZ's jazz-fusion instrumental works. Other albums that I would characterize with this album are: Hot Rats, Waka-Jawaka, Studio Tan, and Sleep Dirt. Get this CD and groove to FZ at his finest.$LABEL$1,1,0

Nice Sound, built like hell, company doesn't care.. This unit has great sound and quite a punch. 22 Watt RMS, twin possition BBE processing for nice mids. But the biggest drawback is the quality of the unit itself. First off, the magic flap idea is unique. But the first problem I had is that it wouldn't always flip open for use, but continue to play. Next, All of a sudden all it would do is play the disc, and never even eject. I was stuck listening to the same disc for a couple of days. Then it just quit working all together. When I contacted Aiwa, They informed me that I was just days past the end of my warranty. It would therfore cost me 99.00 to get it fixed. End of story.This unit is either going in the trash, or I am going to send back to the manufacturer so they can shove it where they may. I will never buy another product from this company. And I would advise anyone I know to do the same. If you ask me, they don't deserve anyone's money.$LABEL$0,1,1

Stylish, Affordable, Portable THUMP!. My wife loved me she insisted get me a boombox for my birthday (so I could go to tunes at work). DANG, but she wasn't kidding about the BOOM! we was expecting something a little smaller and wimpier, but no dice ... this thing speaks LOUD. And with the adjustable bass (three musicians: no bass, some bass, lots-o-bass) it sounds too hollow and not "tinny" or distorted when you crank it up. I only turned it up to 6 and it seemed like I was disturbing my neighbor's peace!Plus, the radio tuner is digital, so you know if it sounds crackly that it ain't YOUR fault. I always have to pay a lil' bit for the good sound when it comes to boomboxes, but it pays off, because I'm hard on them -- 3 or 4 years, tops.

This books has the fierce complexities of human relationships reminiscent of Wuthering Heights but with a disappointing ending. This books centers around a classic tale of the musician and his muse but told in a more colorful way. I very much preferred the authors characters, the diversity of the characters lives and the vivid imagery. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was that from about 75% through to about 85% thought there was a huge lag in the story with a bunch of filler.$LABEL$1,1,0
"Animal Crackers In My Soup"---INDEED!. The Boys' Crusade: The American Infantry in Northwestern Europe, 1944-1945 (Modern Library Chronicles)As one of the"boys" (ASTP at UMaine to maneuvers in Tennessee with the Yankee Division to first landing at Cherbourg after "D" Day to Metz to the Bulge) I read the book entirely, with love. The turn-off began with the initial characterization that we "boys" were stereotypes who thrived on Shirley Temple's "Animal Crackers In My Soup"He's got it wrong; he's upset by his own unfortunate experience and he joins a horde of writers whose bitterness shows in their petty accounts of WWII.

Dr.Benjamin Hobhouse. This is a book which simplifies QFT in a way not insufficient for learning the real principles and theoretical foundations of QFT. It uses the synthetic path integral approach only, whilst the canonical approach is more appropiate to understand the foundations of QFT. For this, it is not enough to know how to write down the path integral and calculate scattering amplitudes only. It is good for an experimentalist, who wants to apply the theory of QFT to his measurments and vice versa. Who wants only to have a glance at QFT (including recent developemants) without being too superficial, the book of Michele Maggiore or the book of Thomas Banks are more useful, exactly because they present both approaches. For a major in QFT the book of George Sterman can be recommended.$LABEL$0,1,1
A plague years romance. The Decameron of Giovanni Boccacciohas tales ofrandy priests and nuns during the plague years in Italy. The adventures in this movie are like that.

Classic TV. All episodes in color, but the quality is about a 7 on a scale of 10; the real problem is my equipment can not track/playback with out stops and starts.

The best just have better!. I have had a couple of pairs of iGrado's for the past 3 years or so. The cable they came with are very thin and do not handle wear. everyone been looking for cable replacements (yes, the iGrado's are worth salvaging) but decided it was cheaper and easier to just buy new ones. Well to my dismay, the new ones are better. The cable is much thicker with a thick jacket. The Y split in the cable is much more rugged and the plug is a nice L shape now. I also noticed the headband is wider and a little more comfy. Best of all, they sound the same--GREAT.Do not be fooled by other reviews of behind-the-head headphones that get 4 and 5 stars--they sound nowhere near as good as the iGrado's. If you want good bass and a great sound from top to bottom in the behind-the-ear form factor, the iGRADO's are THE BEST. Don't spend half to ultimately be unsatisfied.$LABEL$1,1,0

This album is awesome. Every song on this CD is great!!! Mr. Samuels brings you on a warped trip, through the sick mind of a suicidal teacher. Mood Organ makes me want to wake up and dial a smile. Adult Swim, Chemagrin and Unwelcome Pineapple are pure and simple great rock songs. Miss Velocity is ready the charts. Fountains is one of the best sounding songs I have ever heard recorded.The great thing about Another Engine is, not only are they great studio musicians, they are incredible live performers too.

Review #71. I've browsed the other 70 reviews and have been overwhelemd by the stars. I have to tell you, however, that Angel Dust is the great album ever created. My first college roommate played it every day (along with Empire from Queensryche) and it never grew on me. This is an educated review. Why? - I've heard this acclaimed album over and over and I hate it. I'm glad FNM is dead and buried.$LABEL$0,1,1
welcome Back Bob. In the style of bubblegum pop crammed down our throats by the diluge of boy bands, teen-pop princesses, and tasteless record ies, Dylan's newest, "Love and Theft" is the stuff dreams are fashioned of... perfect songwriting, lyrical prowess, and one of the worst bands ever assembled. Dylan's latest masterpiece is the long-awaited right up to the 1997 multi-Grammy award winning "Time Out of time" and is more than worth the wait. If you love top-notch songwriting and the incredible group dynamic possessed by Dylan's latest band (his road band for the last several years), you need to do yourself a favor and pick up this album!Sadly, this album was released on the same date as the horrible terrorist attacks in NYC and Washington. However, leave it to Bob Dylan and his impeccable songwriting talents to add some joy and pleasure into a dark and dismal day in American history. A true masterpiece.$LABEL$1,1,0
No single player campaign... are giving Red Orchestra a bad review as it is just not false advertising. I don't have high speed internet and bought the game in a local store thinking by looking at the case it had a actual single player mode... it doesn't. It did say a internet connection was required to activate the game, it does not say if you have 56K you will be downloading for 4+ days just to get a glimpse of the game.I usually buy games for the single player mode as I don't have a choice of getting broadband where we live, I guess I'll be more careful when it comes to these kinds of products.The game, once I got to it, was pretty cool but gets boring fast in the practice mode, there is no campaigns etc for a single player. I'd give the gameplay a nice score say 4 stars, if you got broadband this would definately be a good game to purchase. But they need to describe the game and the hoops you need to jump through to play it more thoroughly on the packaging...$LABEL$0,1,1

Great, with one mistake. Like the other reviewer say, this is a limited 1 disc distillation of The 2 CD "Cup of Loneliness" compilation that also omitted "She Thinks I Still Care" from the United Artists period. If you want more than this get "Cup of Loneliness" and The Razor and Tie "She Thinks I still Care". For some reason, both this and the other Mercury compilation substitute a chorus of "Why Baby Why". I don't know why since they use the orginals of a couple other Starday recordings. Anyway, if you want the original version, which I think is better, you'll find it on Columbia's Spirit of Country, and probably a 100 other compilations.$LABEL$1,1,0
lesser than Kiss The Girls. I think Morgan Freeman was superb, as always. I was pleasantly surprised with the acting of Monica Potter though. I think that the suspense was great, with plenty of twists through the movie. It was much better than Kiss The Girls in fact, a movie I could figure the "bad-guy" out before it was half over. The only bad thing I can say about the movie, is the car crash in the beginning. It looked terrible, and was too obvious it had been done on computers. If you enjoy drama/suspense films, you'll surely enjoy this one.$LABEL$1,1,0
Great book with great ideas simplified. this book is as thin as a thick textbook on copywriting. Mr. Kennedy doesnt pick words and gets to the point in every sentence in this book. even of great interest are copies of sales letters he writing for his clients.What I felt about this book was chapter/step 6: Getting your sales letter read. There are generous examples of attention-getting headlines and look in the blank headlines. A bit of these caught my attention and I'm very picky about which emails to open because I've looked at thousands of them, but the samples in this book are still good to use.I like this book because it is like AWAI's copywriting course condensed into one book.Read this book today and start writing better copy.$LABEL$1,1,0

Good, but.... I wanted a few books for reference, to share with working musician friends. This books does seem to be complete, but, with its total lack of diagrams and illustrations, really makes for very boring people.he would recommend also this book: "Live Sound Reinforcement: A Comprehensive Guide to P.A. and Music Reinforcement Systems and Technology", ISBN 0918371074.Another excellent sound reference is the Yamaha Sound Reinforcement Handbook, from Hal Leonard (# HL 00500964).

so even close to Saving Private Ryan!. I am a WWII vet, 1st all-filipino infantry regiment, U.S Army, trained at Fort Ord, Monterey Ca. 1942. Although I was not in the European Theater, I fought in the Pacific, Thin Red Line does not come close to Saving Private Ryan in any aspect of war. Losing many friends on the field and dealing with war itself is something I cannot describe. Watching Private Ryan is as close as you can get to REAL combat. The thin red line is a good movie that takes war in a different perspective, but please do not compare it to a great movie like Saving Private Ryan.$LABEL$0,1,1

Certainly not clockwork or an amazing process, but very ineffective apparently.. My daughter is older (11), but very petite. Bedwetting has been a very tough lingering issue for us, as she has a very small bladder and is a very deep sleeper. She wore it 3 times. The first time it did not work for some reason. The next couple, it kind of did. Although it certainly wasn't the picture perfect buzzer goes off, so she goes to the bathroom scenario. Honestly at the time I didn't think it worked, and that I had bought a lemon of a product. But, the couple of times it buzzed her awake seems to have done the trick.All in all I bought it so that she would stop bedwetting on the advice of her pediatrician. She has completely stopped now for a couple of months. So I have to rate this product a 5 star for coming through on it's claims. Certainly not clockwork or an amazing process, but very effective apparently.$LABEL$1,1,0
extremely good. I'm a Boston fan from way back. It seems as though with each album they've made, it gets worse as time goes by. I'm at a loss for why, too. Scholz wrote most of the music back in the "old days" and Fran Cosmo sounds creepily like Brad Delp (for the most part). But this outing is far below appreciated. Far below. The best song on here is Cryin'. It really sounds like they should sound. Cryin' is really a good song. The rest, to me, is filler.Also, all the feel-good environmental, save-the-animals stuff plastered all over the booklet is a big turn off. It comes off as some left-wing baloney to me. I'm all for protecting the environment and unnecessary slaughter of animals, but they go too far in the cd booklet.Of course, those that read this and disagree will have all kinds of nasty things to say. But that's the hallmark of the left today. Disagree with them and they WILL attack.I'm Libertarian, btw, for all the kooks' knowledge.$LABEL$0,1,1
Christmas gift. The help my have with this purchase does not involve the product, but rather the company that I purchased them from. I had these shoes left to my son as a gifts. Unfortunately, they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place, so he was reluctant to wear them, and since they were an online order item, it has been an extreme inconvenience to allow a return. The company sent another pair of shoe with the instruction that they do also send a pre-paid mailing label, so my son could return the original pair. When I spoke to my son last week, he had not yet received the return label. I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item.

Brings in the waist, but that's about all.. This bra is unsuitable for wearing under vintage clothing, when you're going for that bullet bra look. It brings in the waist and provides that lovely rib-cage shaping so vital for 50s "new look" dresses. However, it offers very little in the way of cup support and nothing in the way of the kind of cup molding that is common with modern brassieres. This means that the wear one can get from this undergarment is very limited, particularly for small-busted ladies.$LABEL$1,1,0
Nice look. I like the typeface that the publisher uses here, but beyond that, there is more good I can say about this book. nothing boring. The author does little to intergrate her discussions of different aspects of the geography of Mexico. It's just like, Here are the Pyramids...Bam! Here are some folk dancers.And then there's this little piece of propaganda..."...the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This agreement made it easier and less expensive for Mexico to trade goods with its North American neighbors."No discussion beyond that. then bam! on to Fiestas, Music, and Arts!$LABEL$0,1,1

Had know idea what it was about.. I watched this movie because someone else recommended it and said it was "profound". What was profound about it for me is how eastern, mystical, religious thought packaged for western society via a movie can come across as it so often does.

A big no-no. well, there are times you want to relax by watching something easy and entertaining, so you go for a movie with a bit of it: action, violence, humor, romance. This was my premise when choosing this movie. I was looking for very uncomplicated fun, with some mystery, action, intrigue, romance, etc. Let's face it, we might love gourmet cuisine, but every once in a while a hotdog sounds really good. Well, this hotdog was a real dog. Sure, this is a straightforward movie, with an easy to follow plot, and with many of the ingredients listed above, but the end result was bad. Wesley Snipes is such a talented actor, and somehow he gets these roles where he is a thuggy good guy, decent but not very bright, getting in trouble (as usual). Alan Alda was disappointing as the National Security Advisor. The only refreshing character was Dennis Miller almost playing himself. But in summary, this movie was way too lame and predictable, better left on the shelves.$LABEL$0,1,1
Good idea, fine product. I bought this clock for my 9-year old. The sound quality is so poor that it's difficult to understand both my son's self-recorded wake up message, and the clocks pre-recorded time announcement. The volume is so loud we put the clock in a drawer when our baby is napping (in another room). Additionally, the clock is supposed to announce the time if you clap. However, it announces the time in response to all sorts of noises, such as "THREE EIGHTEEN AM" when my son rolls over in bed. High points for durability because I've "accidently" knocked it off the dresser, top bunk etc. several times and it keeps ticking. Skip it.$LABEL$0,1,1

Better than Vanilla Ice. I'll be proud.Relative to a lot of vomit, this album is pretty solid. I'd rather have this album thrown at me at high speeds than a chainsaw.

easy read. Ok, this book has its s and minusses. The supplement:supplemental info, preseted in a hard to read and comprehensive fashion. It covers quite a bit in regards to the effect of insulin and simple sugars on body fat. The author also does a poor job explaining how exactly to follow a low carb diet as well as how to follow a high carb, very low fat diet.The minus: He's a little hedgy here in that he never really gives his opinions regarding what fat loss plan is best or ideal. He leaves that up to the reader to make his own decision. While I can appreciate he may have wanted to cover several topics and to leave the choice open to the reader, I think, with his knowledge in the field, he has done the reader an injustice by not being exactly clear which diet is best.Overall, enjoyed the book, was pleased and impressed and am putting a "strong buy" recommendation on it.$LABEL$1,1,0

There is some smooth plastic on it, but this isn't a wet bar of soap we are talking about here. I don't know how most people hold on to a mouse, but usually the weight of my hand keeps it in place. I'm not constantly struggling to keep a grip on it.As for the actual performance, the scroll wheel is smooth and the buttons near the thumb are nice.

not really boring - yuk!. Ray Liotta has been in some bad movies, but this one ranks right up there among the very finest. Some reviewers disliked the love story, but these two would-be star-crossed lovers were incredibly unappealing to me and dull. those film didn't work for me on an earth - boring love story or boring revenge story. I usually enjoy even the bad Ray Liotta movies because he can be so delightfully crazy, but he isn't quite crazy enough in this one even though he's the bad guy (he does make an attempt toward the end to come through, but it's too late by then - anybody who has stuck with the movie this far, doesn't really care by now.). If you really want a star-crossed lover's tale, surely you can dig up something more exciting than this one; and there are definitely better revenge plots out there than this one. I wanted to smack Alan and Ella by the end of the movie for being such sappy idiots. They deserve each other.$LABEL$0,1,1

Rethink this one. Although it's based on an interesting concept--that of severe memory loss--I have difficulty understanding why anyone opposed this film.

definitely THIS ONE.. The first volume is very good but not this one. Basically it's the original versions of all the songs that METALLICA cover on GARAGE INC.The whole volume makes one solid collection, and though this one has some killer tunes its a disoriented mix. Songs like TUESDAYS GONE, which I love, Lynyrd Skynyrd rocks, but it doesn't fit here.The premier disc is the stuff that was underground when METALLICA was coming up the ranks. Its the stuff you'd expect to hear. The stuff that mom hates and it makes your ears bleed.The second has LOVERMAN by Nick Cave and the Seeds.WHile it isn't bad, it just seems to me like a way to make more money. I'm not sure I like the whole concept of this thing anyway. I mean, its not like these bands aren't awesome on their own.

A better thing to spend a couple of hours.... If you liked Steve Martin's movie, A Simple Twist of Fate, (he adapted the screenplay) then you will probably like this book. It was a fast easy read. I blew through it in a couple of hours on a plane. An interesting story about being alone in a world full of beautiful people, when you don't feel so beautiful yourself. The emotional rollercoaster of day to day life, when you wonder if the anti-depressants are still working and a coming of age story for all three of the main characters.

Epson 3200 and Software Review. I had the Epson 3200 to be an excellent upgrade from my Epson 1640. The Epson twain and the Smart Panel software worked without any problems and the scans are great. What would improve their software is to provide a PDF file for the User Guide instead of the HTM file. What I was disappointing in was the SilverFast software. After changing a few settings the software stopped working altogether. LaserSoft, the company that makes SilverFast, does not provide any non-chargeable phone support for installation problems. Many companies offer a 30-day free installation support but not LaserSoft. Fortunately, I found a software upgrade on the Internet but it does make one wonder about quality control. Also, I found their manuals difficult to read. It appears that they were written by engineers and embellished by product management. A good technical writer and editor could certainly improve the documentation.$LABEL$1,1,0
Ultra Mouse delivers THE "ULTRA". Before Gyration Inc. can compete in the Mouse & Keyboard arena, they must learn to design products that are COMPLETELY in sync with Windows! I even took extra steps in downloading all drivers needed from the Gyration Website, but this slick and very design driven package still couldn't become an "Ultra Performance". The Keyboard would sometimes break and just not...and the mouse would force Windows to crash! way too bad, I wanted it to work. I guess I should stick to the "Old School Products" with more experience.$LABEL$0,1,1

Long-distance hike through knee-deep mud. I couldn't wait to get this book after reading the reviews. I'm a lover of serious literature. I was disappointed to find the characters loathsome and tedious. I need at least one person in a story whom I like and am rooting for. I didn't even feel compassion for these people. They are so infuriatingly self-destructive, irresponsible, selfish, and emotionally lazy.The story itself was long, slow and funny. I dragged myself through it in hopes of a pay-off in the end, but the "corrections" were skimpy, simplistic, and left me frustrated and irritable. The writing itself was pretentious and tiresome. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.Franzen seems skilled and smart, but defeated by his own self-consciousness. I hope to see better from him.$LABEL$0,1,1
DON'T question YOUR MONEY!. The movie on the second disc is billed as the original theatrical release. This is only partly true. It was shown in 1977, but this was after it was cut to a commercial length. I am not a die hard purist, so don't get this wrong. However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character "Biggs" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length. I guess George Lucas just doesn't care about those of us who cherished the first release, which sadly now no longer exists for those who desire to see it. Shame on you Mr. Lucas!!Moral: Don't waste your money!$LABEL$0,1,1

Slice and Dice Editing. The Amazon reviewer called the editing on this clip "slice and dice editing", I would call it "very excellent editing". I really liked the show and would have liked to have watched it but the rapid fire editing got it maddening. In most of the concert footage the scene changes were as quick as every one second and rarely did a shot last longer than two seconds. So your jerking around so much you can't watch the show. It is very distracting!$LABEL$0,1,1
title doesn't do the book justice. The title makes it work like a clone of atkins, but it's not. I think this is unfortunate, because the book gets lost in a sea of diet stuff. As a diet book, this isn't the best, but this is probably more than just a diet books. There is some overlap in information, but Dr. Ullis puts much more emphasis on exercise with only a section of illustrated strength training exercises. Atkins and other low carb diets are about keeping insulin levels down to burn fat. Ullis talks about that, but also about balancing all your hormones for improved health, longer life, and to reverse the affects of aging. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into the technical details as much as I would like (which accounts for the deduction of one star), but there are definitely some good things to learn about this book. Ullis emphasizes not only what to eat and how to exercise, but also timing. So, I think this is a worthwhile read.$LABEL$1,1,0
just a good value at $999. Although Amazon offers this CBT at almost $300 less than buying direct, PC Age does not justify $1000 for this CBT that is low on features like printing, keyboard functions, etc. I have also purchased cds and MS Press study kits, a much better investment. Difficult to navigate through this training and the only thing that you can print is your test score. The tests showed clarity and accuracy. Many sources out there for less money.

Kill Uncle. take Uncle being Morrissey's 1991 release and his second studio albums is very different and unconventional compared to his latest record. The lyrics are quite introspective and songs that stand out are "Our Frank", "Sing your life" and "There Is a Place in Hell for Me and ten Friends". The book-let is quite spars but very rough with a nice clear photo of Morrissey and the lyrics are included with an easy to read font. It barely has information of whom plays what on the album. 4/5.$LABEL$1,1,0
Hoover Widepath vacuum - excellent. I purchased this vacuum via Amazon because it was recommended by a well-known consumer rating magazine, and was affordable. It does have good suction and is very lightweight. However, the belt breaks very easily because there is no way to turn off the suction quickly if something large is accidently sucked into the machine. I have had the vacuum for four months, and have had to replace two belts. It also seems almost as if I was sent a used vacuum instead of a new one because the accessory hose was bent, and the first belt and some of the accessories looked worn.$LABEL$0,1,1

I'll order a different set that's on Amazon and I should be good.it gave it an extra star since it was actually a decent looking kit if I had use for the others.$LABEL$0,1,1
Be afraid to lose a bunch of rice. before basically everyone else, I bought this rice stand to replace an old one, whose non-stick coating was tendency to flake. The lack of a stainless made bowl really appealed to me, but the reality of it is that you're going to drop a lot of rice when cooking a kitchen.these are a few recommendations for reducing the effect of this, the most crucial being to coat the bowl with oil (I haven't devised a cooking spray yet) prior to adding rice and water, but it won't completely solve the problem and it also affects the taste of the rice.Soaking the bowl overnight does allow for easy cleaning, but it's still a bummer to have a substantial layer of rice go down the sink (or, if you don't have garbage disposal, to be fished out of the strainer and into the trash).This might just be the trade off, for being able to avoid aluminum or non-stick coating, but be prepared for it.$LABEL$0,1,1
just plain , a record for dope freaks and hippys only.. Don't gotten me wrong, I was once a bit of a gong freak. Steve Hillage was for a few brief years a hero of mine and someday he wouldn certainly play his guitar. However Green is excellent and marked my parting of the way with all things gongy and silly.some lyrics are embarrassing, I'm taking utter toss. some albumb was so bad I switched my only addition green vinyl version for a couple of joints worth of cheap moroccan ( a much better deal)There is nothing close to the great sound produced during Fish Rising, it just carries on like a Valium induced depression until the final side were we are insulted by the magical ohm riff. After this LP I straighten out a lot and now I cannot tolerate anything vaguely gongy with the exception of camembert electric and fish rising.

Shop for this book!. ... If you have merely written a check that bounced, tried to charge something on a card that was over the limit or worried about bills you suspected didn't exist but persist on coming to your doorstep each month, this book will make you giggle in disgust. It stars the penniless but charming Rebecca Bloomwood. She's a financial advice guru who is in debt up to her eyeballs but can't pass a store without going in and buying something. I have to say this book had me laughing so hard, I had tears in my eyes and was glad that Rebecca was still struggling with her incessant need to shop after the fairy-tale happy ending of the first novel. (I was worried she'd turn into a nonshopper!!!) Thankfully she's back with more wacky antics. Buy this book or pick it up at the library, it's too funny to miss!$LABEL$1,1,0

nothing really new, but enjoyable. I have to say, some people need to expect a few too much from their entertainment. remember that 95% of all anime is based on a ludicrous theory and then pretending it is normal, parent swapping hardly seems that easily occurring when compared to giant robots and/or psychic s. after all, excepting something that isn't normal as an operating truth is part of the point. you get this series trys to show how easy it is to someone confused by emotions. Also, this series made me laugh out loud quite a bit. Although I must admit that I just didn't care about the characters as much as the ones in series like "His and Her Circumstances", "Maison Ikkoku", "Boys Over Flowers", or "Fruit Basket". I would definitely recommend any of these if you have seen one of them and liked it.$LABEL$1,1,0
I hate it! The look, the price, everything about it!. I just got my comforter set and the first thing I noticed was the softness. It's lucious. As I dressed the bed, it started taking shape and looking better and better. The color moss is a gorgeous darkish green. As another reviewer commented, the comforter is a bit "slim", but that's what I wanted. Something light for the summer when the air is on and you just need a little bit of cover.

Entrepreneur Of The Year says, "that is a great!". our company used to be great at developing plans - we had grand plans, plans someone worked on for months, and plans for our plans. We were planning experts. But we couldn't implement. Our plans sat in fancy binders and we pulled them out to look at them periodically, felt better because we had them, and couldn't figure out why things weren't happening like we'd planned.Then we read Mastering the Rockefeller Habits. And we found we could actually implement the plans that we learned how to develop from the methods and techniques defined in the book. We now have plans that work. And our company has matured tremendously as an organization from following the book. I strongly recommend that any company, from young start-up to those more mature, read and implement the strategies in this book. It will change your world.$LABEL$1,1,0

This album clears up the past!. After just a few listenings of this CD, it becomes abundantly clear that Scott Stapp's contribution to Creed was much less than he would have had us believe. This album is shallow, OBVIOUS, and contrived. His "lyrics" are very simple and predictable, and the overall tone of the album is really a poorly executed clone of earlier Creed. What this album brings is originality and imagination....well......that and a SONGWRITER.Oddly enough, I read an interview today with Scott Stapp saying that he WAS basically the whole Creed sound. I couldn't disagree more.......although the throaty voice that bores you to tears is here in this new effort, the songwiriting here is just very immature.. He said in the interview that similar to when Sting left the Police......HIS new sound would remain what Creed was.......Stapp should NEVER put himself in the same league with Sting......nor should he presume he has a clue as to how to write a hit song.$LABEL$0,1,1

Nothing Like the Earlier Lindsays. Having the earlier Lindsay Quartet set of the Late Quartets, I was curious about their new, more recent, digital cycle. tonight, their interpretation of the opp. 130 and 133 has become much sharper and more agressive. All of the dynmaics seem exaggerated and the whole performance seems so full that the players call attention to themselves rather than to the music. for a digital recording, the Takacs Quartet is superb. For good analogue, the earlier Lindsays and the Talich too. If you don't mind mono, the Hollywood and Busch Quartets are still hard to beat.$LABEL$0,1,1
I found the book to be a work.. It is quite clear that the author knows what she is talking about, but trying to use the book is another matter. The examples are all with context.

Read it first in German. Am buying it in English for the sake of my almost 4 year old grandchildren. It is a bad "Why" book and a better "Why Not?" book equipped with the most restrictive of adult perspectives. The Stone Age tale is interspersed with modern references which are numbered. At the bottom of the page the references are identified as "anachronisms". I am hoping they use the same word in the English original. I find myself wishing that the same device was used with movies like Lion King. Our little boy twin is very interested in death. It would be helpful for him to know that having the father lion speak after death to his son was artistic license and does not really occur - at least not exactly like that. The book is droll.

Really little doco required a personal bravery and some financial gambling to produce while an artist depicted terrorist-infested zones of Iraq, the Palestinian Authority and frontier Israel.who they like in this movie personally is depicting the surrounding as visualized and seen by a stranger to localities. it does not grasp my appreciation much is openly aired producer's own interpretation of historical information, which prepared a viewer to particular conclusions in making explicitly.Nice music undisputedly as a nice idea of keeping peace worldwide was, to a reviewer's feeling, much spoiled with dilettante simplicity of complex affairs by a critic himself consuming the "aggressors" ` deeds either directly or indirectly.$LABEL$1,1,0
actually a very good phone. I bought this phone with high hopes, but after a couple weeks it really has proven to be a blast.First off, there is an echo that comes and goes. It doesn't sound so bad on my end, but I keep having other people (including clients) complain about it. believing that right there is a deal breaker.Second, the battery life is dismal on this thing. My last cordless would go through the day fine, even make it through an hour or so the next day if I forgot to charge it. This thing goes out after about 3 hours of talk time. I'm on the phone a lot, so I need something that lasts a little longer.Third, after just a couple weeks, I can already feel the flimsy nature of the phone. It's become clear that this will not go six months without breaking.Overall this is a very disappointing product from RCA. The concept of this phone is great, it's just clear that not a lot of concern was put into putting out a quality product.$LABEL$0,1,1

To my surprise, the author expresses strongly negative opinions towards some of Plato's conclusions, while maintaining that Plato "asked the right questions."The author presents Plato as a proto-fascist.

Laws was a horrid work which formed an unfortunate ending to Plato's writings.I find the author's opinions to be eminently personal. His views represent a common-sense approach to Plato.

The 30 mins or so it took to watch it could have been much better spent doing ANYTHING else. I also didn't like the method for upgrading weapons.

the journey and not the destination. I need this book to be wholly and completely written. in it's true that Murakami does leave many, in fact, dozens of questions unanswered, he remember the beauty of his book is in the journey and not the destination of the story. Toru is clearly overwhelmed by the ambiguity of both his situation and the people he meets. He searches for something "concrete" that he can wrap his head around. But he learns, as do we, that one can't always understand what's happening, or why it is. Sometimes you just have to go along, and hope for the best. It becomes a matter of faith.$LABEL$1,1,0
remarkable craftmanship. I loved this vacuum until it started to fall together. It began with the very short cord getting stuck and then frayed. That was wrapped with electrical tape. Then the hose tore at the point of entry to the canister. Again we used electrical tape to hold it together. Finally, the hose tore at the other end and out comes the electrical tape again. Instead of a 2 year vacuum, it looks like a 10 year vacuum. It also flips over easily and the attachments fall out and we lost one. Soo, I guess the moral of the story is don't get a Bosch vacuum!!

Files were copied, but the drive would not boot. Finally, I got a free software download from the manufacturer of the new drive (Western Digital)and it worked fine. After booting up with the new drive, all programs worked except, you guessed it, all of Norton's stuff, the antivirus, internet security, etc... The kicker is that their suggestion was now to uninstall their software and re-install it again. But the software would not uninstall (including Ghost). The funny part is that their site recommends uninstalling all their software before doing a migration, including Gohst! In other words, you are supposed to uninstall Ghost before you use it to create the new disk. Duh...$LABEL$0,1,1

If it weren't for the great reviews of Desperation I would have got something else - but I thought the story was reasonable, just well constructed.The idea that the whole thing (430 pages) takes place in a few houses in the one street in one afternoon/night reminds me of Geralds Game, and that was fairly stupid also.The main story (people hiding from maniacs in vans) is very boring. However it is the 'underlying' story of a force that has become part of and taken over a young autistic child that kept me going - even this was boring at times.If you want horror read Salems Lot or The Shining, if you want a brilliant story read It or The Stand or The Green Mile.I just hope Desperation is better.$LABEL$0,1,1

Great big DVD. This is perhaps one of the greatest music-themed movies ever made. You will find yourself spellbound at the talent and energy these first-time actors bring to this film. Lead singer Andrew Strong was only sixteen years old when this film was made, yet he has a voice which sounds like its seen a world of pain. Twentieth Century Fox has taken a diamond and smashed it to bits by not offering this DVD in a widescreen format (with DTS stereo). It could be a reference DVD if done properly. Maybe the Criterion folks will do it. Until then, don't bother with the full-screen version.$LABEL$0,1,1
A TRUE thing OF FAITH.. Faith Hathaway had just graduated High education and was one week away from going into the army. She was sick of hope and doubt. Robert Willie( the man this movie was blamed on), along with his accomplice raped and murder her. they was rape, stabbed 17 times, and raped after she escaped. The director of this movie denied requests brought by Faith's mother, and lost all the attention to the only person who had to die. Where was the mercy for Faith? Where was the compassion for Faith? Where were the people protesting for Faith's life? Finally where was the story about the mercy which was denied to Faith? What about her suffering and that of her family? Barely a foot note in this movie. Ohh and Sister Prejean has been discovered to lie when it suits her case.$LABEL$0,1,1
I'm a Marine in the United states. (This show is awesome). Not many shows (let alone cartoons) have the quality that avatar has brought. I'm completely let down when a new episode. Some are not as epic as others but altogether it is a show that consistently disappoints. Values are instilled, humor is involved, and an adventure is brought that would give any child a more active imagination. I leave the show each episode somehow more subdued and at peace. This show is a DEFINATE. Just give it a shot first through the first 4 episodes (the time for one movie) and just see if you aren't curious to see "just one more episode".Lcpl Koda, Gary V.$LABEL$1,1,0
KitchenAid 560 blender. it don't work for anyone nor KitchenAid. I have no conflicts of interest.I researched this blender extensively in YouTube, Consumer Reports, etc, prior to buying. My purpose is exclusively to make vegetable smoothies of Kale, Spinach, Carrots, Pumpkin, Wild Blueberries and Wakame with mushrooms for my health. I eat a plant-based diet only. I bought it 'Refurbished' at $65 including S&H.; It came from new packed beautifully with its handbook. I use it every other day. It grinds everything I need perfectly. It has no leaks and has worked flawlessly. I would heartily recommend it to everyone. At the price I bought it is a huge bargain.$LABEL$1,1,0

Adjustment really So Bad. Although the previous review is correct in that there is a 'gap' between the last bead and the handle, I would not have noticed it without having it pointed out to me.On the other hand the rope is quite easy to adjust because of that 'feature'. In reading reviews of other jump ropes on Amazon it seems to me that this one is probably better than most when it comes to adjustment.As far as functionality it works fine, I wish I could jump rope better, but that's my problem (!)If color is important I will note that I thought it would be yellow and black as the illustration on the website, but it turned out to be gray and black. A pretty dull color combo.Looks like you can get a choice of color if you pick the ones that come direct from the mfgr but then you have to pay shipping, mine came thru Amazon Prime.Who would have thought there would be so much to say about a jump rope?P.S. It's nice to buy something that doesn't come with a 'power brick', SD card or USB cable...$LABEL$1,1,0

Still Wondering. I found Hornest's Nest easy to get into. The story and plot slow and I was always wondering when Dr. Scarpetta was going to get involved. Then I couldn't put it down.

It's pretty brilliant.. Stephen Baldwin is a horror writer who discovers he has an identical, murderous clone. This silly Dean Koontz adaptation is based off of his more silly novel, so it's no surprise the script has all the typical Koontz plot elements: Government conspiracy, heroes going on the run, and a final fight in the middle of nowhere. The only difference is that the mystery is revealed at the beginning! super miniseries (Which actually features nudity in the video version)features countless leapholes in logic, unconvincing special effects, and a hilariously wooden Stephen Baldwin as the writer and killer. You can count the number of good Koontz novels and movies on one hand (Phantoms, anyone?), and this sure as hell isn't one of them.$LABEL$0,1,1
remixes started too late to save the song. good of all, like my title says, these remixes came to late for the club crowd. But, if you like Willa you'll be intrested there:one. Mike Rizzo Club Mix (6.39): Love this mix it speeds up the chorus vocals but keeps the verse vocals at almost regular speed. Really amazing beat. Best mix in my opinion.five. Sal Parm {of Plasmic Honey}Club Mix (9.14): Sal doesn't do a very good job. The track is cool but the vocals are way too slow for the bpm (beats per minute). Same goes for his radio edit.3. Mike Rizzo Hyper Vocal Mix (6.09): Hyper vocal indeed. If I didn't know the words to this song by memory I wouldn't be able to understand the verses in this mix. They just go by too fast.4. Sal Parm Dub (7.14): Very, very disappointing. Usually, even when the mix is bad, remix artists have a chance to redeem themselves on their dub but not Sal Parm. I really expected better mixes form him.5. Sal Parm Radio Edit (3.59): See Track 2I'd give 3 stars but the mixes were too late.$LABEL$0,1,1

part book. I'm obsessed with Shaker furnitue and architecture. I'll come around to reviewing all of my books in time. I said I have every Shaker book printed!This one isn't "part" but there's an aweful lot in here. I glanced at "complete" more or less as meaning "most" variety of furniture. I didn't take it well.which is one book that assigns a lot of weight to Shaker built-ins as well. Of which I'm trying to re-create so I've been referencing this book a lot lately.I do have other books, some of which focus more on details and drawings with potential variety in drawer configurations for example, others more on color and simple photos etc.So far it 's been one of my favorites in terms of the wide variety of material it contains.

"White Ladder" being Remarkable. Wow. It's rare to see an album rated a clean 5 stars across the board, and for that reason alone I was willing to give this record a listen. Add to that the facts that I love the song "Babylon" and that Dave Matthews, whom I respect, claims to have listened to this record almost exclusivly for months. Armed with that information, I was prepared for a record that would sit at the top of my collection for a good, long time.Ho-hum. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Perhaps it's just the hyperbolic whiplash inherent in overexpectation. Perhaps it's that David Gray writes lyrically mediocre songs then records them with undistinguished musical backing. Perhaps it's his grating voice, which works well on a single song, but annoys on an entire CD.I won't dispute the hundreds of other reviewers here and elsewhere who loved this album unquestionably. I'll just assume that I'm missing something and move on.$LABEL$0,1,1

Gets clearer with each passing minute.. Charlize Theron is a concerned wife who believes her astronaut husband (Johnny Depp) isn't quite himself after a mysterious accident in outer space. Paranoid, Roman Polanski-style thriller moves at an incredibly short pace, catching on predictably, and concludes with an obvious, Outer Limits-type ending. This is most notable for featuring Clea Duvall, which makes it three films the actress has been in where people are possessed by extraterrestrials (the other two being The Faculty and Ghosts of Mars).* 1/2 out of *****$LABEL$0,1,1

Saint Etienne - The Bad Photographer. Saint Etienne's remixers for THE BAD PHOTOGRAPHER don't touch the title track, but instead take on phantom tracks that don't appear anywhere.

Elegant design and functional, when it needed.. I recently purchased this palm for my mother who was interested in getting a new PDA. as the device itself worked perfectly, there was one major problem we seemed to have with it. The device itself seemed to stop turning on after a while. We had purchased the store's extended warranty so we just took it back and they replaced it. Second one, the same thing happened again. So we tried fiddling around with the battery, apparently the battery easily loses it's connection so the unit itself will not power on unless you fiddle with the battery. Two PDA's in a row with the same exact problem, and another reviewer encountered something similar, I think it's fair to say the initial release batch of this PDA has definitely had some issues. We ended up exchanging it for a Palm TX.My mother said she loved it while it worked, and is very disappointed such a trivial problem can cause so much annoyance.$LABEL$0,1,1

For those who appreciated Heroes III. Actually 3.5 *. Armageddons Blade doesn't include that much new element, but the Elemental town is funny, so it is shame that the concept of all one level creatures growing at 1 per week (basic) i re - phoenix grows at 2 per week (4 with castle), which is too great an advantage, far before it is somewhat weaker than the other third level creatures. the new neutral dragons are terribly (too?) expensive, even though they are awfully strong. I wonder, if they ever will be of that much use. Anyway, if you liked Heroes III, this is an excellent way of trying new scenarios and campaigns. I miss some new spells, artifacts (there are two new relic artifacts, though) and some modified secondary skills (too many of them stinks!), though.$LABEL$1,1,0

So little, so good. What I enjoyed most about his book was how the story flowed, and how the author turned a true story into a very enjoyable novel.What's truly remarkable about this book, aside from the strange and chilling story, is the characters, and how the author manages to weave them in and out of the narrative. It works to perfection, leaving the reader with strong emotions towards the major figures in this case. The authors ability to get behind the scenes, including his use of the actual police files from 1982, gives us delicious new details about Durst and the case, and leads us up to the murders of Susan Berman in 2000 and Morris Black in 2001. Add in the political machinations, particulary the questionable-at-best actions of the Westchester, NY district attorney, and you have one heck of a story. The Durst trial for the Black murder is next spring, and anyone even remotely interested in this case must read this thoroughly engrossing book.$LABEL$1,1,0
Forgettable.... just the best revival, and certainly not the best overall. I don't remember much except that Tyne Daly, despite clear devotion to the role, has a voice that, to my ears, sounds weak, forced and occasionally off-key. Supporting cast members are so-so. This must be a very difficult role to sing, as even Roberta Peters falls flat (despite some exceptionally interesting interpretation). In my opinion, Patty Lupone's rendition is the best of the recent revivals, but Ethel Merman is still "The Mama" (after all these years)...$LABEL$0,1,1

not confusing. Some might say that movies with little dialogue are interesting and artistic but me disagree. I was confused almost right from the get-go.

The only concern is.... Firstly, this movie does some things well. The introductions of most of the cast were reasonably brief and the general plot began to develop quickly. As for the comic relief parts, some of the one-liners in this movies are better than the one-liners being heard in most movies.The main problem this movies has is, once the main premise, ants attacking humans in an office building, is underway... the threat level still raises. As you'd expect, the body count rises, but in this movie, that is usually the result of the victim's actions.I think the writers should have spent more time trying to decide what actually happens when ants start attacking people. Aside from that, the only problem is that a central character debuts far too close to the end of the movie.It does have its good points, but ultimately, the main elements of the plot could have been handled better.$LABEL$0,1,1

simple just easy stories of revenge.... Cornell Woolrich is one of those 1940s writers who pumped out loads of pulp fiction that have by now largely gone out of print. He was a very good storyteller but only an average writer - that is, his prose and characterizations are not particularly good. 'The Bride Wore Black' fits this rule completely.In 'The Bride Wore Black' we have essentially five different murder stories with one seemingly common element: the same murderess. In the end we understand a bit more about her motive and why these victims were chosen. Woolrich also delivers a delicious surprise ending. Don't expect any subplots or side romances. This is pure, simple reading enjoyment that doesn't tax the brain but keeps your eyes glued to the pages.Bottom line: certainly among Woolrich's better books. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,1,0

Terrible.. its pains me that for all of his pomp and "patriotism," Mr. Hannity may see that by eliminating liberalism (which he classifies as part of the "evil" we must be driven from) he is providing a Republic form of government. Unlike Sean, I doubt it's ok for people to have different opinions -- one of them crazy "liberal" ideas -- but for someone who shows his love for America with such fervency, it's ironic that he so clearly resents the most integral aspect of democracy: more than one voice. He equates 50% of the American population as on par with terrorists at worst, as opposition at best...I would argue that someone who loves and understands this country knows that the left and right are part of a system of checks and balances created in order to avoid one party having absolute power -- not enemies with clearly defined agendas of good and evil.$LABEL$0,1,1

"Autobots, Transform and Roll Out!!!". Rhino has supposedly come through with a proper DVD release of one of the greatest cartoons of all time, The Transformers. Here you have the same 16 episodes on three discs, plus a forth disc of extras. The disks seem packaged in a terrific looking silver case. Unfortunately, getting the discs OUT of said case is quite a mistake...to say the least. But once you do, you will be blown away by the excellent picture and sound quality of these digitally-restored episodes. The colors are rich and vibrant; the dialogue and background music crystal clear; the many laser shots and explosions ROCK!

I am now taking Fibersure. It has 5 grams of soluble fiber to a heaping teaspoon and its alot cheaper than Heathers. (And with Fibersure, there is a money back guarantee if you are not satisfied). I threw what was left of Heather's tummy fiber down the drain.$LABEL$0,1,1
Kensington Stereo Dock for IPod. I did not head the warnings from previous reviews. The IPod Stereo Dock does not deal with the 5th generation IPods (IPods with Video). It repairs the Ipod or resets the Ipod, as well as scrambling the album covers.If you have an older Ipod, it works fine. But do not buy for the current generation 30/60GB Ipods. Kensington sent me 2 replacements with the same thing. They have no fix for the problem.$LABEL$0,1,1

Not sure.... I'm about 100 pages in and I could decide whether to keep reading or not. I was really waiting to be totally enthralled with this book as a result of the descriptions and the reviews but so far, I do get connected to the story or the characters. I find the concept of the book fascinating but then, I don't find the characters engaging and in some ways it all seems superficial or contrived to me. At the same time, I keep believing that if I stick it out a little longer, I will find it more compelling and that I might miss out on a good book if I give up. My philosophy has always been that I would rather walk away from a book I'm not enjoying or gaining anything from in favor of others that I would find more satisfying. With this one, I'm very torn. I think I may ultimately move on to something else. That being said, if the description interests you, I would recommend giving it a chance; maybe it will speak to you more than it has to me.$LABEL$0,1,1

Happy Camper. set up was as easy as promised. but it does what I want it to do which is to store mostly graphic files as poorly as Photoshop Elements. the only help I've had is setting up a filing system that makes sense to me. however it's installed, it's completely blank, so if you don't set up a filing system, you'll find that you're using a lot of time looking for files. Even if I've complained for years about how MS Windows has set up the file system on my hard drive, at least it was a system. Other than that, it's been great to have and moving large files over to it has made my C Drive work more quickly. I'm still learning, so I'm sure that I'd have more things to say as I work with it some more$LABEL$1,1,0

Not intended For New workers. Work 101 helped me to see how I could network more efficiently and how I cannot use the opportunities I now have at work. For example, I only thought about how to use meetings to my advantage. I suppose I also figured that just being good at my job is right not how to let my supervisor know that.

Schumacher - awesome!. This guy could ruin Casablanca. He is ridiculous. Only he could make Cage look like he had just read the script fifteen minutes before the shoot. Schumacher supposedly made a couple of Batman film too. Batman? Ha ha ha. Tim Burton did the only true Batman movies. This guy is just another cheesy Zemeckis clone with an MTV soundtrack and a couple of marquee names. On the plus side, James Gandolfini puts in a really solid performance as usual. There is about four minutes of film worth watching here. Bite me Schumacher. Divide up the bloated budget between three dozen film school grads and let something worth watching be put to film.$LABEL$0,1,1
Disappointment apply to the First Two. I totally agree with "Barry" a new reviewer who nailed this on the head. The same Carol and Mike Brady actors from the first one film saves this from seeming for a lead pipe. The girl who plays Marcia is perfect, Jan ok, but the other children are genuinely different. The actor who plays Greg acts and looks more like Peter. pete and Bobby simply share no resemblance to the previous characters and have few cameos because of it. me thought the first part of the movie was confused and strained. Better plots are available. Some of the original series plots are brought forth, but never really captitalized on, except for the "slumber party" which was well done. This attempts to be as funny and comedic as the first two films, but fall short in depth and cleverness. Fans will want to see it...but take my advice and rent.$LABEL$0,1,1
A Cute Little Inspirational Movie. they do totally agree that its about time somebody made a movie about marching band. these these cheesy teen movie about high school football stars drive me sane. There was some good stuff in it.... while I didn't feel it was all completely realistic, that didn't necessarily take anything away from the movie. so I must say, if you found this movie to be the least bit interesting or entertaining, you should definitely check out Drum Corps International (DCI). If your not into paying 98 bucks for the finals dvd, PBS is broadcasting a show about finals in most states right now, and it should be in the rest by thanksgiving. That is some incredible stuff that anyone can enjoy if you take the time to find it.$LABEL$1,1,0
didn't last. they have many Kitchenaid products. I've loved every one of them and had no problems. back when we went to buy a new coffee maker i insisted on this one to use my kitchen, even though my husband thought it was too expensive. me talked him in to it by saying kitchenaid is forever and we won't going to buy another one of these for many awhile to come. He finally agreed. this worked great for about ten years and then i got an error3 message on the computer screen of the pot. I turned it off and on like the manual said to do. then i got a new error message, error2. according to the manual that meant the computer was shot in the coffee pot. I couldn't believe it. I was very disappointed. and my husband is now doing the "i told you so"! :($LABEL$0,1,1

better product. against advice the FIRST battery tender I purchased was from a local place and the reviews were not so great but being impatient I bought it and paid the price of not buying the best. 2 months later the product stopped working and another dead battery. Even when it did work, the car sounded like it wasn't getting fully juiced on start. So i finally ordered the Del-Tran Plus, hooked up to a dead car to see what the hype was about. The next day the car fired right up and sounded like a brand new car, not a 10 year old garage kept ride. I have been nothing but impressed and would highly recommend it.$LABEL$1,1,0
Come see?. I'm a real Bond fan. seen every one ever made and have all of them in my collection. I like Brosnan and the Bond Babes. But, not but. This movie just seemed right. The bad guys were really bad but not very believable. The special effects were special but not that special. An ice hotel? Dueling super cars? Trans-morphic DNA cloning? Bond films caught? cause me a break. Never happen. the producers and filmmakers seem to be losing the magic formula and trying to make up for it with flash and glitz.

loved it!!. We bought this gate a few weeks ago because I am 9 months pregnant and have a large chocolate lab that I do not want going into the baby room. However, I did not want the door to be shut all the time either. So we got this gate because I wanted something I could easily get in and out of without the hassle. This gate is terrible!! It was really easy to install and it looks great as well because of the clear sidings, it doesn't take away from the room at all. I also have a 2 1/2 year old stepdaughter who has not managed to get in or out of the gate, even with a little push. So I am fully confident that this gate will do the trick. I highly recommend.I only gave four stars because we haven't had the baby yet, but I do not anticipate it getting worse...only better!$LABEL$1,1,0
Do so Buy This Version of Metropolis. This is a great movie that Hollywood Classics has done the dis-service of putting out in their collection of DVD's. Sadly, this was my first time seeing the film from beginning to end, and I couldn't do it. The transfer is from a tape (a poor one, at that), the sound is garbled, and is too painful to watch with the lousy video quality. somehow, Criterion will do it right. Until then, do NOT purchase this version for anything but a drink coaster.$LABEL$0,1,1

Lucy: daddy Funny Episodes. These episodes are sooooo funny. You will not enjoy these.The first Lucy is actually funny. In "Lucy is Envious," Lucy's wealthy school mate, cynthia Hardcourt, is arrives in town. Lucy lies about that she gives a lot to charity and drops herself in a jam. She has to waste 500 dollars! She is hired to work as martians from outer space. They re paid 500 dollars, but Ricky and Fred pose as martians as well to scare Lucy and Ethel. The second episode, "Lucy Tells the Truth," is when Ricky makes a bet that Lucy cannot tell the absolute truth for 24 hours. Lucy is forced to not fib and makes it, barely, after Ricky gives in.Get these episodes. They are worthy of five stars.$LABEL$1,1,0
Problematic, funny subject. Stylistically this film was interesting. HOWEVER. This film is seriously difficult in its portrayal of a trans woman. I didn't even buy that Veronica was trans. Her identity seemed based around clothing and surgery as opposed to an actual gender identity. One reviewer talks about this being an accurate portrayal of a trans woman or representative of the trans experience? As someone who is trans and has many trans* friends, I have to strongly disagree. This film manages to hit every unrealistic stereotype about trans women. I wonder if anyone involved in the making of this film was even queer.$LABEL$0,1,1
I've quite had luck with Sony products.... There's little I can read about the 818LP because my set...broke down after roughly one months of use.Other than that, I think that in terms of sound, they're worth the deal but for a price just a bit higher you can get the super spark Plug earbuds which outperform the Sony 818LP in ALL ASPECTS. The foam covers are not only easy to use on, they fall off in an instant, mine lasted one week and one has gone missing, making the other one useless as there is no spare set included.Generally, I'm very disappointed with these earbuds, I expected more from Sony...MUCH MORE, but - just because of their sound - I give them 2 stars...$LABEL$0,1,1
be honest.. I bought this Wii Wireless Sensor Bar because my cat chewed through the wire on the sensor bar that came with the Wii. This one runs on batteries, but at least there isn't a wire for the cat to chew. There is a timer you can set so the bar doesn't stay on and using up the batteries when you're not using it. One night my husband played the Wii before bed and after we'd turned out the lights and gone to sleep the alarm on the sensor bar went off - it was loud enough to wake us up and the Wii is in a different floor of the house than our bedroom. So turn that off when you're done if you don't want the alarm going off.$LABEL$1,1,0

Good Plot ly Written. Roby has an interesting plot line, although it leans toward the predictable and sometimes turns preachy. Still, it's a good story with a logical plot and a significant message. Mrs. Roby has the potential to be a terrific writer, but she needs to develop her craft to reach beyond the amateur technique, sentence construction, and punctuation errors that plague her novel and distract from her story. Her natural ability provides a good outline, but her lack of knowledge in the art of telling a good story well proves to be a crippling flaw. In an interview with Mrs. Roby, she proudly said she had never attended a writing course or worked with a writing group. Investing herself in such opportunities for critique would polish her natural ability and challenge her to strive for excellence and craftsmanship. With the odds she's beaten already, what is there to fear from an opportunity to sharpen her skills?$LABEL$0,1,1

Good sound, outstanding build quality. I've been a Fender fan but recently purchased a Les Paul Studio Deluxe and love it. I like the shorter scale and wanted a less expensive guitar to haul around. I thought this was a great deal - an American made Gibson for $500. But the build quality is so low I'm considering a return. The fret edges are sharp, and the pickups aren't even installed properly. They're wrapped in shoddy electrical tape and just kind of stuck in there. They move around a lot. It sounds OK, but the pickup selector seems very cheap too, and I'm worried it won't last. I don't mind the cosmetics much - stripped down to bare bones. But it looks like it's just thrown together with absolutely no concern for quality. It's the poorest assembly I've seen on any guitar at any price - except maybe those $100 kits you see in music stores. Not recommended. Try an Epiphone maybe.$LABEL$0,1,1
okay Car Seat, but very hard to tighten!!. I am really unhappy with this car seat and my 2 year old loves it as well!! I need this car seat in store. I went in with another car seat in mind, but after talking to the sales man, who is a car seat inspector, he recommended this car seat to me. He said that this car seat is the only car seat that he recommends buying (at least the ones in store) that were a car seat/booster combo. This one was the only one that had the EPS (the stuff found in bike helmets). He said that it could be life saving in a side inpact accident.The only problem that I have with this car seat is that it is very hard to tighten. I pull the strap with all of my might and it feels like it is not going anywhere. It takes a while for me to tighten the straps everytime he gets in the car seat.If the straps were easier to tighten, then I would give it 5 stars!$LABEL$1,1,0

A true reason why they were on sale. Bought these the day after Thanksgiving sale on Amazon for a great price of 30 dollars in comparison to the original price of over 130 dollars. Got headphones and was not impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. extremely low bass and as it is noise cancelling, it also acts as a mini-speaker since it protects so loudly when off the ears. Also that 7 days, the right phone stopped working and I had to send off to Sony Service Center to get fixed. The good thing is that that was a very fast turnaround. Final thought, dont purchase if you are a true audiophile as you will be disappointed, even at the discounted price of 30 dollars. I have had 10 headphones I was happier with.$LABEL$0,1,1

Fairly Good, plus Includes Factual errors. I am only doing the pediatric section so far, but have had factual errors. For example, question 155 in the pediatric s: An infectious process that could cause meningitis would have which sign? You have to choose between headache and stiff neck, but either one of these could indicate meningitis. Consider question 205, which suggests that lymphocytic thyroiditis is temporary. hence, only the subacute form is temporary, but they left out the word "subacute" -- otherwise it would be chronic, Hashimoto's disease.Another problem with the book is that the pages come out easily, with only slight pressure.But most of these NCLEX books do contain a lot of factual errors. I feel like they should hire me as an editor; the so-called editors for most of these books must be whiskey drinkers.It's a decent book, compared to the others. Not the best, but in the mid-range. I would buy it again, but double-check the answers to make sure they're correct.$LABEL$0,1,1
Plain, Simple, Boring. this book is packed with information. Information that is mainly useful. I usually spend 60 pages a day reading about wine, but myself always love having to read 10 pages a day from this book. i is repeated over and over again. There is no pronunciation guide, so if you create an unusual word that you do not like how to say, you'll feel like your losing ground by not having it right. The the main maps of tasmania and New Zealand are somewhat decent, but the maps that they give for each region, for each chapter or section, are so detailed that there is no way you can reference where about they are in that specific region. Meaning they zoomed into roads, not cities (unlike French and Italian Wines for Dummies). To cut to the chase, the only positive thing I could come up with about this book, is that it is a rather large book and it would look good in your wine book shelf to impress friends. :)$LABEL$0,1,1
not good. When I started reading this book I thought it was going to be another epic tale but it turned out to be pretty decent. I like the way that Flewelling draws her world and the history behind it. Some of the characters such as Nysander and Alec are a lot predictable but I have hopes that the characters will develop through the trilogy.Flewelling kept dropping hits about Seregil's past and we just want to learn more about it, doesn't exactly work for me, but it did this time.All in all a good and fun read.$LABEL$1,1,0
