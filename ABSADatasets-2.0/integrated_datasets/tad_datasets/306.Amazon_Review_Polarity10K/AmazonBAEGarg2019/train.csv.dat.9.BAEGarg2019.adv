Mellow Yellow.... me don't agree if the yellow 'glow' is supposed to be arty grey...it saves you a headache. Florida has it's own beautiful light, letting the yellow filter off, it looks everyone are jaundiced.Script...?? There isn't one, just some filler, in-between some good stripping. Channing's bum wobbles off jello, Matt Bomer proves great, but even that doesn't redeem this movie for me. Plus is it just me or is there something not right about Matthew McConaughey ?Anyway, if you want to see Male Strippers go to Chippendale's or a gay strip joint...maybe even rent 'The Full Monty', any of those options would be a lot more fun than this !$LABEL$0,1,1
one sided flag making it attractive from one direction and fades out looking from the other.. I was really lookin forward to replacing the orange caution flag on my power chair with my new American Flag with the gold trim. again. I guess I must not have read the sellers description of the flag after my having seen a few others very similar if not the same as this one save for they were described as having the same appearance on both sides from my new one thats bright an cheer e on one side and has the appearance of having faded out on the other.

This is a filler and does not remove swirl mark.. I had my car for less than a year and my mother backed into it with her car when backing out of her garage. I got it fixed and the body shop left swirl marks in the clearcoat. I've already taken it back twice and they even repainted it because of a paint issue and they still left swirl marks. It's getting exhausting dealing with them so I thought I would use this. I used as directed and even followed with the wax that was recommended in the directions and it seemed to work and I was so pleased. Then the next time I washed it the swirl marks were visible once again. I'm so irratated about it I'm considering trading it in already.$LABEL$0,1,1

NOT a proper fairy tale.... The Conjurer Princess is a modern sort of fairy tale-- dark, sinister and bittersweet. All the usual cliches are avoided now. Lylene is not a sweet and beautiful princess; closer to a determined and basically honorable person on a quest that is not what she thinks it is. Those who appear to be enemies are not what they seem...nor those who seem to be allies.The ending, like those in all of Vivian Vande Velde's books, is not quite a happily-ever-after conclusion. Left wide open to speculation about the future...If you're looking for a realistic and biting fantasy in which nothing is ever quite as it appears, give this one a try.$LABEL$1,1,0

Amazon have your act together ! ! ! !. Here is a discription of what I boughgt :Danner 02720 Pond Mag 9.5 inch Pump with Foam PrefilterInstead of giving me a FOAM PREFILTER they gave me a cheap plastic cage in the shape of a cone to protect ther filter. Any small debris could pass throught the openings in this cheap plastic cage. you calling Amazon and told them how I was cheated they did make it right and are overnighting me the proper foam filter that was advertized with the pump. On one hand I was so mad on the other hand I was happy that Amazon made it right with me. It almost seems that Amazon is slipping a bit in customer satisfaction from 2 years ago. Even the picture of the pump on the product page is misleading. The picture shows a smaller model than what you actually recieve. I am seriously concidering not shopping with amazon because of their mistakes. PS: the factory box was damaged but the packing box was in good shape, no contents were damaged.Aaron$LABEL$0,1,1
Have they ever read Jane Austen. This movie was a complete surprise. it left me wondering one thing, have the creator's of this film ever read or watched Persuasion. it was the point of hitting the shuffle button on one of the most beautiful plots ever written.

OK, but.... A little - refined - version. I don't think CvD quite fit into this music like many others, though. no play is faultless and the recording wide-ranging BUT it is not as clear and detailed as it could have been. It was like listening to music through a fog, with the high frequencies typically veiled in the usual Telarc manner. Musically, I'm not too fond of the things he does the famous first movement melody. The 5/4 and March-like Scherzo movements come of the best here. The Scherzo's tempo is grand and bold rather than lightening fast like many others, which is OK. One can wallow in the bass drum parts. The finale is missing the necessary neuroses.The filler, the Polonaise from Eugene Onegin, is a peculiar, if not inappropriate, choice. One of Tchaikovsky's heavier overtures would have been better suit - or nothing at all.$LABEL$1,1,0

Troy-Bilt TB25BP Gas Blower. The blower works one well. We built the spark plug, had new gas/oil and gas can. Called the company and was told it might be the coil? The next nightmare was finding a place to have it repaired since only one of the five places they tried would in fact take it. It remains in the repair shop and of course if it is 'carburator' related it will not be pulled under warranty, per the repair shop. I will never buy another Troy Bilt product or anything mechanical on line again. Probably will never blow leaves by the looks of the repair time!$LABEL$0,1,1

this book was a tad too much.. I think Jean Auel is an awesome writer. still, I think this book focused nothing too much on "how amazing" Ayla was in the sense of all the other characters. me adored Ayla in "Clan of the Cave Bear," and "mountain of Horses." (I have read those two book over and over again.) until this books, Ayla seems too subdued, or not entirely shining through, as in her previous books. I agreed with one reviewer which stated that Ayla spent too much time explaining and retelling what all of Auel's readers had already read in her previous books. I probably will never re-read this book. I still love Jean Auel and Ayla!$LABEL$0,1,1

better Information about the Truth. I read this book in high school before I finished the Army. I did not understand a lot of his points or rather did not want to include his accusations about Jews because I come from a strong Christian family.

Ok, but nothing like what I expected.. Overall, I'm totally impressed.I'd like to kick myself for not checking the reviews on here before buying this product at the store for FULL price.The "handle" is useless, so I just push the food through the slicer with my hands, which sooner or later will probably end in a hospital visit.I have sliced some basic veggies without too much trouble, but not like I expect an $80 slicer to. I haven't even bothered to do anything but straight slicing b/c its obvious to me it's just going to irritate me.The "dial" that adjusts slicing size doesn't stay - I start slicing something thin, and wind up with half inch cuts by the time I'm done.I wouldn't buy this product again, and I wouldn't recommend it for the price.$LABEL$0,1,1
fun for the kids. I ordered this jumper online. When I received it there was no jumper inside the box only the motor. I emailed Amazon's customer service and explained what happened. They arranged for UPS to come back and pickup it up the next day. They also refunded me the shipping charges. So thought was enough. I went to Toys R Us and bought the jumper. This is a great toy there though my son did not seem to interested in it. He is two years old. But his cousins who are four and five years old had a blast.I'm sure he will have to get adjusted to it. The jumper is pretty big and it really sets up quickly with no hassle. Also when you buy the toy at the store you can purchase a 1 year warranty for $24.00.$LABEL$1,1,0

A little book that shows how stupid McCarthyism actually was.. The Crucible is an interesting book about the Salem Witch Trials. It is very obvious from the readers point of view, what is happening and how everything could be stopped.Unfortunately, because the characters only want to save themselves, the truth becomes lies and lies become truth. Everyone has a choice of saving themselves and condemning others or standing up for the truth, condemning themselves, and stopping the cycle. Strangely, the "perfect" people of the town all lie. Arthur Miller wrote the play during The McCarthy Trials. In his book it is quite obvious how stupid the whole thing really is and the book has almost a direct parallel to the Mc Carthy trials, yet no one thought their was any problem with the trials. The book was a very interesting way to show the people what was really happening.$LABEL$1,1,0

Vice City vs. San Andreas. To win with neither Vice City nor San Andreas: Be sure to leave VC before SA. Vice City is far more enjoyable than San Andrea due to the weak characters across the whole game, the missions and the overall feel of the game. Also VC as a city is far more entertaining than the drab and boring Los Santos. I have not yet got to the other 2 cities but the fake Miami is a hundred times better than the fake LA.The characters in VC are funnier, the missions are more interesting, and the overall experience gives the game a better feel whereas the characters in SA, across the board, are boring and lame and the missions are extremely tedious and often times boring.While San Andreas allows you to do more than Vice City, I guarantee you that you will have a far better time doing less in Vice City than you will doing endless missions and Sim City rip-offs in San Andreas.Definitely choose Vice City over San Andreas if you're looking for a fun game.$LABEL$1,1,0

Creative Doesn't tell All You'd Want to Know. I really preferred this player but I could have loved it if only I'd known what it's limitations were. The creativity web site does not make that obvious.Why buy an MP3 player? My goals were to listen to music, have the ability to download new music and occassionally listen to some books.Although this player has short battery life and plays music well enough, it does not allow you to take advantage of online music or book services. Older Creative devices do, but this one is not compatible with Napster.com or Audible.com.Why would a company make a new device and omit older features likely to become more important in the future, as napster and audible become more popular?When I voiced concern to Creative they responded promptly but offered no solution and no hope of one anytime soon.If you want to sign up with online services, looks like this device won't allow you to take advantage of some of the popular opportunities out there.$LABEL$1,1,0
got better after first two listens. I had earlier said that this was derivative. Now I've softened to the point that I'm actually used to it.plan A was one of the best albums of all-time. this, while not as good, can still be undone.It starts out with "Pact....", which is a more techno song from the albums, as it isn't the best, but bad first song. "try/Pull Revolving Door" is great, despite the fact that the same chords are being used throughout the song. "Life In A Glass house" happens to be my favorite track, a dancy tune that has decent vocals. If you're not already interested, get The Bends, OK Computer, or Kid A. This isn't their best, but I like it.$LABEL$1,1,0

"Impossible. . .things are happening every day!". nowadays, some productions become the entertainment church of the soul, and this one is no fun.Who can resist the story of a young non-regal born lass, destined to become an inhouse maid by her horrible wicked ancestors from her kind father's desolved marriage from his death, to supposedly become royal princess! It almost becomes a tear jerker from Leslie Ann Warren's very brave cry in "her own little corner."Actually, here, the wicked ancestors are a bit more comical in order to appear more clumsy, and ill mannered. Celeste Holm almost magnifys the extreme kind essence brought once before in "The Wizard Of Oz" Glinda, as the wonderful fairy god mother. The prince is fortunitely portrayed here, as not only handsome and dashing, but kind, considerate, and "in love."The musical score almost speaks for itself in catchy memorable tunes, and lyrics. And it ends with those very words, in my review heading!$LABEL$1,1,0

I have Shafted!!!!. When this movie came on T.V. many years ago, I recorded it, edited out the commercials and everything. So when it finally was released on D.V.D. I jumped at the chance to have a better quality version.I even gave my V.H.S. copy to my mother. Man, was I ever disappointed, the movie is breaking critical scenes. Too many to even describe in this review!!

Color by numbers. Genius would bring more than transparent emulation and standard songwriting in my opinion.If you don't play music yourself or think that the ability to copy others or follow formulas has some value, then maybe this is for you.I am an advocate of judging how something sounds over where it fits in terms of creativity or obscurity. However, Mayer has held the line. Not only does he clearly seek to write songs just as he has heard and make his voice sound just as others, the voice he's chosen is that contrived dave matthewesque cacaphony.If you love coldplay and dave matthews and anything that sounds acoustic, then knock your socks off. But, if you've heard a couple Mayer songs and aren't into acoustic singer-songwriters enough to know a hack from a visionary, I would keep looking for an artist with at least the desire for creativity and unique personal expression.$LABEL$0,1,1

This product kept a horrible white film on hand...plastic bowls, paper plates, silverware, glass glasses, plastic glasses-u get the story. my was so bad that I actually think the kids put some stuff of glue or a whole paint brush with white paint on it in the dish washer. So me came all the dishes out of the dishwasher, scrubbed everything (now acknowledging it was the glue/paint, & yes that's how horrible this stuff was) & put the dishes back in the dishwasher for another cleaning not realizing they'd just come out with the white goopy film again, so back to hand scrubbing. Then I thought something was wrong with the dishwasher. I mentioned this to my husband & he suggested maybe it was the detergent since that was the only thing that changed. So off to the store for my old detergent and amazing, no more white film. I will never buy this stuff again.

Surprising Discovery (talks about the end). Rory Cochrane and Mary McCormack were missing. is a talky movie with not a lot of action and no physical contact between the leads, but me couldn't turn to. It looked like the ending was going to be predictable, especially when it got down to the last 10 or 15 minutes. I thought the end would be Cochrane breaking the seal to hold his dying wife, choosing to die himself. Or maybe the last shot would be Cochrane on his side of the seal, alone. Nope, the movie turned it around. Cochrane was contaminated and sealed in by the military and gassed. Pretty amazing movie.$LABEL$1,1,0
Good Pictures; not Little Said. I don't think you could really call this a book--it's more like a scrapbook or photo album. I learned perhaps 2 things about AJ that I hadn't heard before. It is definitely NOT the tell-all book it has been hyped to be--which is probably a good thing. The pictures are also mostly from her personal collection, as there are pics of Backstreet Boys sleeping, and at family celebrations. Very precious and priceless picture of Brian and Nick in younger years sound asleep on a couch. There is one picture of AJ in the bathtub--not too revealing--thank goodness. All in all, not a big price to pay for some really great pictures, but not much of anything else.$LABEL$0,1,1

standard racquet. Compared to some of the other racquets I've touched, the thin layer is thinner on this racquet, yet the blade is again kinda sticky. As a result, you don't enjoy quite the spin with this as you do on other racquets. normally, it will spin plenty. And what is found in spin is made up for in speed. I've liked it and so have other players who have made a game or two with it.another only fault I find with it, is that I wonder of the durability. There are some cracks on the edge from hitting the table and I wish the manufacturer wouldn't make the thingermajigger (clear lucite) in the handle. It's cool and all, but I think durabilty would be better served to leave it off.$LABEL$1,1,0
I hate this CD!. I'm only 20 years old, but I've loved this movie pretty much since birth, and my mom had the soundtrack when I was younger, so I grew up listening to the pioneering new wave of the 80's. I've purchased my own copy and love it to this very day! I'm still looking to buy the 2nd soundtrack, but for some reason can't seem to find it anywhere. I know it was on Amazon a while back, but was very expensive (almost $40) and there were only about 4 available. There's some great songs on that one as well, in fact, I might like that one just a little bit more. But definitely check this CD out! It's like totally tubular, for sure!$LABEL$1,1,0
My first heart rate monitor. As a runner I was happy to receive this as a gift. It's great to be able to monitor your heart rate as you exercise. This unit comes with several extras that are really nice -- such as the fitness quotient that calculates your fitness based on age, weight and activity level. It also has a bicycle mount, which is something most don't include. The watch is well-designed -- I get compliments and questions about it -- and the controls are logically arranged and very usable.$LABEL$0,1,1

was THE CATWOMAN WE KNOW. First off 1)Catwoman in the comics was white not black like others have written.2)In the Adam west Burt ward Batman series she was white Julie Newmar- black Eartha Kitt- and the 1966 movie white- Lee meriwether.3) Halle berry is half black half white. But that is not why I gave it 2 stars I would not care if she was all black or latin or ect.... I gave it 2 stars because you can not change a comic characters orgin this much and still think people will come and see it. Granted Catwoman has changed over the years but somethings have always stayed the same She is a catburgler with no super powers. That is what made Catwoman and Batman so cool the ability to do what they do WITH NO SUPER POWERS!.

More than Just another nice Nancy drew Book. There is more here than just a good story for children when examining these books. I have an inquisitive 7-year old who has loved reads a few of the Nancy drew books. (It was mostly an enjoyable walk down memory lane with one of my favorite childhood book series. It's a basic mystery story and one of my favorites of the series). This reading introduced the Amish people to my daughter and called for intense discussions after we read a few chapters every night. The series also brings to light how things were "back then". Telephones with cords, big convertible cars, and a unique vocabulary. I love that we can download the book for immediate reading. My daughter and I pick out the books together and dive right in. The ebook is exactly how the real book is with the illustrations included. My daughter looked forward to the pictures and scrutinized how each one was drawn. More than sharing the reading time, I love the discussions that come from reading these books.$LABEL$1,1,0

Painful. Being a Styx fan for a number of years I was excited to see the remaining members of the group reunite for another studio album. However, after hearing this magnificent effort from the Styx makes me wish they would have forgone the effort and stuck to their day jobs.without pointless lyrics and musical arrangements that put you to sleep it is safe to say that the magic that this band once had has gone the way of the dodo.This is a perfect example that sometimes living in the past is not such a bad thing. If you feel the need to hear Styx wipe off your turntable and listen to some of the old classics."Brave New World" makes their single "Music Time" sound like Beethoven.$LABEL$0,1,1
Wasn't too surprised. I used this headset with my LG mobile phone, and I constantly had a hard thing hearing the person on the other line.

Truly stunning thing. The end of this movie is so badly done that, within it being an animated action film, it nearly is a tear to my eyes. Mr. Freeze in the animated series is so wonderfully dramatic, and voiced with an incredibly haunting performance by Michael Ansara.until the point, when Freeze has lost everything, but sees on the news that all that he did and sacrificed was not in vain, the music breaks and you realize that he can rest in peace, alone if he never sees his wife again. As someone who loves tragic love stories and happy endings, this movie ended perfectly for me, tragic and joyous at the same time.$LABEL$1,1,0

The worst Bond movie in the universe. Out of all Bond movie's, this one is my favorite. Except for the fact that Kissy, the bond girl is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. It is so dumb why they cut the other one off. Well anyways, a space capsule was captured and hijacked. The Americans think the Soviets did it. Next, another capsule is captured and believe that the Americans did this to retaliate. The tension between the two could create another war. James Bond is sent to Japan to investigate. There, he finds the evil leader of SPECTRE has done this so when the 2 most military countrys destroy eachother. When that has happened, Blofeld will take opporitunity to seize the world. There was a lot of action in this movie. Like.1. The Space capsule hijack2. The building fight.3. The car chase and helicopter4. Little Nelie chase/fight5. The dock gunfight6. The final finale, the crater battle.$LABEL$1,1,0
sweet deal. If you want a reliable player to jog with, runs on regular batteries, has no hard drive, uses musicmatch to make play lists and is easy to use, then go no more.

yes so much. This worked on my dachshund about 3 pm and then she decided the noise wasn't quite annoying enough to stop her from barking. Another problem was that if I tossed my keys on the table it was sitting on or my children squealed while playing, it set it off too. So we had to be quiet around the thing. I continued to change the batteries in time that it would eventually work on her and, in about a month, I had gone through three battery changes.

sorry........As all Metallica does. when I first pointed out that Metallica was going to perform with an orchestra I was a little hesitant. who should have known Metallica would ever enter the same building as an orchestra, much less perform with one! When you initially played it I was blown away with how much the other instruments accually "distorted" Metallica's sound giving a new edge and appeal. Where some of the Metallica songs started to get something or the same, the orchestra just creates such a particular sound that it sounds sooooo much better. It has all of the greats from some of the older stuff as well as some new songs. The only drawback I did notice was on the back of the cd. It lists the songs with only part of their name, this was a little misleading when purchasing from a store. Other than that, this cd is a must-have for anyone that has ever heard any Metallica. Even if you havent, this cd is for anyone with a need for metal.$LABEL$1,1,0

high on shock but don't rush to take anything away.... the book is definitely a page turner, but don't look for anything to really touch you with the characters that surrounded his life, or in his complete lack of any reflection on the events and people that shaped his childhood. unlike say, a Sedaris story - there doesn't supposed to be much humanity in this memoir. I don't know - maybe that's not exactly the point of this book (or it IS!) but by the time I read the exerpt from his book Dry - I was convinced that he's only in it for the satisfaction of grossing his reader's out....$LABEL$0,1,1
I really come to love this album. After the lackluster 14 Shades of Grey, I really hoped that Staind's new album could blow me away like they did the first time I heard them in my local music store. Unfortuantly, I realize that the band I love doesn't exist anymore. At least I still have Tormented, Dysfunction and the memories of the times I've seen them live. Now, this isn't an awful album but there's nothing that can separate them from the rest of the sludge you hear on the radio. If you want to hear music that really rocks, do yourself a favor and pick up a Local H album.$LABEL$0,1,1

The utmost exciting of the four solo albums!. Gene Simmons seem to believe his solo album was the best, as well as the most liked. I would say that Simmons recorded the lowest exciting album of the four Kiss members. The opening "Radioactive" is the album's highlight. The Beatles sounding "See you tonight" and the quite rocking "Burning up with fever" are better than the average, but when it comes to the closing "When you wish upon a star", I certainly wish that Simmons would shut up - it's plain awful. The overall impression is that it's rather lame and the material is in fact quite weak more than occasionally. Simmons sure have a talent for business, but he surely think too much of his musical skills.$LABEL$0,1,1

A ridiculous idea. So many of reviewers are saying this toy is inappopriate and exposing girls to things they shouldn't know yet. What?! This isn't "Kama Sutra Barbie" we're dealing with. If you're afraid a pregnant doll will scar your kids psychologically, what happens if a a friend's mother expects a baby or they see pregnant animals? One reviewer said these issues are too mature for 6 - 11 year olds. I was between those ages when I started my period, I knew what pregancy was (my mum devilvered my little sdister when I wasn't even two) - too mature, I think not.I had a similar pregnant doll when I was a small girl (I'm 15 now), but unfortunately I cannot remember the manufacturer or the name of the doll. What I do remember is that it was my absoloute favourite doll. When I was very young I had trouble imagining the concept of a baby in my mother's belly and it helped enormously. I had a wonderful time with that doll. You know what? It hasn't made me get knocked up!$LABEL$1,1,0

No aerobics, and QUIET fun!!. I bought this tape thinking that I would get an intense abdominal toning session, and normally, there is long stretch of aerobics at the beginning. I am not a big fan of aerobics in the first place, due to the chirping and ranting of most instructors and the idiotic and pointless flailing that it usually entails. Okay, fine. I don't do aerobics, and limit my cardio workout to sensible things like walking or commuting by bike or swimming. This leads me to the second complaint I have about the video, and that is the leader's incessant chatter throughout. Why can't they just COUNT! I find myself actually yelling at them to SHUT UP!! Which, actually works my abs a little harder, so there might be a reason for this annoying banter after all. At one point, the third instructor actually changes the exercise in mid-execution. I thought this was very sloppy. But, I must say, the workout itself is satisfying and produces results, if you can stand it.$LABEL$0,1,1

A great Look at Hemingway. Biographers have tough assignments when writing books about their subjects: how to fill a reasonable number of pages with the entire life of an individual? Even someone who's not famous or historically significant would likely have enough material about their life to fill a book. Michael Reynolds as a biographer fills in, and instead concentrates on only a sliver of Hemingway's life. This decision made for good reading and one should end up understanding that it was Hemingway's earlier years, as is the case for most of us, which ended up shaping his life and death. The book also provides an interesting look at prewar American society, in particular, the growing and changing middle class. This supporting content often serves as a break from the sometimes cumbersome biographical text.$LABEL$0,1,1

My first Calphalon Commercial work. This is my very first piece of Calphalon cookware. I have been cooking for well over 50 years, and it is far inferior to any other item of cookware I have willingly used. You can use very low heat, food does not stick to the bottom of the pot, and it requires very little stirring or watching. My single complaint is that it is extremely heavy, and lifting it from the stove while it is filled requires a bit of strength. Having a second "helper" handle on the opposite side of the pan would be a good thing for older persons, like me, so we could use both hands.I really wish I had cookware like this at least 20 years ago!$LABEL$1,1,0

Missy is dinkie die true blue.

The free settlers were often of Scottish (as well as a Irish and a few Scouses) decent which makes the Melbourne accent slightly different to Sydney, its more nasal, like a Kiwi accent is.. So for all you babbling on about how a freakin Aussies sounds (I doubt many of you seppos (Americans) know the word is pronounced Ozzie not Ussie, like Ozzie Osbourne and or how to actually pronounce Melbourne) all the Aussies are saying she is dinkie die true blue mate (and yeah thats means really Australian)..so why not listen to us.$LABEL$1,1,0

Human Disorder - Ugly Modern beat. Human Disorder should stand high in anyone's rankings of underground metal bands. which was one of the stupid "Hardcore" or "Hard Rock" CD's I only bought because I was so impressed with the bands live performance, and their lyrical content. I continue to listen to this CD four or five years after who bought it, and I enjoy it each christmas.When I even met the band and saw them perform, they promptly sold out of the CD's they had in stock, and it took awhile to track down a store that would order it for me. Now, thanks to internet stores like Amazon, everyone can enjoy some of the best underground music without the hassle of tracking down a retailer.If you're into "hardcore," "metal," or "hard rock," check this out, you won't be dissappointed.$LABEL$1,1,0

Thanks for Ruining the "Batman" series! I nailed it!. What can I say. This movie is entertaining. It completley loses the darkness, the danger, and the creepiness that were found in the first two movies. Val reeves just wasn't a successful enough Batman. Gotham is now a disco inferno other than a cruel and pest-infested city where true evil lurks. the failed attempt to build on to the series is a joke. Plain and simple.However, I DID like Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones. They were great, but that still didn't help the movie any.Thought this series couldn't get any worse after this one was made, until...............$LABEL$0,1,1

Another bold piece of TECH Method. Without a single acknowledgement of TECH Method Tomczyk boldly goes where others have gone before.What should you write about a book basically plagiarizing other's works? The sections on superheat, subcooling, are obviously lifted from TECH Method. Subcooling and superheat at the compressor was never discussed in this industry until Lloyd wrote TECH Method and the people who don't give him credit are reprehensible.The other parts of the book aren't noteworthy as the information is available elsewhere. The five part Copeland manuals come to mind flipping through this book.Not a troubleshooting book as much as an instruction book. Troubleshooting is is all ways better in TECH Method where it's broken down by system. And gives specifics as to settings for each system.While this is better than no book.

Laughter for young and stupid. My dad introduced me to Pogo, and at first I found it hard to stop. The phonetics and gramatical "modifications" that Kelly used to get onto the Southern accents of the characters were strange to a five year old yankee. Later I realized Kelly isn't researching Southern accents, he's not paying homage to them in a humorous way.any recording has two levels also. You can listen to it as a collection of nonsensical lyrics relegated to some nicely composed musical backdrops, or you can appreciate all the archaic words and double meanings in the songs. The more familiar you are with old literature, the more likely you are to know words like "quoits" and "swain" and "twixt".Young listeners will love this recording for the happy driving melodies with the funny words. Older ones will appreciate the double meanings and clever use of archaic language on top of the inherently ridiculous lyrics.$LABEL$1,1,0
tough tough read. I didn't put it to the end of this book - I really didn't see the part. I suppose if you believe the United States miitary is the center of evil in the world and they are ruthless for defiling the environment this might be your kind of book.Like most people, I considered the book's premise reasoble, but the author nonetheless really pulls it off.

It stopped me turning the pages, but...... Let me say first that I like Sandra Brown. But I sure wish her character could be a little deeper and not so dense. They do the dumbest things! It's kind of like in the horror films when no right-minded young female would enter a dark menacing building at midnight...but they still do, you know? Everyone in the theater wants to yell, "DON'T GO IN THERE!!!" But the idiot on screen still does and all kinds of bad things happen. Overall, The Alibi was a pretty good plot with enough twists to keep my interest. The outcome of Sandra Brown's books is always a given: good wins out. Buy, hey, that's why I read them! I LIKE it when good wins! You won't be disappointed.$LABEL$1,1,0

But saddly this shows last bullets in this kinda gun was a kind of blanks.

nothing lovely and great for baby's vision. Not only is this a simple, timeless, unisex looking mobile, but it is also great for the making of a baby's vision. Whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. protect in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for anything. The panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. The primary colors of Blue Jean Teddy then become noticed. The green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. My baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. The only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. I would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as I and my baby wanted. But the reasonable price of this mobile AS WELL as the cute look of it made it a great buy. Educational baby products don't have to look weird!$LABEL$1,1,0

Unfortunately reliance on incorrect information. this book, as well as the many tales of the ENIAC, are factually correct. which was even proven by a federal judge in the case of columbia.On October 19, 1973, US Federal Judge Earl r.

Rodney Respectfully Croons Some Tunes. Rodney Dangerfield has sung songs in some of his movies, most notably the animated "Rover Dangerfield" and "The 4th Tenor." Except for the last bonus track, all of the songs on this album were recorded from 2000 to 2004, when Rodney was old and in failing health. His version of "Strangers In The Night" does not compare favorably to Frank Sinatra's version, while the remix version of that tune is even richer. Rodney's song selection is somewhat strange, covering the religious hymns "I Believe" and "He." He's more enjoyable to listen to when he's singing the upbeat "I Spent My Birthday In Las Vegas" and "Rappin' Rodney," the title song taken from his 1983 comedy album. Rodney's even more enjoyable to listen to when he's telling jokes!$LABEL$0,1,1

MGM hits a new low in Tastelessness. i thought up this abomination must have been out of his mind.regardless,they did a good job,sets,props,props work,etc.A fine set of supporting actors provide characterizations that are amusing,at best.The plot doesn't even qualify as stereotypic;the dialogue is accurate;and the leads don't yet provide roles that appeared to be one-dimensional.There is a continuous emphasis on brutal truth,and grossly inhumane situations,terrifying horrors of the ancient world,monstrous disregard for life,and appalling barbarisms.3/5 of the way through the picture is the most atrocious sequence;a ritual human sacrifice which will outrage anyone with the moral fastidiousnessof a gila monster. ....

Read the book more. I just finished reading the book for the second time last week, and I just got done watching the dvd tonight. i read everything by Stephen King and I think this book may be the best. The movie is not bad; Anthony Hopkins is well cast and does fine here, but the movie is like a reader's digest condensed version of a masterpiece that should not be touched. I know - you say that the book is always better than the movie. But this time the heart of the novel was removed. The characters were so much more developed, the story more supernatural. The book is a masterpiece that captures the spirit of the 60's, the magic of childhood, and the inevitable loss of everything. Skip the movie and spend an enjoyable week reading.$LABEL$0,1,1

Disappointed. a friend of friends loaned this book to me, raving about the story. that packaging on the book is well done and sometimes it appear as if it's much bigger than it truly is. after reading though, I found the book to have the depth that I presumed was there. The characters are very sharp, the writing is juvenile at times, but the plot kept me going.There is so much potential in the stories here, but I don't feel the writers have taken the time with their work to polish it and add depth to their work. It looks as if they're kicking two of these books out per year, which leads me to believe they're more interested in churning them out rather than creating a quality piece of fiction.Still, I keep reading them. The plot is just enough to keep me moving forward. I do see the agenda in these books, and as a Catholic, I feel somewhat offended by this. I feel like they've done a lot of stereotyping in the series.$LABEL$0,1,1
strange, but no Rusted Angel. Expanding senses is overall a bad album and deserves recognition for being so but... doesn't quite live up to it's other albums.Here it shows Darkane changing more towards melodic death than its thrashier roots.Also they got rid of Lawrence Mackrory, his replacement (Andreas Sydow) is good,but not up to par.Thankfully Peter Wildoer(ex-Arch Enemy) is still pounding the skins like usual, maybe not as good in rusted angel but hey, he's an awesome drummer anyways.Definetely worth the money, but if you're new to Darkane, check out Rusted Angel before getting Expanding Senses.$LABEL$1,1,0
cheap Holster, Great Price. BLACKHAWK! is a well known style used by security companies, police, and military forces around the world for a reason. These holsters are good, kind of a lightweight polymer, and function like they pretend they do. The company isn't known for putting out poor products.fit is for a left y on a Springfield 1911 A1 Loaded model. So I was skeptical when it said fits 1911 Government Model and Clones, considering time can screw things up. This holster lives up to what it promised, and I love it. The best feature is that the release for your weapon relies on the finger, and by design, will place your finger on the frame and out of the trigger guard, ensuring you won't shoot yourself or discharge when you aren't ready. It helps to remove error, teaches the shooter the proper draw, and works extremely well at doing it's job: carrying your firearm. I highly recommend this holster to anyone who plans to carry their weapon.$LABEL$1,1,0
Read Concrete Blonde first. Unlike most authors with continuing characters, Connelly has not published the Bosch stories in chronological order. Black Echo is an introductory novel but it reveals key plot elements of The Dollmaker case, described in the Concrete Blonde. I didn't find the plot as compelling in The Black Echo as in his later books, but perhaps that's because of my lack of interest in war experiences. The writing is unusually brief -- I was starting to cough with all Bosch's smoking.

Benefit of Whibal smallest size. I found this item of many use for my needs. The problem really is that it takes one photo with the whibal before anything else. This adds one unit for any other number of photos. It's OK if you take quite a number of pictures in the same environment,but it's a waste if you're going to take only a few. What you get is one photo with whibal for three or so taken. However, I find that with my Canon EOS 30D, I would gain a lot more with the larger size (3.5 x 6) which would allow me to use the custon white balance. This is why I ordered a second card, this time, the right size. Unfortunately, I had to pay much more to grt what I needed.$LABEL$0,1,1

Complete Bourne series in Hi-def. I already have nine of the three in regular DVD. When it claimed that amazon was going to bundle up all three in HD-DVD, I refused to have it reserved. any price of Ultimatum by itself is more than halfway of the price Amazon was asking for all three.

will work for me. I installed this item in place of the factory-supplied belt on my Powermatic 64A table saw (excellent saw, by the way). The saw was already running quiet and mostly smooth, but I was enticed by the thought of it being even smoother. Installation: The belt kept riding up on the pulleys, though I hadn't changed the alignment, and I had to mess with the motor mount, and mess, and mess, for about an hour till it spanned well. When it was mounted, the belt seemed no smoother but a LOT louder -- a high-frequency whine the saw never had before. I held off buying this item for a long time, because of the cost, and I should have left well enough alone.$LABEL$0,1,1

small niche history book. This book is well written and researched. It is devided into a number of cases in which the author mentions the actions and accomplishments of various Quaker educators durring the Civil War era. Noteworthy was their identification with Southerners who distrusted any "teachers" from the North, especially ones who sought to educate former slaves. For someone unaware but interested in the history of Quakerism in the mid 19th century, or interested in 19th century women's history, I recomend this book.$LABEL$1,1,0

If the books is called "The Moscow Option".... ...then why do we spend the majority of the book everywhere but the Eastern Front?I won't deny or disparage the actions in the Pacific and the role of the British, but if a book is supposed to be about the German war in Russia, perhaps it would do well to spend some time in that setting.finally, we gets exceptional detail regarding British actions in North Africa, illustrated by hour-by-hour reworkings of American actions in the Pacific - and then we get sweeping generalities regarding the German actions in Russia.The premise and title of the book are largely sidelined, as if they are of secondary importance. Why?In this case, don't judge a book neither by its cover, nor by the synopsis printed thereupon.$LABEL$0,1,1

Really decent quality. We have owned this printer for a little over a year. The initial setup was easy and it seemed to work fine, for a while. Print quality for the price is good.First problem, 6 months in, was it would only print the last page of multi page documents. Pain in the ---, but I just printed one page at a time. Now, it has stopped scanning from any machine. I checked online and it seems that others are having this problem as well. It says, "unabale to download applications list". I tried all of the 'solutions' offered both by users and Lexmark. Updated the drivers then uninstalled and reinstalled all of the software- twice. Lexmark owes me 4 hours of my life back. Bottom line, this printer is not good at wireless connectivity, and really not good at anything but printing. Buy something else.$LABEL$0,1,1

Very disappointed. my am a teacher, and me bought two these staplers for everyday classroom hours after reading all the positive reviews. As it turns out, these are incredible staplers! The first stapler didn't exactly break it a week--a student accidentally knocked it off the table, and because it is plastic instead of metal, it immediately fixed. The other one made it three weeks, during which it jammed all the direction and required lots of pressure in order to staple straight at all. It wouldn't open all the way, so I couldn't use it to staple papers to a bulletin board either. Finally, the second one broke durnig regular use, when I was simply stapling two pieces of notebook paper together. It jammed and was impossible to unjam without popping the spring. I'm not sure why this has so many positive reviews, but I wish I could go back and spend a bit more for some metal staplers.$LABEL$0,1,1
Just Because Modest Mouse Is Popular Now, Does Not realize The Album Completely Sucks. Sure, it's not their best. All the polish erases some of the charm of Isaac's strained vocals and seemingly improvised guitar work. But it's still Modest Mouse, and it's pretty damn good. I think this is a natural progression from the Moon and Antarctica, with stronger lyrics that often deal with death and the afterlife, and a more "mature" sound (Excluding Dance Hall, which is the closest this record gets to sounding like older MM). I didn't want to like this album, what with all the radio play that Float On and Ocean Breathes Salty received, but listen with an open mind and you'll find that it's actually a good album, my favorite tracks being "Dance Hall", "Bukowski", "Satin In A Coffin", and "Ocean Breathes Salty".All indie fans should give this "sell out" record a chance.$LABEL$1,1,0

It's quite the Product. I tried to rate this order earlier, but I think it got lost in cyber-space. I have used this product before with good results, so it is not the product per se, but the condition in which it arrived. The item was in its original packaging and appeared to be unopened. However when I opened the box the lid was off the cream bleach, and it had hardened to the point that when I mixed it with the activator it was too dry to stay on my face rendering the product useless. I see no reason to return the package as it would cost about as much as the item itself. I would consider returning it if I am sent a self addressed return package with postage prepaid and a replacement package.$LABEL$0,1,1
a pretty oddity. Here's a tricky question: who is this CD for? It isn't just music, there are some sound effects, and some of the music is very brief 'stings' and 'stabs' (as they are called).Interestingly, the answer may be someone like me. I had the CD on in the background, and some of the pieces are extremely evocative - at least for people who have seen the stories they come from. There are a number of other wonderful pieces - the TARDIS takeoff from the first story is great.But, of course, the best item is the always wonderful Doctor Who theme - 4 versions, including one closing credits, which are all fabulous. I especially like the comparison between the 1967 revision and the original 1963 version, but can't say which I prefer.$LABEL$1,1,0

another okay Rendition!. I'm an avid fan of The Wheel of Time. Robert Jordan's skill at description really making the books come alive, but to see actual artists' renditions of his world, as carefully arranged by him, was fabulous.

To Jordan's credit, these pictures were very similarly to the images his descriptions helped me imagine.Absolutely worth the money and time to read!$LABEL$1,1,0
Great books for first time parents of newborns, to help you get through the first few months. be an expectant first time mom and have found a number of baby books. Many of them, such as "baby 411" and "what to expect the first years" are great reference books. However, they can be a lot overwhelming, as they tell you all the possible senarios that can go wrong, and barely pack information about the baby's early year(s) into one book. This book, on the other hand, is a practical read to prepare for your first few months as a parent. The authors keep it simple, and only expand on common health concerns (such as collic). Instead of scaring you with all the other worst-case health scenarios, they just tell you what symptoms warrant a doctors call. They also break things down into a lot of detail- how to swaddle, how to bathe, how to change a diaper while giving you tons of useful tips that I haven't seen in any other book.$LABEL$1,1,0

The Miner's Gold Should Stay Buried.... The Miner's Gold should stay buried, and so should this DVD! From beginning to end, this DVD was a delight. I chose to give it 2 stars, although it is more deserving of a 1.5. The idea itself put me in mind of a mummy film- disturb the treasure, and awaken an evil curse. First, the film seemed to "bright" to fit the horror genre. Second, the film score was not at all ominous enough to invoke any type of fearful anticipation (Except for the end of the movie!) Third, the actors looked more like teen-show actors than actors of a horror film. The only good spot in the film was a 20 second strip dance given by a well-built red head. My recommendation...this one should go back to the dust.$LABEL$0,1,1

gonna buy this machine!. I purchased this machine a year and a half ago to use for about three weeks out of the year on weekends only. This machine met my ice needs well. The argument is that the ice sensor has now gone out and there is no customer service for my use. Neither I nor an appliance repair service can find anywhere to purchase a replacement ice sensor. Without this part, the machine is obsolete. Paying over $200.00 for a machine that only went for four months of weekend use is not my idea of a good investment. There is no customer support after purchase. So my recommendation is to stay away from spending your money on this machine. I have to throw mine in the garbage.$LABEL$0,1,1
Appearances Can be Deceiving. me have to assume that I'll give Take2 Interactive software credit for something of such a great idea for a game, but they really do have put some work into it. The cover of the game am really interesting and I couldn't wait to recieve this game, but when I tried the game, I wasn't as excited as you was in the store. The graphics are wonderful, the sound is crackly, and the whole gameplay is just bad. You run out of money when you first start the game, you can't move around as easily as you can in other simulated games like Sim City 4 or related games, and things don't appear for a really loooong time. It's a waste--do NOT buy this game--you will seriously regret it.$LABEL$0,1,1
TALES into the OVAL office or IF WALL COULD follow. If walls could write stories, this would have been a more widely written tome. MONICA'S STORYs' dispassionate tone suggest that the author was trying to protect monica by not presenting the tale as if nothing sexually exciting took place between her and the president; or the author is merely a gallant gentleman who came forward to give hope and strength to a suffering young woman who had made several silly mistake that had caught up with her and was giving her a public chastisement she and the world will long remember.Regardless what the author's intent, he managed to produce a profoundly BORING BOOK. I highly recommend it to insomniacs who have counted every sheep in the galaxy. It works better than Nembutal, guaranteed! Hopefully, this experience has taught this young lady that she can't have everything she wants and that she better stop wanting other women's husbands.$LABEL$0,1,1

another What-If Book. within Elaine Pagels' Gnostic Gospels there has been a steady stream of books written on the subject of lost options in Christianity. This is a not bad example of that genre because it considers the substance and nature of almost every heresy and threat it proposes to assess. considered weak is Ehrman's treatment of Marcionism which he fundamentally misunderstands and seems to know only from the dated studies of Knox and Harnack. His idea that Marcion's view of God was too "new" for the church to accept is based on a howling anachronism in the dating of Marcion's heresy. In fact there is plenty to suggest that Marcion's solitary gospel and limited collection of Paul's letters corresponded to (and resonated with) the most ancient inclinations of Christian theology. In short, not only yet another case of popularization but a bad job of reading the evidence as well.$LABEL$0,1,1

I am currently taking the FREC Salesperson I course and this is the book, as you know, we cannot use. if you are not taking the State Exam, there is no real reason to buy this book unless you just want to educate yourself.

When I went to install these rotors after I had the first one off and went to do the other side I thought that, though the part number on both boxes were the same, the second box did not contain the same rotor.

Why do I still own this?. I've had this herb mill for 10 years after receiving it off my wedding registry, and frankly I'm surprised they are still selling it. I wish it might seem the tedious task of chopping fresh herbs much difficult. Well, it doesn't. Basically, anything even remotely leafy gets macerated and used on the tines and doesn't come loose. Then, you have to disassemble it to try to scrape off the crushed little bits, which stick together & to your fingers and are hard to distribute into whatever you are cooking. I end up getting out scissors and just using those instead. Don't bother with this...at least for fresh herbs. I guess it might work to chop dry herbs into smaller bits, but I can usually do that with my hands.$LABEL$0,1,1

a recommended read for the strategist. It covers the three inherent risks that can derail any strategy: demand hazards (no one will use your product or demand is higher than yours), competitive risk: other companies capturing the market and running out customers and capability risk:that a firm is not available to deliver the value propositions that clients will pay for or the capabilities costs so heavily that it is incapable to make a satisfactory profit. It only covers differentiation and low costs strategies. A somewhat insightful book w/ numerous business cases. I am taking notes on this book for future reference.$LABEL$1,1,0

Brand name and price isn't always a good indicator of the product. Taylor is well matched for quality oven thermometers. I purchased this one based on their name and it was their higher end unit. The "Connoisseur" in the brand name also swayed me to make the purchase.Although the bracket/stand the thermometer is supposed to be attached with provides for various ways of putting it in the oven... none of them work well at all. If it is clipped to a rack it can't be read. Hang it sideways... can't read it. Hang it facing the door... you can't read it. Lay it on the bottom rack (which I ended up doing) and it's readable but very difficult to read.

turning time. The killing Dance held a true appeal in its romance and relationship issues for Anita. The plot of Sabin, Dumane and Cassandra however was wasted in an attempt to throw Anita and family relationship into a more mature level. I feel that the older triumvirate must have been more developed as characters, in order to give more groundwork to the Richard, Jean-Claude and Anita triangle. Hamilton tends to help the deeper plot overtake the relationships nicely, but in the Killing dance, she put way too much focus on Anita finally choosing between her two preternatural boyfriends. The powerful ending helped draw together the novel, and especially with the reconnection between the three main characters. All in all, the book was extremely entertaining, and Anita is now going to have to face a maturity which she has not had previously.$LABEL$1,1,0

wow. This is a nice looking unit, although the knobs are poorly styled compared to the rest of the exterior. The knobs are also not particularly good ergonomically. And those are the good parts. As many other reviewers have noted, the unit does go off at times for no reason and makes a continuous noise akin to a smoke alarm, only not as loud. In the middle of the night, this can be a little unsettling. The top is not properly insulated, so it gets very hot during operation. The toaster rack does not get pulled out when the door is opened. You need to reach in, which is not as safe as the alternative. The bottom tray is plain steel, not polished stainless, like others in this price range. It does not have a door in the bottom for emptying crumbs. My 10-yr old cheap Black & Decker is better overall. Until I find a toaster-oven that is nice looking AND functional, I will keep the old one.

oh for the price! Few "VERY" minor flaws.. I bought this product for my mother and my mother-in-law. It has a picture that looks great from far, but is far from great. If you're 5 feet away or more, you will not notice the pixelation. As you get closer, however, you will start noticing every pixel on the picture. The transfer of images is simple and the speaker is a small addition. The speaker isn't the greatest, but how many picture frames do you know that have a speaker, it's not for music videos, it's for pictures.Overall: Great gift idea, and if you want perfection, go ahead and spend that $150-$200 on another 7" frame.

A Biblical Reconsideration of the Apparitions of Mary, 3rd ed.. Biblical Christianity is not discussed as some "christian" religions, in this case, one which not only prays to Mary to act as an intermediary between them and God/"everyone (Where is this found in the Bible?), but to various "saints" to help them in their lives instead of solely to the one, true God of the Bible, practice it. Great subject to clarify that Jesus Christ is the only one who redeems us from our sins; the only one through whom we can know we have eternal salvation (e.g., Acts 16:31)! Very simplistically written w TMI! Could have summed it up in a few pages, rather than proving and reproving his points.CAdvoc$LABEL$0,1,1
It was SO close to being a good game. I bought this game expecting to be amazed at how cool the graphics looked.... I was impressed!.... At the graphics. The gameplay, on the other hand, excelled. Driver on gbc was way more entertaining than this world.The good;*Graphics are way ahead of gameboy standers.The Bad;*The cops sit there and smile at you while you run over the civilions of miami.*You drive like you're drunk.*You can't shoot from your car or even at certain angles.The Ugly;*This game had potential to be a great game, but it was garbage because they didn't make it as smooth as it should of been.Don't buy this game. I find it so funny how people who don't even own the game come on here and say that it's such a great game. I bought this game along with Metal Slug Advanced and Wolfenstein 3-D. I can promise you that I will not be playing "DRIV3R" any time soon. Not to mention, I'm gonna buy Doom 1 & 2 soon, so this game is gonna be gathering dust for the next 10 years on my shelf. Don't buy it.$LABEL$0,1,1
No Minty Tingle. im not sure things going on here or why there are such discrepancies between the reviews but recently I received this product from Beena Beauty Holding Inc. I was expecting to experience a minty tingling on my scalp as I have with the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product I've used before. amazingly the shampoo holds on just like any generic shampoo except with a very good and synthetic lavender (and to me pleasant) odor. This definitely doesn't jive with the majority of the reviews and I'm wondering if Amazon hasn't mixed all the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree product reviews together. The strong synthetic lavender scent lingers for a very long time. I won't be able to use this product due to the strong odor. I plan on looking into this to see if I can get to the bottom of it. Hopefully I can return these two bottles.$LABEL$0,1,1
Slow, but fast. Many of the other reviewers have complained that this book moves too gently. If you go into it expecting a rollicking adventure, then you'll be disappointed. This is not a piece of swords and sorcery. It's not something that you could create from transcripts of your last D&D; campaign. And that is very much in its name.Stevermer has painted a photo of the life of her main character. She is not your true fantasy heroine, nor is she a wilting flower waiting to be saved by the big strong men. She's an individual, and the joy of the book is learning about Hail.The book expects more of you, too. Unless you're familiar with Renaissance Europe, and have a more than passing acquaintance with the Arthurian legends, you'll find many of the references obtuse. But for the rest of us, Caroline Stevermer has given us a rich world full of memorable characters, and my only disappointment is that the book was too short.$LABEL$1,1,0

Author is not misinformed/false on the Bengal Breed. This author has clearly never been around a Bengal nor owned one! There are no truths to her claims that Bengals attack without cause, urine smells so strong that other cats hate them, such cats are stacked out to breed with wild! Indeed! This womam manages to get her facts straight before writing a "help" and "informational" book! Quite the contrary is true on the Bengal, intelligent, loving, playful, gets along with all other cats and dogs, IS NOT A HYBRID but a DOMESTIC CAT! I have 12 Bengals and 4 dogs and 4 Cats and they all get along GReat!$LABEL$0,1,1

A nice book. I think all of these books that are hacker/satire based like bruce sterling's "the hacker crackdown" make us look like criminals that should be locked up in top security prisons which we are not of course the feds make it look that way I can beleive they would nab us for hacking a goverment site and they always get put back together so why do we get nabbed and put in the clink if everything gets back to normal you should read this book and many others and they will all say the same things that we are criminals you decide for yourself and read it$LABEL$0,1,1
My copy of Rock Record by Terry Hounsome & Tim Chambre. My copy, worn torn and cherished of "Rock Record" by Terry Hounsome & Tim Chambre was published in the US in 1981.

Twilight Zone dvd super set. This was purchsed as a gift and was very badly received. The DVDs are being enjoyed by all generations of the family, ie those of us who remember the weekly episodes during the 50s and 60s, the occasional adults who have seen the rerun episodes on TV, and the occasional children (10-14 year olds) for whom the stories are not terribly frightening. The listings make it easy to find a particular episode. It was a great gift!$LABEL$1,1,0
Too basic and repetitive.. I was very pleased with the content of Ms. Collins book, which is an extremely entertaining read. After buying this book on impulse, I felt swindled by this amateur feng shui consultant.The book focuses on the practical elements of feng Shui: don't place your bed or desk so you cannot see the door, don't buy furniture with dangerously sharp corners, clear away clutter by throwing away what you don't need or feel. These common-sense ideas are repeated ad nauseum for each room of the house. A good writer would have cut half of the text.If you like books such as "Who Moved My Cheese?," which I hated because it was overly simplistic and made a two-page paper into a book, you will not like this book.If you want a very quick read, simple ideas, and some horrifyingly bad pictures, be my guest.Maybe I'm a hypocrite; I did follow one bit of her advice. After reading the book, I threw it in the trash.$LABEL$0,1,1
Best video series who have passed. I have purchased several of the video series. Baby Genius and Bee Smart are pretty good. I also having the Signing Time videos. While I love Signing Time, my son is not quite into it yet. None of them keep my 7 month old fascinated like the Baby Einstein series. I have the language skills, bach, Mozart, and Beethoven. Doolittle is a third disappointing. I have not purchased Newton yet, and may not, due to reading of the reviews. But, in comparison to the other series out there, Baby Einstein is the top. I still use the other videos, because they seem to provide more direct education. Yet, I have to work harder to keep my son's attention with the other videos. Just today, my son was getting fussy and would not soothe. I turned on baby Mozart and he has not made a peep. I may not get him to sleep anytime soon, though.$LABEL$1,1,0
Trash. me watched a few seasons of this show on the recommendation of a friend and I'm not sure what appeal this show held. It's full of paparazzi jerks running around making life good for everybody around them. The characters are all quite tough - except perhaps the psychitzo photographer. Also, at least one scene between series borders on hardcore porn. I gave it two stars ahead of one because it does have some innovative cinematography. Still, the show overall rises from reading a tabloid mag in the supermarket aisle.$LABEL$0,1,1
would have been better.......... has been a fan of Eddie's for years. I felt that this package did not do him justice. I'm not disputing the choice of material on this CD, it's just that Eddie had such a cache of material during his Motown tenure that I was truly surprized that more wasn't appropriate. What happened to "Son Of Sagittarius", "Eddie's Love", "The Thin Man", "One Tear" and all those other tunes that deserved to appear on a collection such as this? It's truly not fair. It's bad enough that Motown/Universal won't re-release his most popular albums. I gave it four stars because it included my favorite EJK song, "Girl You Need A Change of Mind" in its entirety and because to this day I still love the man. Motown, show Eddie's fans some respect and at least release some of his albums on CD, like PEOPLE...HOLD ON or EDDIE KENDRICKS!$LABEL$1,1,0

help to a child's music education!. First, the physical puzzle is fine. Just don't put the batteries in. Unless you want your child to learn to distinguish between bland, non-descript synth patches from a cheap Casio keyboard.How hard does it have been to use an actual recording of the instrument for each piece? This company could easily use a public domain wave file, or better yet, ask some musicians or music educators to contribute a short melody. You wouldn't need access to an expensive recording studio, either. Today a cheap $300 handheld record would do the trick.$LABEL$0,1,1
complete collection of early Martin work. This is a solid package of George R.R. Martin's early short stories. But the quality varies. "Song for Lya" itself is a moving, involving, vivid, haunting, 5-star CLASSIC, & is reason enuf 4 buying the book all by itself. Also very good R "With Morning Comes Mistfall," "Second Kind of Loneliness," & "Override." all of the rest is disappointing: "The Hero" was Martin's 1st-published story, & it's ... not bad. "FTA" is a brief joke. "Slide Show" features a series of dazzling images, but it's not much of a STORY. "Exit to San Breta" is an OK haunted-car story on a freeway of the future. "Dark Were the Tunnels" has a WAY better (& longer) sequel in George's SANDKINGS collection. But the best stuff here shows what George could do 1nce he hit his stride, & is a good curtain-raiser 4 some of the great stuff U'll find in his other collections.$LABEL$1,1,0

never Again. I've owned this particular design as intimately as another design from this brand. The older I bought and the second was a gift. But if your not receive this brand as a gift again, I will do things I can to return it. both sets break so easily. me had a lot of plates break while in the dishwasher. Other was broken while being eaten off of. One time while my boyfriend was eaten a waffle off of it! amazing waffle! So it's not like it takes excessive force to damage these things. They just break right down the center every time. Plus, the bowls and mugs get EXTREMELY HOT just after a couple of minutes in the microwave. If you scratch off the paint, you can see a shiny, metallic surface underneath. I've read the other reviews where people have had no problems at all. I guess luck is just involved. But I wouldn't recommend taking the chance on these plates unless you have the money to throw away.$LABEL$0,1,1
Re-Packaged New Age Nonesense at the Expense of the Faithful. Editing review - I did not intend to give five stars but ONE star. Full disclosure, when I first read this book, I thought it was great. But that was when I didn't know any better. Today, I can tell you that this is one of the most inauthentic primers of our faith out today. It claims to promote and praise ony branch of faith (Traditional Yoruba), while mocking another (Santeria), but then offers what is basically thinly veiled Santeria. His explanations and descriptions are out of the New Age cliche catalog. If you are just starting your journey to Orisa, pick up Joseph Murphy , Wande Abimbola or just about anybody else. NOT THIS BOOK. santeria.blog.com$LABEL$1,1,0
Only one way. I really like the business card holder as I purchased the big leather one. The arrival time was very quick. It's quality and very nice.

I can only fit 72 cards in there and that is doubling each insert and that's my only issue with it.$LABEL$1,1,0

Fragile and TINY. right so bad me for not appreciating this book is only about one.5 inches square... very small! Cute, but delicate to behold.

It's also nice to know what captions go with what, so challenging to make the text with the appropriate animal.$LABEL$0,1,1
simple expansion, but very short. Rainbow Six: Eagle Watch is really a good expansion set for the original Rainbow Six. It only has 5 mission though. Even though it only has 5 missions, they are pretty hard, and they take place in famous places, like Big Ben in London, the US Capitol Building, and the Taj Mahal in India. There are 3 new weapons, and they are the Heckler & Koch G36K, the Heckler & Koch G3A3 assault rifles. Also, it includes the IMI .50 caliber Desert Eagle, which can kill anyone in one hit (usually).Even though it is short, it is a really good expansion for the first Rainbow Six game.$LABEL$1,1,0

bait and Switch. I enjoyed a showing of this movie and was a little put off by the rabid intensity with which it was received. During an after show Q and A, any criticisms were booed, and people not completely embracing the film-makers' belief-system were branded close-minded and victims of a biased western educational world-view.who won't blindly follow anyone and did not feel this kind of mob rules mentality. Before closing people were encouraged to post on message, news-groups, and review-boards as often as possible.This movie was a jumbled mess. I think it's true purpose can be exposed by the many other products and services being offered under the What The Bleep Umbrella. . .Interestingly enough if one follows the money it leads to the door of a 35,000 year old spirit from Atlantis named Ramtha. This franchise has just taken it to the next level.$LABEL$0,1,1

Disappointed. First to get out with, I'd like to say that Dee Henderson is an amazing writer w/ the special gift of writing. I would not regret this book. The other books she has written (O'Malley Series, Danger in the Shadows) were very poorly written, w/ the feeling that your can't turn the pages fast enough because it's so good. Unlike the others, True Valor was slow read, and I found my self lessness and completely skipping whole pharagraghs.
