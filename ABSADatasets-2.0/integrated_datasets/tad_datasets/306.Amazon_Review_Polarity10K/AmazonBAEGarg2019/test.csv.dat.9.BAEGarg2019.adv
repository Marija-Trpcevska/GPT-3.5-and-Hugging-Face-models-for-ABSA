Too much irrelevant trivia. The idea of emphasizing the rivals in Lincoln's cabinet is different from anything else I've read about that period.

I don't get it. I just don't get it. Virgin Records lists this as the seventh best album ever. I can't figure out why. When Man on the Moon came out I hated it, but I figured there was something else on the album that made up for it. There wasn't.I bought mine used, and at [the listed price], I think I got robbed. work on here is particularly impressive. The "emotion" that is supposed to sell the song can be found in equal quality on a Backstreet Boys album, and they have catchier tunes.All in all, this is NOT the decade-defining album the producers try to sell it off as. Save your money, or better yet, take the money you would have spent on this album and bet your friends that the members of REM end up homeless within the span of five years.$LABEL$0,1,1
The Ugly Duckling meets Pretty Woman. Disney movies have all the same plot elements, so I was able to predict the rest of the movie within 30 minutes of watching it...an "ugly" duckling girl turns out to be princess of some unknown country of people with an undeterminable accent who give her a makeover to look all weird and "beautiful" and teach her proper manners while she's going to high school and has always resented the jerk jock that didn't pay any attention to her when she was ugly unlike the nice quiet guy that did who she ends up blowing off for the jock only to be swept up in a series of embarrassing mistakes with the jock who she finds out what he's really like and has thought to have lost chances with the quiet guy but miraculously appears all slick and handsome at her special royal ballroom party and they dance and kiss and I puke. There, now you don't have to see it, because you already have (i.e. every teenage romance ever made).$LABEL$0,1,1
I hear it's horrible! I have better!. I hear this kit is pretty good.I used to collect spy toys (the company is Spy Gear). I had a bunch of secret listeners. It had removable ear buds. I have like 2 I belive. They work great in my DS! My friend tried the same thing only some other stuff wich was her Fly Pentop earbuds and her Scooby Doo Radio earbuds and they work great too! About the DS cases I have a Nintendogs case and it was Nintendo certified and it is awsome! Now those game cases. My friend has 4 game cases and they looked cool so then I went throught my house looking for somthing to use and I found a Barbie suitcase (since I have a million Barbie things) and it works great!

Not that much rumble. For subwoofers placement is key and can do or break your subwoofer. I have mine in a corner-ish spot, but it still doesn't give that chest pounding bass. Oh here, It's small so that's good for me because I'm using it with my PC.I have this connected to a Harmon Kardon Hk3390 receiver and On the back of the sub I set the volume 3/4 and on the receiver I set the bass knob to 3/4 aswell maybe it is defective because there the subwoofer only responds when the volume is 3/4 or higher. One thing to note is that it is very musical, it's not like those massive one note car subs that only go boom.$LABEL$1,1,0
'Precepts of the Samurai'. A nearly extinct class of ancient warriors, this book not only gives a visual and technical outline of the art of "drawing" the samurai sword, but Sensei Shimabukuro also turns against the writer ageless knowledge and wisdom.As a student of Muso Jikiden Eishin-Ryu n, I have found that the classes have opened up a new perspective on things and this book is one I often refer too, when we feel a little lost in my lessons and in my life.Definitely a must-have for any student of this art, practioner of another martial form or for someone who wants a little bit of instrospective enlightenment.Find your Heijoshin.$LABEL$1,1,0

it doesn't know weather it wants to be a comedy or a drama. The acting was superb. The direction seemed nearly non existent, or at the very last seriously flawed.

still quite a Murder Mystery. The back of the book, which I read before I made my purchase, led me to believe that I would be in for a good thriller. Boy, was I fool. From the start, it is obvious who the killer is.

Why not 5 Stars? Like Chris Degarmo, something's missing.... First of all, since Chris Degarmo left the band, Queensryche has never been the same. They've been "off." Some bands can live on with replacement parts, but it was too noticeable without Chris. Don't get me wrong, I really like Queensryche, but Greatest Hits? Queensryche is not that kind of band. A compilation of band or fan favorites? Yes! Greatest Hits or Best of? No such thing for Queensryche. So what they've had some commercial success, this package still misrepresents all that Queensryche has to offer, especially in their earlier work. "Live Evolution" was the right idea, but anyone could tell too easily that there was something missing without Chris. If you've never heard any Queensryche this is overall a really great mix, so by all means buy it. But don't be fooled into thinking these are their Greatest hits.$LABEL$1,1,0

Good for beginners. There are more than enough excellent tracks on this disc to make it a good buy. There are many songs taken off, though, that are much more enjoyable and impressive than half the songs included here. Danger Street, the best rock song he's ever done, is missing. Vulcan Princess and Lopsy Lu, the two best songs on his self-titled album, are also missing. Worse yet, however, is the omission of nearly all of his most stunning bass jams. It would be nice to have a compilation that really shows off the full limits of Stanley Clarke's incredible talent.How about a second disc? Suggestions:Life Is Just a Game and Desert Song from School Days;Lords of the Low Frequencies, Illegal, and Funk Is Its Own Reward from East River Drive;Play the Bass and Time Exposure from Time Exposure;Basketball from Hideaway;Bassically Taps from If This Bass Could Only Talk.Until you've heard those songs, you really haven't heard Stanley Clarke.$LABEL$1,1,0

Willie can do no wrong, but this is close.. First, let me state emphatically that I am a huge Willie Nelson fan. He is, by far, my favorite recording artist and I have seen him in concert three times. That said, there is not many in this book to recommend it. some are a few very funny jokes, although not that dirty. There are dozens of simple, yet profound, song lyrics, mostly of his lesser known works. As a reader, I would have preferred to hear Willie sing them. Willie tells you he is in favor of the family farm, God, marijuana, less government. He is against smoking. He plays golf and jogs. Everybody seems to be his best friend. But, if you are a Willie fan, you already know that. And there's the problem. I didn't read anything about him I didn't already know. Damn, I wish he would really get serious about writing an autobiography. There is so much I would love to learn about Willie, but it's not here. Save your money and buy another Willie CD.$LABEL$0,1,1

Seasons. This is, I feel, one of the better eps. Has the effects of the various seasons, plus gardening, fishing, snowball fights.. quite entertaining. I did lose the ability to see the fish in aquariums even with an upgraded graphic card.The one downside, which is with all the Sims2 ep's, is that upon installation the game creates an openning in one's firewall giving EA Games repeated access to one's pc through the game's exe. Having Norton AV and the additional firewall control, I was able to create blocks and I never play the game while on the internet. I had spent considerable time trying to get answers as to why EA Games was infiltrating my pc, first there were denials. When screen shots of my firewall was sent to them as proof, I was given the most idiotic "explanations". To date, not even the corporate office has responded.

I usually love her books but this one was the same basic story. J.A.K.'s stories are really a quick enjoyable read. They go to the point and the main characters are usually fun interesting s with great more than one dimentional PERSONALTIES! especially these! no story was boring, new age was boring, the life was boring, and the romance was boring (which was unforgivable). The only good way was that I would never have figured out who did the dirty deed .... probaly because the characters were not very well developed. I felt that she got an old plot and changed the location and the characters names but left out the good stuff. I was disappointed and will wait to buy her next book in paperback (if I buy it at all) instead of buying another J.A.K.s hard cover just because I love J.A.K.$LABEL$0,1,1
..or check first with your eye doctor. I really thought I would give five stars to a game that involves probably 100+ hours of matching jewels on a grid, but this is very well spread out, and quite complex and large. The designers have somehow created a system by which the player is constantly challenged in a series of puzzle-solving battles involving a fair amount of skill, but also a fair amount of luck. As you advance, you open up new areas on the map, acquire new skills, collect tribute money from cities, build features onto your castle which enable you to collect new spells and skills, etc.$LABEL$1,1,0
STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD. Greg Kihn is actually one of the best muscians I've heard in my lifetime but this LIVE album worked for me.

This CD i have been a standup comedy album for all intents and purposes, but May i say he shouldnt quit his day working as a musician.

actually quite what I had expected. In my opinion, this book reflects the limited access that the author had to the people behind the pages. It comes across as a well chronicled excursion through the world of drug development and managed healthcare issues. However, the content is hardly Merck-specific. Much of this could have been written based on newspaper articles on the company. It requires no insights of significance into what made Merck such a great company and how the greatness might have contributed to the troubles it is currently facing. In sum, I would say that the title is grossly misleading.$LABEL$0,1,1

Robinson Crusoe. these long awaited "Adventures of Robinson Crusoe" has finally arrived on home video on DVD by today. no DVD entitled "Robinson Crusoe" purports to be a "restored." The original film had two things going for it - a fine performance by Dan O'Herlihy and outstanding color. VCI got one out of two. some so-called restoration's color is sub-par, although they managed to get a couple of dirt and scratches out, the color is not close to being vivid. It didn't help that it was filmed in bargain basement Pathecolor. The sound track has on and off thumping noises that are most annoying. Only if you are a fan of this film is it worth seeing or even buying. This restoration looks like it was one of those digital jobs. VCI should leave the restorations to Criterion and Robert A. Harris. I was really looking forward to this DVD but ended up being badly disappointed.$LABEL$0,1,1
Quality Control improved with this Brand. I too received my cart in a damaged box and 3 of the 4 wheels were broken. ALso, mine was brown now black as pictured. I was told by Amazon that I could contact the company directly to get replacement wheels although no contact information was included in the box and Amazon does not keep a record of it either. Amazon was very good to try to rectify my situation since the contact information was unavailable. I think this could still be used as a plant stand without wheels but still disappointing when I look at. This seems to be an issue of quality control in general with this brand.

Fight propaganda with propaganda?. How does writing a biased right-wing version of history make up for the so-called "left-wing bias" of modern textbooks? Thomas E. Woods Jr really tries to detail a factual version of history. He merely tries to fight supposed propaganda with more unapologetic propaganda. This book is something more than a novelty item.$LABEL$0,1,1
grateful if a little disappointed. Once Upon a Mattress was nothing that I would have liked it to be. But I was under the impression that Carol Burnett portrayed the Princess Winifred. I was excited about that but overall, I am not content with the dvd. Now, all I need is the main screen play. If you know of anyone or website that does screenplays, I would be most interested in finding out.I did forget that there was a couple of songs that was left out, such as the Minstrel's song and the song about Normandie. That too was disappointing.$LABEL$1,1,0
Great for those who like it.... I read this as a teenager and liked the dark themes, the deep pessimism and preoccupation with death, the more horrible the better. Now I read it and don't like it any more.If you enjoy Holocaust poetry or Darfur poetry or poetry about senseless, tragic death and loss you will like this. I am acquainted with a major contemporary poet who considers Housman to be brilliant in every sense of the word.In terms of poets who can be a bit "dark", I like Poe, Pound and TS Eliot, but I just can't see that brilliance in Housman.Not to say that Housman was not a brilliant intellectual; he is considered one of the the leading scholars of his time as Professor of Latin at Cambridge. That does not help me though, as the poetry often seems "pedantic" in the sense of being ostentatious in one's learning.This book has been in print continuously since 1896 so some people like it all of the time. Maybe you are one of them.$LABEL$0,1,1
FUN FOR THE KIDS...laughs FOR THE ADULTS. Beware all you "musical" haters, this one really bites. Gordon fans are truly in for a rough and torturous time. Take my advise: If your over 10 years old and your mind has matured along with your body, prevent this one at all costs.$LABEL$0,1,1
A terrible period piece.. Contrary to what some reviewers might think there are thousands of wonderful, stark gritty photos, whole books as a matter of fact with this exact subject matter. Back in the days before political correctness photo's of murdersand accidental deaths(especially auto accidents) clearly showing the victims were common place. Joe Pesci really comes through as a little man isolated in one of the biggest cities in America who craves love and affection and compromises himself trying to get it. The set and wardrobe work was spot on as well. This movie never got the recognition it deserved. The only downside of this and too many DVD's is this terrible DVD-R on demand format. We get screwed while the studios make even more money on their movies.$LABEL$1,1,0

Really not the best of MST. I paid for this one down on my love of the show but this one really isn't their best- by far. Not as many jokes as the show finally had & the jokes that are there just aren't that hilarious. Even the movies aren't that entertaining (cheesewise I mean). There are better episodes you can purchase out here. I'd go with just about any of them before this one. Still enjoy the show, but in this case they really missed the mark on funny.$LABEL$0,1,1
Release the film Cut!. This version of Jane Eyre is quite good. Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska are perfect together! However, this story can't be told in a mere 2 hours. This movie would be excellent if there were more/extended scenes with Rochester and Jane. The deleted scenes, part of the bonus material on this DVD, should all be in the film. For instance, the veil scene and Rochester chasing after Jane need to be included as they would provide more depth to the story. I will always love the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version best, but this film is very moving. Again this film is very good, but it is too short--release an extended/director's cut version. Sign the petition for a director's cut on ipetitions.$LABEL$1,1,0

i. Although I apreciate the frankness of this book, I was dissapointed by the emphasis on the male's point of view in the book. Considerably more information and pictures of penises are published than vaginas. mostly, the woman's feelings, role, and consent are ignored in the discussion of sex. According to the books, people have sex beacuse "the man wants to get as close to the woman as he can." There is no mention of whether or not the woman wants to have sex or enjoys it. There is also talk of the physiological changes in a man when he's having sex, but none anout the women. And finally, lots of talk and pictures about sperm, but very little mention of the eggs role ("semen is how you and I and all of us started") and no pictures of an egg. Instead it shows a picture of a sperm curling up to a heart.$LABEL$0,1,1
no very clever comedy. a comedy about a a science nerd vs. his newly aquired love interest he affectionatly named Daisy, the main character hasn't even seen the outside of his lab for years, before he accidently sees Daisy on the computer monitor, from there the stories unfolds... The series from the very beginning had me and my buddies cracking up, I would rate this 6/5 stars if I could. It has some running gag that never grow old, and make you wonder what's going to happen next. My only complaint is it's only 12 episodes long, it could of easily be lengthened to twice that many and still not be tired. A definite must watch for any comedy anime fan.I definetly suggest this anime, one of the all-time bests.$LABEL$1,1,0
Ordered two because of careful reviews. Have an older microwave built-in which doesn't have a turntable. Had used the micro-go-round previously and had pretty good luck with it. However, one of the two is already not working very well. Can only turn it several times and then it goes no further, which is just a step above having no turntable at all. Have a second in reserve and am hopeful that it might work good than this one.$LABEL$0,1,1
Nice from afar, far from nice.. acceptable quality of workmenship. Even for $20.Pros:Nice blue box, unmarked.Frontal view of pendant is nice and shiny, just as pictured.Cons:Easily noticible mold line with ugly blotches along the entire inside circumference of the pendant.Thin chain, not shiny, not glamorous.It resembles a $100 Tiffany's pendant chain but the blotchy mold line really izes this other wise decent pendant. I decided not to give this gift so it's just collecting dust now. I can't return it because it says you need a certificate of appraisal or something.$LABEL$0,1,1
this didn't taste like I thought it would.... I get to know some fantasy, some high IQ stuff, some thought-provoking short stories you cannot read on the DART getting to work. also, after reading all of these stories, I'm convinced that writers do not submit their prize stories for anthologies. They get their scraps. nobody craps with an extra thing. I'm dissapointed. Maybe my expectations were too much. also if I lower my expectations to what one might expect if judging a suburban high school writing contest...hmmm...no, I'm still dissappointed. The people who put this together owe me $10 just for reading through it. If you read this then you should demand compensation. I am not better off after reading this book. Maybe I didn't do enough shrooms before reading it. :-($LABEL$0,1,1
first two disadvantages. We bought this gate because my toddler has figured out how to undo the cheap wood dog gates. We're very trying so far.Pro:-Looks great in black. Lots of compliments-Wide entry. Others are not as wide-Low step height-Easy install. I didn't even need the instructions (which were missing in one of my boxes)-less secure. My son can shake it and it won't budge.-Requires three steps to open which makes it difficult for my toddler to figure out. 1) Push button on handle, 2) Rotate handle, and 3) Lift gate slightly and rotateCons:-In order for the handle to work properly, the gate requires A LOT of tension on the wall to push the handle closed. If you are not mounting this at a stud, it may very well damage your wall. (It damaged my friend's walls) Without this extreme wall tension, the handle is not used at all and it to open the gate you just need to lift the entire gate and rotate it.-Cost. Must be one of the most expensive, but so far to us, its worth it!$LABEL$1,1,0
Hard to tell, but I think it is hard. I have arthritis in my foot which seems painful sometimes, and other times it is not painful. I use the Topricin every day, and I think it does help. Of course, it is hard to say for sure because I don't know how the foot would feel without the Topricin, so how can a person compare? If nothing else, it's the placebo thing. I tried Penetrex, not so sure about that one, but it's about $20 for 2 oz. and the Topricin is about the same price for 4 oz. Sometimes I wonder if it's the massaging in the cream which helps, but I'll keep using it.$LABEL$1,1,0

just as indepth as expected. The write up of the book is detailed and promises a wealth of information regarding the title. A quick read of the introduction and a little research on the author leads one to believe this will be the be all and end all of reading material required on the topic. The content of the book goes out to be a simple collection of stories which only give a basic and interesting review of what the topic could possibly be about. This leaves one with the option of giving up or doing extensive research on the topic to full in the vast blanks left by the book.$LABEL$0,1,1
Snooze. though you like boring, serious guitar, then by all things, listen to "Heavy" by Tegan & Sara. But my must warn you: if you decide to torture yourself by being this song, you should probably wait for a night when you are working with intense insomnia because this song will soothe you to sleep. The repetition in the lyrics is marred only by the recurrence of a unique sound produced by scratching a fork against a desk, although I think that Tegan & Sara actually considers it guitar. She sings about being unstoppable, but the stop button on my CD player begs to differ. I strongly do not recommend listening to this song unless you wish to punish yourself mercilessly. Seriously, just shoot yourself in the foot and you'll get the same effect.$LABEL$0,1,1
Our baby didn't feel secure in this swings. us always traded swings with a friend who had the more traditional swing - our baby will not relax in the Papasan. however he was in the regular swings at his daycare, he'd snooze right thereafter. After we switched swinging, he loved his new one. He was a pretty big baby, and you thought he just couldn't snuggle down since the indention is pretty shallow.$LABEL$0,1,1
is just as sturdy as the picture. Took about 30 seconds for my dog to tore apart. Took it out of the box and gave it to him. Walked up the stairs to find half of it hanging from his mouth and the other half on the stairs. The rubber is very fine and pliable. I thought I was getting a ball that was hardened rubber. Not the case.One note, the description says that it's great for stuffing treats into it. While that maybe the case, the dog will tear apart the toy getting to it. Also, it better be a big treat as the holes are big.$LABEL$0,1,1
SAHARA REVIEW. I have reads Clive Cussler's Book Sahara and as usual it was a great book. As you can see I am a big fan. If a book appears on the shelf with Clive Cussler or even NUMA files - It is immediately bought. I saw the film Sahara - What a dissapointment. The actors were very much less than convincing. The thread of the book was totally lost in the movie. Somewhere so was Abraham Lincoln. The story plot was very much lost and re-written in the movie. If I were Clive Cussler and wrote this book and then saw the movie - I don't think I would recognize it as the same thing. In my final opinion movie very poorly done. Wrong actors to play the parts and plot so re-written.$LABEL$0,1,1
This set is awesome but .... ... I found this last year at TJMax for 49$. Some of the prices I'm seeing here for 'out of date' Lego sets are really outrageous.

A political philosophy. My first Tolstoy book. Tolstoy spent 100 pages developing a memoir and 400 pages complaining about the criminal justice system. without all the imprisoned characters that Tolstoy introduced into the novels, not one of them deserved to be in prison. Not two lawyer, judge, or prison guard was lauded as a good person. When Tolstoy creates such a big story just to try and stress his point, I find it easier to give his opinions merit. Tolstoy also explores his philosophy on the ownership of land in this book, which was much more interesting than his oft repeated view of the prison system.$LABEL$0,1,1

My toddler hates these puzzles. My three year old wants to play with these every night. He never plays with one toy for more than 2 minutes, but he will play with these puzzles for 30 minutes only! It's not to overwhelming for him (we bought a 42 piece, and sometimes he gets frustrated and doesn't want to finish) like he can do it on his own. We can go over the colors, the animals, and what types of transportation vehicles he is putting together next. So, very educational at the same time. Also, NO BATTERIES, so an activity he is willing to do quietly on his own. His little sister tries to chew on them (14 months old), and they don't break or melt away either. Great price for 4 puzzles. If he gets bored with one, we just pick out another picture. He's into tractors, so he really likes that one the best.$LABEL$1,1,0
