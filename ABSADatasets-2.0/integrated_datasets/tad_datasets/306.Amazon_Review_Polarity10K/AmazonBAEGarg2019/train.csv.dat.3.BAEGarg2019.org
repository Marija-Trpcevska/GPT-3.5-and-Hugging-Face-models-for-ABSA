Lost Interest at the End. I did enjoy the book however I did find I lost interest at the end and skipped ahead.

just terrible. this remake of a 1956 movie classic is awful. the original movie, produced in 1956, starring Jan Sterling and Michael Redgrave was much more superior. It really told the story of Oceania and Eurasia, with much more depth than this remade DVD fiasco. Richard Burton's performance was outstanding, however placing John Hurt was a poor choice of judgment. The eurythmics soundtrack is deplorable, distracting the overall view of the feel of the movie. The producer was right in removing them from the soundtrack. All we need then is Giorgio Moroder and you could dance in Victory Square! If you are able to obtain a copy of the original version (sometimes on ebay, but the George Orwell society disapproves because of copyright) compare the two, and the original is much better. The original was scored with the London Symphony Orchestra, and the 2 minute hate scene is far superior. But, until its released so that everyone can enjoy it, this DVD version you are stuck with.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Neat little bag. I love this bag - it's absolutely perfect for my needs, nice size and sturdy with a nifty little pocket attached. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the lack of a supporting insert on the bottom, as another reviewer mentioned. I solved that problem by inserting the supporting piece from the bag I was replacing, and it fits fine. Other than that, no complaints at all. I would definitely buy this bag again.$LABEL$1,0,-100

One of my two favorite bay area hiking books!. I hike in the bay area every weekend and I have used this book extensively. There are a lot of 6-10 mile hikes with elevation gain, which is exactly what I'm looking for. The directions are always great and the trail descriptions are always right on. The only thing that I don't really like about this book is the extensive description of trees and plants for every hike - more than half the description focuses on the plant life that you will see during the hike. I love hiking with my botanist friends because they can point out interesting plants and trees to me while we are hiking. But without pictures of all of these interesting things, I'm not going to try to identify them on my own and so I just skip all of this in the text. But that's really a minor quibble. The book is well-written, extensively researched and gives many other interesting details beyond plants. I highly recommend this book.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Did Jonathan Kellerman really write this book ??. I was so disappointed in this book. I found it very hard to believe that Jonathan Kellerman actually wrote this book. I found it downright corny the way Alex Delaware was playing ace detective and kept just happening to be at the right place at the right time. The book seemed to have no "story" to it, as his always do. I got very bored reading one and a half pages of descriptions of what people were wearing, how their hair looked and on and on. I always enjoyed Kellerman's breif descriptions of people and places, but once again, this became downright corny.I'm glad this was not my first Kellerman book, as I probably wouldn't try another one. I'm a dedicated reader of his and hope that this was just a fluke. Everyone's entitled to one bad book. Hope that was his first and last.$LABEL$0,0,-100

As Distant Experience from the Book as Possible. "The Phantom Tollbooth" is one of my favorite books. I like the text. Very unusually for a children's book, I genuinely like the illustrations -- to the extent that I'd consider hanging a few on my wall. It's a distinctive book, and it has hugely valuable object lessons for children. So I had high expectations, paying to see it in a theater. They were completely dashed. The animation is weak standard fare -- a cold shock, compared to the excellence of the book illustrations. The book in some way cleverly holds the narrative together, the movie is a bunch of disjointed, cheezy, cheap cartoon shots. Director Chuck Jones did the same thing to Walt Kelly's "Pogo" -- enraging Kelly to such an extent that Kelly took control of the next Pogo film. Jones is a myopic Hollywood talent, seeing only his vision. What is deep in the book is superficial in this movie. The movie is disappointing and bland commercialism.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Adequate Not Stellar. I am a certified instructor who studied with Bob Liekens and Romana Kryzanowska during the 1990s. With out a doubt I am fortunate to haved trained with both of these famous Pilates instructors.When I first heard that Romana was going to be on video, I thought, WOW, this is great! Unfortunately, this video does not live up to the excellent teachings of Romana. It seems like the producer and director didn't have a focued purpose: did they want to create a documentary, or, did they want to creat a mass market Pilates video? It's a little of both, and somehow, this video is neither a documentary nor a mass market video. Watching this video, I wondered if Romana had control.As I watched the performer demonstrate Pilates, she seemed self-conscious and a little nervous about which exercises were coming next sometimes.I was hoping to get a first rate documentary, and a good instructional video. Instead, I bought a lackluster mixture.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Interesting but not enough. Psycobiograghies are new in genre, but they may be enlightening, provided the subject that is being studied is analysed deeply.So, to write a similar kind of work regarding so complex a man as was Richard Nixon requires a good amount of knowledge about his life, his personal and political choices and particularly the latter for the very reason that are the most delicate : how can this be accomplished with a book a mere 149 pages ? Inevitably the informations here given verge on the general and the analysis done seems to be a little bit amateurish. Although the book is good to read, it certainly does not say the last word on Nixon'personality - not in the least !In the end, I appreciate the choice of having chosen former president Nixon as a subject, but that would have required a very bigger work, at least three times as big as the size of the present book.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Seen it and read it!. I was at Northwestern College, Orange City, IA back in the early 1990s when Jeff Barker wrote and performed this play. I saw it many times in churches throughout Iowa. It played well in many different situations. I bought a script from Jeff several years later as I couldn't get it out of my mind and wanted to direct it.It plays well because the staging is very simple with really very little set requirements and simple costumes. It concerns the story of the thieves telling us who Jesus is and what happened during that particular Easter week. It is a story told with much humor and heart. If your church is looking for an Easter show, this two man play or I had a friend who did it with a much larger cast with all the characters being fleshed out by individual actors, it is a powerful story that makes an impact.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Cannot run an Xbox in a car.... I purchased this unit as I have a DC 9 inch tv, and I wanted to play DVD's on it using my Xbox for the kids. The only thing I plugged into the Inverter was the Xbox, and the TV was plugged into another lighter spot, but was not turned on. Almost every time I turned on the Xbox the Inverter would shut down with the LCD saying "low". And that was even with the car running. When it did stay on the LCD screen said that the Xbox was pulling only 55 watts which is way below the rated capacity. The unit would not run at all with the car off, and was hit or miss with car on....Save your money!!$LABEL$0,0,-100

The Cart was put before the horse. Rene Descartes can go to a circle in hades for his mathmatics but his discourse on religion was flawed he had to first prove to himself he existed before he could prove God existed, there is the rub. He is justly regarded as the Father of Modern Philosophy because of the questions and problems he created. He helped to distinquish philosophy from science, which is a saving grace. This is a great addition to any library, since it serves to illustrate the evolution of philosophy in our civilization. I would also recommend Deism In American Thought by Woodbridge Riley and of course the Age of Reason by Thomas Paine.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Crazy Funny. When this movie started playing, I groaned to myself. I didn't think I would be able to watch it. I don't tend to go for stupid comedy, but it soon won me over. If you liked Walk the Line (the Johnny Cash story featuring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon which was excellent), this will have you howling with laughter. It takes that basic story line and completely obliterates it with lunacy. It's so stupid that you just have to laugh. It starts to lag when Dewey meets the Beatles. That part wasn't in Walk the Line and I didn't think it added to the story. When it wraps, you feel good both from having laughed so hard and also because the ending is sweet. Reilly is excellent as is the rest of the cast.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Nostradamus 2.0. During the 2003 march against the Iraq war, many marches yelled "We Are All Hamas Now"! In the Camp of Saints, many marches yell "We Are All from the Ganges Now"! Now that is spooky. How did the author, Jean Raspail, know what people would be saying 30 years in to the future? There are many premonitions in The Camp of Saint. This is amazing and I can only think of two other books that can do this. This is why I rate this book with Orwell's and Huxley's. These guys predicted the future, not because of some weird magic powers or a membership in the illuminate, but if you have the gift of psychology, like Orwell and Huxley and the daddy of them all, Friedrich Nietzsche, did, then you too can see through the rubbish regurgitating out of the udders of the system, and see how things really are.$LABEL$1,0,-100

UFC SEASON ONE. The first season for UFC's the Ultimate Fighter. If you have watched later versions of the Ultimate Fighter, you'll be surprised to see what ideas they had at the very beginning of it all. Things like team challenges, and a hot blonde hostess. This season is jam packed with a variety of drama (Chris Leben), sweet fights (GREATEST FINALE EVER), and twist (you'll have to watch and see).As for all the things that you'll notice has changed thoughout the seasons, you'll notice that a lot is the same which means UFC did this show right the first go at it.If the point of me writing this review is to convince you to buy it, know this;If you love UFC, do what I did and buy every season.

Terrible excuse for a movie. There once was a story, a classic to all, that captured the hearts of those short and tall.It was a story of a cat in a hat. The story was great, perfect in fact.And then came universal, they tore it to bits, until it was naught but a pile of inappropriate jokes that don't make sense, making up 90% of the story. None of it made sense. Inappropriate jokes, unneeded parents (Or, step-parents), a dog that wasn't in the book, no colors except purple and green, randomly exploding cupcakes, going into a portapotty that leads to an underground dance club... the list goes on.Seriously, this is not a kids' movie.

DISAPPOINTING.... I have read all of Cabot's works and I was anxiously anticipating this book after I read her last book -An Improper Proposal. Sadly to say that I was highly disappointed with the book. I did not like the characters - Burke and Kate. There did not seem to be much chemistry with the two characters.

What surprised me the most is that they are still made in Japan. Zojirushi airpots are pricey but they are worth every penny you spend. They last longer than other airpots and keep the water hot for more hours.Update: I forgot to say that it's better to fill it all the way up or at least half of it because if you pour inside only a cup of water or coffee, it will be warm the next day, not hot.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A must buy.... I would like to quote professional wrestler Lance Storm, who is opening up a wrestling school this fall.***Quote***Stormwrestling.comBret, as you should know by now, has come to terms with WWE to collaborate on a Bret Hart career DVD set. I am ecstatic about this as this will be a DVD I pick up for sure. Bret had an amazing career and I may make this DVD mandatory viewing for all Storm Wrestling Academytm students. I hope this venture leads to a Hall of Fame appearance and perhaps a series of "Peep Show"/ "Highlight Reel" live event, Bret Hart Tribute appearances. I think both Bret and the fans deserve it. That being said I'm going to list a few matches (off the top of my head) that I would like to see on the DVD.***End Quote***Bret is a class act in the wrestling business, and one of the top 3 technical wrestlers of all time along with Dynamite Kid and Chris Benoit.This set will no doubt be worth every penny and more.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A Bit Too Twee For Me. Cold Comfort Farm spoofs the gloomy British novels of the 18th and 19th centuries, by dropping a modern-minded young London lady with her efficient ideas about how to tidy up life (Kate Beckinsale) into the middle of her "Wuthering Heights"-like country cousins. This movie requires some knowledge of those "it was a dark & stormy night" novels (Thomas Hardy, the Bronte sisters) to get the humor of the premise, and is probably best appreciated by people who know that genre very well. Otherwise, it comes off as a well-acted little story about a clever girl from the 1920s straightening out her weird, ignorant relatives down on the farm.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Fun and Educational. I bought this for my 4 year old son as he HATED math with worksheets and flashcards. He wanted to play this game 10 times a day. He LOVES it! Before we bought this game, he was SLOWLY and reluctantly finger-counting addition. He can now add and subtract 2 numbers (1-6) by memory. He also now understands even and odd. We've owned this game for 6 months, and he still loves to play it. My only problem is the durability. The box has been crushed flat, and the ink on the die rubbed off before the first month. I occasionally use a Sharpie to re-write the numbers and plus and minus. I still think it's a great game and have purchased them as gifts.$LABEL$1,0,-100

A model of how BluRay audio and video should be done. This concert and this recording are a real gems. The concert itself has many great talents and the songs are well-chosen and performed. The audio is truly superb with perfect mixing of voice and instruments, and there is very satisfying surround channel content. I just bought it, but it is already one of my favorite BluRays. The disc would be a great choice to demonstrate any home theatre. Even the menu system on the disc is well-designed. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great Little Lights. We have bollard lights in front of our house. It was easy to run wiring and hook-ups there. The back of the house was more difficult. These solar lights were the perfect answer and the style matches what is in front...great!

Lacking in suspense, thick with cliche. This is the worst film in the long running "Halloween" series. By trying the desperate attempts of bring in a new story line about a bizzare paganistic cult is more funny than frightening, the use of gore in this film is shocking, belting it out to hideous and camp levels with no style or originality.The only elements that are worth credit are the revamped score and the fact the mask in this movie is closer to that of Carpenter's orginal.$LABEL$0,0,-100

BookWorm. Ahhh, painful!I engulfed Brown's "The Lost Symbol". I expected this one to be just as good. However, three chapters into it, I wanted to jump into the book and slap the characters around because they were so annoying. Everything about this book is annoying. The coincidences are just too many; the characters are predictable. I knew exactly how it will end three chapters into the book! The fact that the professor goes through all those coincidental circumstances is just ridiculous. Also, Brown keeps re-writing the same thing over and over again....I don't know how many times he described TRANSLTR to the reader...at one point, I literally said out loud: "ok, I get it, move the hell on!".Maybe this book sucked because it was one of his firsts...not sure. Definitely wouldn't recommend it, because the reader will be disappointed. I liked his "The Lost Symbol", "Angels and Demons", and the "Da Vinci Code".

Indiana Jones's "Kid Brother" meets the evil Set. If your looking for a serious horror movie here, you are looking in the wrong place! There is nothing scary in this except how much they borrowed from other movie themes. Can't anyone think of something original?? This guy is a archaeologist...and wants to throw the other team off the track of the find...so he plants a artifact in loose sand, and expects the other team to fall for it....Idiot! They also find King Tut's tomb under like 5 inches of sand...WOW...that was hard! This movie is very well written...for a High School kid...actually, I take that back, as my daughter (16) and I were laughing through the whole thing. Very silly movie.

Great, but..... We love the VentAir system on the whole. With my daughter, the slow flow nipples worked great but with our newborn, they seem Too slow. At the hospital, he was started on the Simulac ready to eat bottles and they are a much faster flow than these so we have problems using these. It takes 20 min for him to eat 1oz. I May have to switch to the fast flow to see how that works for him because the nipples from the ready to eat bottles put a lot of air from the bottom, defeating the purpose of the bottles design$LABEL$1,0,-100
People Shouldn't Be Ashamed!. This story is about a young deaf girl who is about 5 years old and who has an older sister who is around 12 years old. They both have long silky straight black hair. The best part of the book is that it had a lot of movement in the pictures. However, the pictures were black and white and some were shaded in. They had nice big backgrounds in the story too. I recommend this story for little kids between 6 and 8 years old. If you read this book you will find a lot of things you will like. This book reminds me of my great grandfather who is losing his hearing and it looks a lot like my house in the inside.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Mis-Lead. Front of Package:"Free Lead in Water Test Kit - See Details Inside the Package" (look at the image)Ok, opened the package, not seeing this Lead test kit.Whats this? A business reply card - no postage necessary.This was a card to mail in to receive a free lead test kit mailed to you within 2 weeks.Wait 2 weeks for the test, then mail in the sample.To get the results you must pay $30!I received a letter from the city stating that a small percentage of homes built in my area, in the time frame my home was built, may have higher than acceptable levels of lead. So I go to the store to buy a kit specifically for lead, and the clerk points to this one - "cool," I thought, "I get the lead test for free, and can go ahead and test for the other stuff too."

She is now in the process of pushing her yound children to suicide. I read this book with hopes of finding answers and help. It was a joke.

If you want real information about Asperger's Syndrome google on-line support groups. There you will see the pain and destruction these people cause.

See It For What It Is. I finished the book last night and loved it. Rebecca's writing style is inspiring and beautiful. The story was engaging enough for me to finish in two sittings. Every life is worth a novel and we should all be so lucky as to write ours down for others to read. Many of these reviewers are judging Rebecca's choices or her parents emotional distance or accusing the book of being published only because she is Alice Walker's daughter. But there are thousands of books published each year by not so famous children. Rebecca could have rested on her duff and done nothing, but instead she used her talent as a writer to heal something inside of herself by telling her story. Read the book for what it is - an interesting account of one woman's coming of age, one woman's account of being biracial in America, one woman's story in a sea of millions. I applaud her.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Light and melodic:. Australia's Neuropa have put together a synth-popper's dream in Beyond Here and Now. It's well paced and flows evenly throughout. All the songs are uplifting, filled with smooth harmonies, and tight synths. The vocals are delightful as the lyrics are personal, heartfelt. I was a bit concerned that the cover of Erasure's "True Love Wars" would be weak, quite the contrary, it's every bit as good as the original>>hats off fellas. Other stand out tracks are:"Beyond Here and Now," which is a great opener, "Bound," "Lifeline," and "New Day," all just perfect examples of high grade velveeta elektro pop, which is a good thing! "In Need" is the closest track to a ballad, also strong material. "True Believer" is worth a mention. Again, no poor songs and only one instrumental...$LABEL$1,0,-100

Wonderful book, inexcusable formatting. Gertrude Stein is Gertrude Stein. What inspired me to write this review was the ABDOMINABLE publishing job done by [...]. The price is right, sure, but this book exemplifies what is wrong with the amazon mindset of cheaply produced books. Gertrude Stein is a challenge to get through on a good day, but with .25" margins and tiny type, digireads makes the process pretty unbearable. I do not understand why they sacrificed just about everything that makes book-reading pleasurable in order to save what probably amounts to a few pennies. I take total responsibility for opting for the cheapest book, however, I will never do this again.

This is only my second listen to the band's repertoire, as my first was their 4-track 'Taste The Pain' EP (see my review).

Loyal Jance fan but greatly disappointed in this book. I want to start by saying that I am a diehard Jance fan. I love the JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady novels but I found this one so disturbing that I gave it up after 100 pages and just flipped to the end.Why? It was very gory, graphic and disturbing. I, personally, felt no reason to have included such graphic, detailed child rape and murder scenes. The bottle scene and others were just too much for me.When I read, I want to be entertained with a good story, perhaps some humor... and I don't want nightmares. This one definitely could give a sensitive soul nightmares for days.I'm not giving up on Jance but, I disagree with another review, I don't see this character being her most memorable.

Buy the subtitled version instead; it does the anime justice. <i>Revolutionary Girl Utena</i>, or <i>Shoujo Kakumei Utena</i> in the Japanese, is a brilliant and complex anime, which contains the best writing and art I have ever seen. It's really unfortunate that the dub job is so terrible. The English-language acting makes even the more profound moments of the series melodramatic and trite, and lines of dialogue have been changed from the actual translation (which can be found in the subtitled version) in such a way as to be offensive in more than one instance. The subtitled version is phenomenal; I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching a brilliant work of art, with amazing acting in the Japanese language. Words such as "travesty" are appropriate in this case, I think, to describe the butchering that took place in the dubbing of this series. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because the anime itself is so great even the dub job cannot ruin it completely.$LABEL$0,0,-100

So bad I had to get back in the review game!. This is an atrocity, an insult to taste and intelligence. There is NOTHING good about this movie-laughable script, miscasting, choppy plot, Schumacher loading the thing with all these turgid sex scenes like he's Brian De Palma or something...this movie did for numerology what "White Noise" did for EVP-that is to say, quash anyone's interest in the subject.There are many people here lauding this movie with high praise. It frightens me to know that they walk among us, and often without special helmets or close medical supervision.

What a Waste of Money!. I was delighted when I saw this book in the bookstore. Fortunately, I thumbed through it and thus avoided the mistake of buying it. I thought I must not be reading the measurements correctly because surely anyone could see that this method of measurement would render the information almost useless. I think somebody is in too much of a hurry to make money and is not thinking about the readers. Whoever is responsible for this book should be ashamed.

This is absolutely the worst toy. I purchased two of these and two cartridges for my children for christmas and they have been nothing but a hastle. They worked fine the first day but not since. I have gone through a ton of batteries as well and have actually had a few explode in the unit. Bottom line is that I would have rather spent my money on the pixter or a leapster than this piece of garbage.

Wonderful. This book clearly takes place in NYC, something my NYC nieces and I really enjoy - seeing Max's dad being a conductor on a train makes them laugh. Seeing the WTC in the background makes me smile and think. And of course the kids up and down the block where we live spend their life sitting on the stoop, just like Max does!The book makes great connections - each time somebody asks Max what he's doing, he plays the sound of something going on, and in the next panel he's using their bucket, or their hatbox, or their garbage cans to play his next rhythm.I strongly recommend this book to anyone, particularly anybody who is musically inclined.One note - the larger edition of this book is better. I got this edition because it was cheaper and in the bookstore, but the pictures end up a little scrunched.$LABEL$1,0,-100
No Eyeliner Needed. This CD came out at a time when heavy metal was suffering a woeful testosterone deficiency. Rooster-haired poseurs like Poison, Warrant, and Firehouse were getting all the attention, and bands who were true to blues and rock were being largely ignored.Enter a handful of bands who nixed the image gimmickery and just offered in-your-face rock/blues/metal. One of those outfits, Dangerous Toys, brought to the table a nice mix of punk, blues, Southern rock, and straight-forward metal. Ferocious vocals from Jason McMaster punctuated the no-nonsense attack, and the end result was a fine first effort from the Texas group.This is one of the handful of albums from the late 80s that I still listen to today. If you like your music BS-free, I highly recommend Dangerous Toys.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Too Much Night. Given Jackson's reputation as a great songwriter and musician, and my strong liking of "Real Men" (despite its preachy overbearing lyrics), I decided to try Night & Day.

Big Band Zappa at its finest. This album, in my opinion, is the highlight of Zappa's greatest period of work. The horn - dominated numbers fit perfectly with Frank's unique wah - wah style and George Duke's impressive keyboard work to produce an album that has lasted through time. From the long title cut to the ultra-funky keyboard riff of "Eat that Question" to the impressive, jazzy, and spacey sounds of "Blessed Relief," this album is definitely worth buying if you are into FZ's jazz-fusion instrumental works. Other albums that I would characterize with this album are: Hot Rats, Waka-Jawaka, Studio Tan, and Sleep Dirt. Get this CD and groove to FZ at his finest.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Must have for any Christian.. This book was referred to in another book that I was reading. I was enjoying that book so I checked Amazon for Brother Lawrence's book and ordered a copy. It has proven to be one of the BEST investments I have ever made. This tiny book is just amazing in the Truth that it delivers. Brother Lawrence seems to have been an exceptional human being blessed with tremendous Grace from God. It was so because he sought after it. I have recently traveled through losing a job and beginning a new one quite different from what I was used to. After 25 years of being a manager I am now punching a time clock and emptying my own trash. When I begin experiencing pride issues I can pick this book up and immediately be put in my place.

Beyond what limits?. Only a Discovery reality series could take climbing the highest mountain on earth and make it seem as melodramatic as The Real Housewives of New Jersey. Some of the characters (that's what they are after all) are truly inspiring, but when you get down to it, commercial summit expeditions aren't really very interesting.

Nice Sound, built like garbage, company doesn't care.. This unit has great sound and quite a punch. 22 Watt RMS, twin possition BBE processing for nice mids. But the biggest drawback is the quality of the unit itself. First off, the magic flap idea is unique. But the first problem I had is that it wouldn't always flip open for use, but continue to play. Next, All of a sudden all it would do is play the disc, and never even eject. I was stuck listening to the same disc for a couple of days. Then it just quit working all together. When I contacted Aiwa, They informed me that I was just days past the end of my warranty. It would therfore cost me 99.00 to get it fixed. End of story.This unit is either going in the trash, or I am going to send back to the manufacturer so they can shove it where they may. I will never buy another product from this company. And I would advise anyone I know to do the same. If you ask me, they don't deserve anyone's money.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Stylish, Affordable, Portable THUMP!. My wife told me she would get me a boombox for my birthday (so I could jam to tunes at work). DANG, but she wasn't kidding about the BOOM! I was expecting something a little smaller and wimpier, but no dice ... this thing gets LOUD. And with the adjustable bass (three settings: no bass, some bass, lots-o-bass) it sounds really full and not "tinny" or distorted when you crank it up. I only turned it up to 6 and it seemed like I was disturbing my neighbor's peace!Plus, the radio tuner is digital, so you know if it sounds crackly that it ain't YOUR fault. I always have to pay a lil' bit for the good sound when it comes to boomboxes, but it pays off, because I'm hard on them -- 3 or 4 years, tops. We'll see if this one can beat it.Overall, I think this is a pretty good box, especially for the price.

AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE.......... At first I thought this was going to be a cheesy video but in a matter of minutes I was laughing out loud. It's hilarious! The ad libs, the audience participation, wonderful old time television. The picture quality is not A-1 but that can't be expected from the old kinescope recordings but it is still very good. There really is not much "unknown" stuff here but the video itself is great. Wonderful to see Sinatra, Ethel Barrymore, Liberace, Donald O'Connor and more. Also nice to see Mrs. Durante and Jimmy's adopted daughter CeCe speaking about their husband and father. My personal opinion of this DVD is five stars in spite of whatever flaws it has.

Historical romance with the realities of life..... So many times historical romance books have problems come up that don't speak to our time. The complexities of the relationships are often times very base and minimal. This book has the fierce complexities of human relationships reminiscent of Wuthering Heights but with a better ending. This books centers around a classic tale of the musician and his muse but told in a more colorful way. I very much appreciated the authors characters, the diversity of the characters lives and the vivid imagery. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was that from about 75% through to about 85% thought there was a huge lag in the story with a bunch of filler.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Just plain aggravating. Spent too much time researching cordless phones ended up going with this one given that it appeared to have the most positive reviews. Have owned it for about 5 months along with an extra headset. Bottom line this phone is poorly conceived and engineered and just plain aggravating at times. There is almost a constant buzzing sound in the background (I am not running a WIFI network), the controls on the handset are very complicated (way more so than even the most "advanced" cell phone) and I consider myself a technofile. I just wanted a high quality cordless phone that had a good signal, battery life, looked good and was free of defects what I got was a phone with questionable sound quality and a need for a PHD to figure out how it works. For those of you with a temper save yourself from eventually chucking this phone at the wall and look elsewhere.$LABEL$0,0,-100

okay, but not THAT good. it's alright, but a little hokey and dated, and i don't know what book most of the other reviewers on this page read. two young men find a manuscript in the ruins of a castle about a guy shooting white pigs out his window. wow. talk about "cosmic dread" and "icy terror". there was nothing spectacular or even slightly memorable about this book, except the beginning. the reason everyone gives such verbose praise to this thoroughly forgettable, antiquated novel is that lovecraft said a few good words about it. but let's remember our friendly neighborhood sheep, he was a man of his times, and i seriously doubt that if he was alive he would have such lavish praise for this novel now. lovecraft's material dated well (except for the racism), so did blackwood's (aside from the pantheism), so did lefanu and bierce's:hodgson's most certainly did not. skip it and read something by arthur machen or thomas ligotti.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Dr.Benjamin Hobhouse. This is a book which simplifies QFT in a way not suitable for learning the real principles and theoretical foundations of QFT. It uses the synthetic path integral approach only, whilst the canonical approach is more appropiate to understand the foundations of QFT. For this, it is not enough to know how to write down the path integral and calculate scattering amplitudes only. It is good for an experimentalist, who wants to apply the theory of QFT to his measurments and vice versa. Who wants only to have a glance at QFT (including recent developemants) without being too superficial, the book of Michele Maggiore or the book of Thomas Banks are more useful, exactly because they present both approaches. For a major in QFT the book of George Sterman can be recommended.$LABEL$0,0,-100

This is the first shampoo I've ever used that makes my hair feel really clean and not weighed down, without causing it to feel dried out.

The best just got better!. I have had a couple of pairs of iGrado's for the past 3 years or so. The cable they came with are very thin and do not handle wear. I've been looking for cable replacements (yes, the iGrado's are worth salvaging) but decided it was cheaper and easier to just buy new ones. Well to my surprise, the new ones are better. The cable is much thicker with a thick jacket. The Y split in the cable is much more rugged and the plug is a nice L shape now. I also noticed the headband is wider and a little more comfy. Best of all, they sound the same--GREAT.Do not be fooled by other reviews of behind-the-head headphones that get 4 and 5 stars--they sound nowhere near as good as the iGrado's. If you want good bass and a great sound from top to bottom in the behind-the-ear form factor, the iGRADO's are THE BEST. Don't spend half to ultimately be unsatisfied.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Classic synth sounds!. Touch is another synthpop masterpiece by Eurythmics that has stood the test of time very well. Not quite on the level of Sweet Dreams, it nevertheless contains brilliant songs like the atmospheric Here Comes The Rain Again with its evocative lyric, the compelling Right By Your Side with its riveting reggae beat and the soulful Who's That Girl. The arrangements are innovative throughout and lend merit even to the lesser songs like Regrets with its frisky trumpets. Another favorite of mine is Paint A Rumour with its skittering beat and subtle synth flourishes - it really grows on you. On Touch, Eurythmics consolidated the sound they introduced on Sweet Dreams, before they veered off into new directions with 1985's Be Yourself Tonight and the following year's Revenge. It remains a synth-pop classic.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Thumbs down on this one.... I just finished reading this book and all I can say is that it's like reading one of those "for entertainment purposes only" astrology books. The things the author has to say about my AB blood type just do not fit with reality as I know it. He has my physiology wrong and my personality wrong- and wrong in some very fundamental ways. Foods he says I shouldn't eat are foods that I do well on and foods that he recommends as highly beneficial give me heart burn. He says people with my blood type don't lose weight using lo-carb, high fat and protein diets i.e. (Dr.Atkins). In actuality- the Atkins diet is the only way I have ever been able to lose weight. For anyone sincerely interested in improving their health, I would recommend reading "Sugar Blues" by William Dufty, "NeanderThin" by Ray Audette and "Dr Atkins New Diet Revolution" by Dr. Atkins. These are good solid books that have seriously helped me. Not pseudo science like "Eat Right for Your Type".$LABEL$0,0,-100

Welcome Back Bob. In the era of bubblegum pop crammed down our throats by the diluge of boy bands, teen-pop princesses, and tasteless record executives, Dylan's newest, "Love and Theft" is the stuff dreams are made of... perfect songwriting, lyrical prowess, and one of the tightest bands ever assembled. Dylan's latest masterpiece is the long-awaited follow up to the 1997 multi-Grammy award winning "Time Out of Mind" and is more than worth the wait. If you love top-notch songwriting and the incredible group dynamic possessed by Dylan's latest band (his road band for the last several years), you need to do yourself a favor and pick up this album!Sadly, this album was released on the same date as the horrible terrorist attacks in NYC and Washington. However, leave it to Bob Dylan and his impeccable songwriting talents to add some joy and pleasure into a dark and dismal day in American history. A true masterpiece.$LABEL$1,0,-100

No single player campaign... I'm giving Red Orchestra a bad review as it is just plainly false advertising. I don't have high speed internet and bought the game in a local store thinking by looking at the case it had a actual single player mode... it doesn't. It did say a internet connection was required to activate the game, it does not say if you have 56K you will be downloading for 4+ days just to get a glimpse of the game.I usually buy games for the single player mode as I don't have a choice of getting broadband where we live, I guess I'll be more careful when it comes to these kinds of products.The game, once I got to it, was pretty cool but gets boring fast in the practice mode, there is no campaigns etc for a single player. I'd give the gameplay a nice score say 4 stars, if you got broadband this would definately be a good game to purchase. But they need to describe the game and the hoops you need to jump through to play it more thoroughly on the packaging...$LABEL$0,0,-100

Fantastic Romance/Drama. This is the first book that I have read from this author and I am greatly impressed. After reading the opening chapter, I felt as if I was home again. Everyone who reads this will be able to relate to the characters. Whether it be to Randi & Kay personally, to their families or to their workplaces. I really enjoyed how you never knew from one moment to the next what their ex's were up to. All of the characters are richly drawn and real to life. Unlike many books written these days you really do not know how it will end. Will they admit their feelings for each other? And if they do, will they still in the end to back to their ex's out of guilt or fear? This book is a roller coaster ride that I highly recommend. Kudos.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Lennon Acoustic. This is a piece of Lennon history. It travels from some intimate moments with John, to some stellar live performances. The album moves at a nice pace, it doesn't drag at all. The three live recordings are very good. Real Love sounds great here. What caught me by surprise was Look At Me. Though it has a great message, the sound of the original always turned me off a bit. This version helped me to embrace John's lyrics.For some reason, Amazon lists an extra track, "I'm A Man". This is not a track on the album.

To be read with caution. This book amasses a lot of information from different sources, apparently more interested in capturing the reader's attention at any cost rather than in giving accurate information. Some statements are a challenge to the basic facts of Portuguese history and a challenge to the basic notions of history periods in general. There is no such thing as a "pre-historic Lusitania" as this book says. In level of mediocrity this book is comparable to Ian Robertson's A Traveller's History of Portugal, two books to be read (if at all) with a good deal of caution.$LABEL$0,0,-100

pretentious and contrived. Being a huge fan of the science fiction genre, I was delighted to learn of a sci fi movie whose theatrical release I somehow missed. And Bruce Willis playing the hero being means it must be a sure fire hit, right ?Wrong ! This was truly the most contrived and unimaginitive piece of drivel I have seen in a long time. And no, I'm not "slow" or unsophisticated. I just didn't see any ideas here which had not been done, significantly better, by Star Trek, Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The only character I found modestly intriguing was the opera singer alien. And she got wasted rather quickly, leaving only the highly stereotypical characters. The above average visuals were not enough to redeem the tired plot.My advice is rent it if you are really curious. It was certainly not worthy of being added to my fine sci fi DVD collection.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A book that says nothing. I rarely write reviews on Amazon, but I can't help but try to save someone else from the frustration of wasting time on this book. While I typically enjoy almost any business book, this one was painful. Lots of mumbo-jumbo with no real substance, this book continually uses it's own title as though it were a buzzword that had some sort of real meaning. Since it was only vaguely (at best) defined the whole book is very foggy and unclear.You know how you often times have to wade through the first chapter or two of a book to get to the meat? You feel like it hasn't really said anything but is just about to get going? You'll still feel like that when you get to the end of this one.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Weak Sloppy Art and Poor Writing Insult the Series. The orginal 8 episode Bubblegum Crisis is a masterpiece of great futuristic anime and one of my all time favorites. The art in this new version 2040 is a total insult to the franchise and looks worse than the Flintstones or Scooby-Doo. I mean you have these monsters that look like a paper cut out with a couple of holes and bolt, and none of the great writing that came with the original. I almost never bash anime but in this case the art is so bad it deserves it. It is like someone just picked up the title to make a quick yen and spent no time, money, or thought on it because they were counting on the fame of the original to sell it. I am sure they made their money because of that but this is truly the worst quality anime I have ever seen, yes, the worst. Don't reward these makers of junk who insult the awesome original Bubblegum Crisis.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Solid book on introductory QM. This book is a good place to start your introductory study of QM. The historical material at the start provides a good motivaion and perspective on further developments in QM. All the important and pivotal aspects of Nonrelativistic QM are worked out in considerable details and this is a boon for a newcomer. Studying books like Merzbacker or Schiff becomes easy after this. The only shortcoming is the lack of problems, most are exercises.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Great, with one mistake. Like the other reviewer said, this is a great 1 disc distillation of The 2 CD "Cup of Loneliness" compilation that also adds "She Thinks I Still Care" from the United Artists period. If you want more than this get "Cup of Loneliness" and The Razor and Tie "She Thinks I still Care". For some reason, both this and the other Mercury compilation substitute a rerecording of "Why Baby Why". I don't know why since they use the orginals of a couple other Starday recordings. Anyway, if you want the original version, which I think is better, you'll find it on Columbia's Spirit of Country, and probably a 100 other compilations.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Better than Kiss The Girls. I think Morgan Freeman was superb, as always. I was pleasantly surprised with the acting of Monica Potter though. I think that the suspense was great, with plenty of twists through the movie. It was much better than Kiss The Girls in fact, a movie I could figure the "bad-guy" out before it was half over. The only bad thing I can say about the movie, is the car crash in the beginning. It looked terrible, and was too obvious it had been done on computers. If you enjoy drama/suspense films, you'll surely enjoy this one.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Great book with great ideas simplified. This book is as good as a thick textbook on copywriting. Mr. Kennedy doesnt waste words and gets to the point in every sentence in this book. Also of great interest are copies of sales letters he wrote for his clients.What I liked about this book was chapter/step 6: Getting your sales letter read. There are generous examples of attention-getting headlines and fill in the blank headlines. A lot of these caught my attention and I'm very picky about which emails to open because I've looked at thousands of them, but the samples in this book are still good to use.I like this book because it is like AWAI's copywriting course condensed into one book.Read this book today and start writing better copy.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Nice Collection. Even though Hanson are viewed as that lil boy group that sang that "Mmm Bop" song, one might be surprised to know that they did more after that and even still have a small, but very devoted fanbase. This set represents their work from 1997-2000. It has the singles that made them famous from their first album including their only two top 10 hits "Mmm Bop" and "I Will Come To You." They also had minor hits with "Where's the Love", "This Time Around", "Weird", and "If Only." This even includes a track from their Christmas album.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointed. This book was a great disappointment to me. I love books that have a real setting and yet there is a touch of magic thrown in. Christopher Moore is a master at this type of narrative. He makes you feel as though YOU could stumble onto something mythical in your day to day life. "The Tooth Fairy" did not deliver this. This was a sexually twisted piece of writing. The book might have been more enjoyable if it had just given in to its erotic fixation fully and quit trying to be a creepy coming of age story.

Example: The book references both "the CD included" and a web site to download the files - NEITHER OF WHICH EXIST. The source code listed in the book is full of errors.

Bedwetting has been a very tough lingering issue for us, as she has a very small bladder and is a very deep sleeper. She wore it 3 times. The first time it did not work for some reason. The next couple, it kind of did. Although it certainly wasn't the picture perfect buzzer goes off, so she goes to the bathroom scenario. Honestly at the time I didn't think it worked, and that I had bought a lemon of a product. But, the couple of times it buzzed her awake seems to have done the trick.All in all I bought it so that she would stop bedwetting on the advice of her pediatrician. She has completely stopped now for a couple of months. So I have to rate this product a 5 star for coming through on it's claims. Certainly not clockwork or an amazing process, but very effective apparently.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Not good. I'm a Boston fan from way back. It seems as though with each album they've made, it gets worse as time goes by. I'm at a loss for why, too. Scholz wrote most of the music back in the "old days" and Fran Cosmo sounds creepily like Brad Delp (for the most part). But this outing is far below par. Far below. The best song on here is Cryin'. It really sounds like they should sound. Cryin' is really a good song. The rest, to me, is filler.Also, all the feel-good environmental, save-the-animals stuff plastered all over the booklet is a big turn off. It comes off as some left-wing baloney to me. I'm all for protecting the environment and unnecessary slaughter of animals, but they go too far in the cd booklet.Of course, those that read this and disagree will have all kinds of nasty things to say. But that's the hallmark of the left today. Disagree with them and they WILL attack.I'm Libertarian, btw, for all the kooks' knowledge.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Christmas gift. The problem I have with this purchase does not involve the product, but rather the company that I purchased them from. I had these shoes sent to my son as a gift. Unfortunately, they were shipped with the ink-filled security button still in place, so he was unable to wear them, and since they were an online order item, it has been an extreme inconvenience to make a return. The company sent another pair of shoe with the instructions that they would also send a pre-paid mailing label, so my son could return the original pair. When I spoke to my son last week, he had not yet received the return label. I am waiting now to see if my credit card has been billed twice for this item. I am very unhappy with this purchase.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Worked very well for me. I was somewhat surprised to see this trap rated so poorly because I had very good luck with it. It was the third kind I tried and I the first my mice weren't able to outsmart. Caught the whole family living in my garage over the course of a couple of months (one at a time of course). I agree with the reviewer who said you do need a hard, level, flat surface (like my concrete garage floor) for them to work properly. Also, Re: the person who said that they don't always lock shut, a tiny squirt of WD-40 on the yellow plastic tab completely eliminated that problem. They get a 4/5 only because they are a pain to clean out after each use (bait + frightened mouse = lots of pooping & peeing). Also need to get that mouse out quickly because they will overheat in such a small space and die, missing the point of a humane trap.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A Great Read. This is my first book by this author and I found it well written and its story interesting, exciting and occasionally humorous. Unnecessarily vulgar, it's true, but once you've accepted that, most entertaining. I will now look at some of her other books. If you don't mind a lot of X-rated language, I would certainly recommend it.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Brings in the waist, but that's about all.. This bra is fantastic for wearing under vintage clothing, when you're going for that bullet bra look. It brings in the waist and provides that lovely rib-cage shaping so vital for 50s "new look" dresses. However, it offers very little in the way of cup support and nothing in the way of the kind of cup molding that is common with modern brassieres. This means that the wear one can get from this undergarment is very limited, particularly for small-busted ladies.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Nice typeface. I like the typeface that the publisher uses here, but beyond that, there is little good I can say about this book. It's boring. The author does little to intergrate her discussions of different aspects of the geography of Mexico. It's just like, Here are the Pyramids...Bam! Here are some folk dancers.And then there's this little piece of propaganda..."...the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This agreement made it easier and less expensive for Mexico to trade goods with its North American neighbors."No discussion beyond that. then bam! on to Fiestas, Music, and Arts!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Affordable, straightforward. Bought and installed the two-bike version. For an inexpensive item, I have no complaints. Certainly, it's only as sturdy as your wall-mount point (since the spine is assembled from several shorter square pipe segments, it would not hold vertical by itself, even if bike weight were well balanced). If I had my druthers, it would not hang the bikes quite as far out from the wall (a road bike or kids bike only needs 10-inch arm for hook, and this is longer), but it's a one-size-fits-all solution, and will handle even fairly wide mountain bars easily.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Had know idea what it was about.. I watched this movie because someone else recommended it and said it was "profound". What was profound about it for me is how eastern, mystical, religious thought packaged for western society via a movie can come across as it so often does. Touching, yet missing the mark when it comes to truth. Nevertheless, the acting was good and there were some touching scenes trying to proselytize the audience with its message.$LABEL$0,0,-100
A big no-no. OK, there are times you want to relax by watching something easy and entertaining, so you go for a movie with a bit of this'n'that: action, violence, humor, romance. This was my premise when choosing this movie. I was hoping for very uncomplicated fun, with some mystery, action, intrigue, romance, etc. Let's face it, we might love gourmet cuisine, but every once in a while a hotdog sounds really good. Well, this hotdog was a real dog. Sure, this is a straightforward movie, with an easy to follow plot, and with many of the ingredients listed above, but the end result was bad. Wesley Snipes is such a talented actor, and somehow he gets these roles where he is a thuggy good guy, decent but not very bright, getting in trouble (as usual). Alan Alda was disappointing as the National Security Advisor. The only refreshing character was Dennis Miller almost playing himself. But in summary, this movie was way too lame and predictable, better left on the shelves.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Dangerously In Love More Like Dangerous In Skills. Beyonce Giselle Knowles, showcased her writing skills, her vocals, parts that she has not shown the world. This CD is worth 10 stars. It is on the same level as Aaliyah's Aaliyah CD. Her collaborations are perfect. Missy Elliot did a good song, Signs. And the Luther duet, Closer I Get To You, was sung much better by these two than Donnie And Roberta. Her ballads, and her uptempo songs balance out with giving u enough of both.

Good idea, bad product. I bought this clock for my 9-year old. The sound quality is so poor that it's difficult to understand both my son's self-recorded wake up message, and the clocks pre-recorded time announcement. The volume is so loud we put the clock in a drawer when our baby is napping (in another room). Additionally, the clock is supposed to announce the time if you clap. However, it announces the time in response to all sorts of noises, such as "THREE EIGHTEEN AM" when my son rolls over in bed. High points for durability because I've "accidently" knocked it off the dresser, top bunk etc. several times and it keeps ticking. Skip it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

B-side myself. I can't believe that the Beatles had the nerve to release such a load of garbage. As a Beatles fan, it hurts me. I felt nauseaous the first time I listened to this album all the way through. There are 30 songs on the White Album. Maybe three of them are of the usual, high Beatles quality. I'm so sick and tired of bands releasing albums that aren't worthy of themselves. And the Beatles started it all with this travesty. Songs like "Good Night" and "Long, Long, Long" have no business being on anything except a b-sides album. It's shocking that they ever released this whole thing. Beatles fans shouldn't even bother to defend this album. We should stand as far back from it as possible. Oh, well. Obladi, Oblada, life goes on.

Better than Vanilla Ice. I'll be nice.Relative to a pool of vomit, this album is pretty solid. I'd rather have this album thrown at me at high speeds than a chainsaw.

At my next birthday party, I'd much rather you sing than a man that could make Earth explode with his voice. If I needed a drinking buddy, I'd rather it be you than someone with an uncontrollable bladder that also happens to be a recovering alcoholic whose wife is only giving him one last chance before she kicks him out of the house and takes his kids, that being the final straw before he flips out and murder's my grandfather.$LABEL$0,0,-100

easy read. Ok, this book has its plusses and minusses. The plusses:great info, preseted in a easy to read and comprehensive fashion. It covers quite a bit in regards to the effect of insulin and simple sugars on body fat. The author also does a nice job explaining how exactly to follow a low carb diet as well as how to follow a high carb, very low fat diet.The minus: He's a little hedgy here in that he never really gives his opinions regarding what fat loss plan is best or ideal. He leaves that up to the reader to make his own decision. While I can appreciate he may have wanted to cover several topics and to leave the choice open to the reader, I think, with his knowledge in the field, he has done the reader an injustice by not being exactly clear which diet is best.Overall, enjoyed the book, was pleased and impressed and am putting a "strong buy" recommendation on it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

It is long enough that it can stay in the car for a week at a time and will not become one of those that you thrash for a few days and then never play again. As they say 'all thrill, no fill'.

As a huge sleeper fan,I anxiously awaited the follow up to their brilliant album "The It Girl."When I read that the new album was a flop and was not even being released in the U.S.,I was determined to buy the record (as Import) and decide for myself.After all ,most rock critics are total losers and love to slag this band for whatever reason.When the record arrived I put it on and within about 5 seconds of the opening track "Please,Please,Please"I knew my faith in the band was well placed.I feel this is the best Sleeper record to date.Fans of bands like Blur and Elastica would probably like this.Standout tracks "Traffic Accident","Rollercoaster"and "Firecracker" are Sleeper at their absolute best.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Really really boring - yuk!. Ray Liotta has been in some bad movies, but this one ranks right up there among the very worst. Some reviewers enjoyed the love story, but these two would-be star-crossed lovers were incredibly unappealing to me and dull. This film didn't work for me on either level - boring love story or boring revenge story. I usually enjoy even the bad Ray Liotta movies because he can be so delightfully crazy, but he isn't quite crazy enough in this one even though he's the bad guy (he does make an attempt toward the end to come through, but it's too late by then - anybody who has stuck with the movie this far, doesn't really care by now.). If you really want a star-crossed lover's tale, surely you can dig up something more exciting than this one; and there are definitely better revenge plots out there than this one. I wanted to smack Alan and Ella by the end of the movie for being such sappy idiots. They deserve each other.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Excellent contribution to the 1990s rock-blues!. This band is hot. If you like SRV and the stylings of other Texas guitarists, then this CD is for you. Though Indigenous draws definite influence from these bands (as well as greats like Jimi Hendrix), they are unique. Mato Nanji has to rank as one of the best guitarists in the country, and his unique voice adds a new flavor to blues-rock.

NOT THIS ONE.. The first volume is very good but not this one. Basically it's the original versions of all the songs that METALLICA cover on GARAGE INC.The first volume makes one solid collection, and though this one has some killer tunes its a disoriented mix. Songs like TUESDAYS GONE, which I love, Lynyrd Skynyrd rocks, but it doesn't fit here.The first disc is the stuff that was underground when METALLICA was coming up the ranks. Its the stuff you'd expect to hear. The stuff that mom hates and it makes your ears bleed.The second has LOVERMAN by Nick Cave and the Seeds.WHile it isn't bad, it just seems to me like a way to make more money. I'm not sure I like the whole concept of this thing anyway. I mean, its not like these bands aren't awesome on their own.

A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.... If you liked Steve Martin's movie, A Simple Twist of Fate, (he adapted the screenplay) then you will probably like this book. It was a fast easy read. I blew through it in a couple of hours on a plane. An interesting story about being alone in a world full of beautiful people, when you don't feel so beautiful yourself. The emotional rollercoaster of day to day life, when you wonder if the anti-depressants are still working and a coming of age story for all three of the main characters. It's a different side of Steve Martin, his intellegence and wit shines. It's a curl up on the sofa and waste a rainy afternoon kind of book.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Surrealistic and Whimsical. Yoshimoto's style isn't for everyone -- her writing is simple and straightforward, and these qualities too often aren't given the credit they deserve. Somehow she manages to use this method to tell stories from the unusual to the bizarre to the magical -- and in so doing brings elements of metaphysics or science fiction into the everyday.

My balls are damaged.... I ordered a pair of the medium iron baoding balls several weeks ago as a gift for my boyfriend. Although they shipped and arrived quite promptly, the box was of poor quality and the baoding balls themselves were damaged. They appeared to be used, with scratches and even nicks in the balls. As each ball was wrapped individually and nestled into the fitted box, these damages could not have resulted from shipping.I am disappointed and am now back to searching for another gift I can get to replace these.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Epson 3200 and Software Review. I found the Epson 3200 to be an excellent upgrade from my Epson 1640. The Epson twain and the Smart Panel software worked without any problems and the scans are great. What would improve their software is to provide a PDF file for the User Guide instead of the HTM file. What I was disappointing in was the SilverFast software. After changing a few settings the software stopped working altogether. LaserSoft, the company that makes SilverFast, does not provide any non-chargeable phone support for installation problems. Many companies offer a 30-day free installation support but not LaserSoft. Fortunately, I found a software upgrade on the Internet but it does make one wonder about quality control. Also, I found their manuals difficult to read. It appears that they were written by engineers and embellished by product management. A good technical writer and editor could certainly improve the documentation.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Inaccurate - useless.. Great concept, but it's not accurate. My daughter clearly has a fever. She is burning up, flushed cheeks, clammy. The thermometer first said 94.6. Then it said 100.3. Then it said 95.2. Then it said 97.3. And then it said 96.5. That's a huge range of temps. I cannot rely on this thermometer and would urge you to find another brand.

Revolting stuff. Anyone interested in the revolting history of Christian anti-Semitism can find one of the founding documents here. I am amazed that two people posted reviews of this book and didn't even mention the truly disgusting language and images employed by this so-called "Saint."

Ultra Mouse MISSING THE "ULTRA". Before Gyration Inc. can compete in the Mouse & Keyboard arena, they must learn to design products that are COMPLETELY in sync with Windows! I even took extra steps in downloading all drivers needed from the Gyration Website, but this slick and very design driven package still couldn't give an "Ultra Performance". The Keyboard would sometimes read and sometimes not...and the mouse would force Windows to crash! It's too bad, I wanted it to work.

Long-distance hike through knee-deep mud. I couldn't wait to get this book after reading the reviews. I'm a lover of serious literature. I was disappointed to find the characters loathsome and tedious. I need at least one person in a story whom I like and am rooting for. I didn't even feel compassion for these people. They are so infuriatingly self-destructive, irresponsible, selfish, and emotionally lazy.The story itself was long, slow and unengaging. I dragged myself through it in hopes of a pay-off in the end, but the "corrections" were skimpy, simplistic, and left me frustrated and irritable. The writing itself was pretentious and tiresome. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.Franzen seems skilled and smart, but defeated by his own self-consciousness. I hope to see better from him.$LABEL$0,0,-100
DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!. This is probably the worst tax software I have every purchased. I've been using TurboTax and TaxCut for years and this year I have had nothing but problems from the state program and the Federal.For one, there are "fixes" that won't download. Everytime I do, the program crashes during installation.I am hoping that I get a refund from Amazon for the $89 I spent on the TaxCut Complete for Home & Business (same problem by the way) and the 24.50 I spent on the state program.I'm always going to purchase TurboTax from now on because the technical support at for this product blows.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!. The movie on the second disc is billed as the original theatrical release. This is only partly true. It was shown in 1977, but this was after it was cut to a commercial length. I am not a die hard purist, so don't get this wrong. However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character "Biggs" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length. I guess George Lucas just doesn't care about those of us who cherished the first release, which sadly now no longer exists for those who desire to see it. Shame on you Mr. Lucas!!Moral: Don't waste your money!$LABEL$0,0,-100

Highly recommend this stapler for heavy duty use.. We are a blueprint shop and have 4 offices. We do a lot of stapling of blueprints and this is the only stapler that holds the test of time and takes the abuse we put it through. If you have a lot of heavy duty stapling to do then this is your stapler. We have gone through a lot of them over the years but it's more how we use the stapler than the quality of it.We aren't crazy about the Bostitch staples though and usually purchase the heavy duty swingling staples as the bostitch tend to break easily.$LABEL$1,0,-100

comic masterwork.. I've read a few of Barth's books and this one standsout for sheer entertainment value and laughs. I thinkBarth has an original satirical mind but you mightnot agree.The book is long - and I'm a little averse to long novels.I dislike getting into a book and discovering thatI'm far from finishing and not enjoying it much - yetstill feeling somehow committed. I did not have thisproblem with The Sot-Weed Factor.Even right now I am reading an 800 page novel by one ofour great American writers... I'm halfway through itand wondering if anything interesting is going to happen,contemplating shelving the book and the writer can keephis secrets!You might find this book pompous and self-indulgent.

Don't bother reading this book unless you have a lot of time. This book was very boring unless you're into composers and very familiar with movements, symphonies, etc. Also, I found that I had to read almost half the book to really understand and define the characters.

Buen album. Este nuevo álbum, es el undécimo de su ya larga carrera. Si A toda esa gente cerraba un ciclo del grupo, Tánger hace que comience uno nuevo.Grabado a caballo entre Madrid y la propia ciudad magrebí, este nuevo trabajo es fruto de la investigación y estudio de las diferentes culturas musicales que, desde sus comienzos, ha centrado la base de la trayectoria musical de Medina Azahara. Son las raíces árabes, andaluzas y magrebíes las que, en mezcla perfecta con la vanguardia del rock, conforman la base de la música de fusión que siempre ha caracterizado al grupo. Estos son los temas del álbum:Danza al Viento, Como un sueño, Un instante junto a ti, Solo un camino, Regalarte una estrella, El lento atardecer, Confusión y realidad, Cuando se pierde el amor, Loco por ti, Deja de llorar, Tiempo de Abril, Solamente mía y Miénteme.El álbum ha sido disco de oro.$LABEL$1,0,-100

I really liked the show and would have liked to have watched it but the rapid fire editing made it maddening.

Crossroads of BORING!. I am extremely disappointed with this book. Robert Jordan has merely produced 700 pages of filler without furthering the story. It was not exciting. In fact, it was dull. The wheel of time did not turn at all with this installment. How much more nothing can I take?

title doesn't do the book justice. The title makes it sound like a clone of Atkins, but it's not. I think this is unfortunate, because the book gets lost in a sea of diet books. As a diet book, this isn't the best, but this is much more than just a diet book. There is some overlap in information, but Dr. Ullis puts much more emphasis on exercise with even a section of illustrated strength training exercises. Atkins and other low carb diets are about keeping insulin levels down to burn fat. Ullis talks about that, but also about balancing all your hormones for improved health, longer life, and to reverse the affects of aging. Unfortunately, he doesn't go into the technical details as much as I would like (which accounts for the deduction of one star), but there are definitely some good things to learn about this book. Ullis emphasizes not only what to eat and how to exercise, but also timing. So, I think this is a worthwhile read.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Not a good value at $999.

Terrible. Unfortunately this book was my introduction to LeGuin and I don't think I will ever be able to read anything else she's done because of it. I'll keep the review simple; The Telling was pretentious, plotless and without character development. I also got the impression that LeGuin was feeling pretty clever when she wrote it. It comes across as a mere outline for a novel; unfinished and exceptionally boring to the point that I could not bring myself to finish it.

Kill Uncle. Kill Uncle being Morrissey's 1991 release and his second studio album is very different and unconventional compared to his earlier releases.

Hoover Widepath vacuum - disappointing. I purchased this vacuum via Amazon because it was recommended by a well-known consumer rating magazine, and was affordable. It does have good suction and is very lightweight. However, the belt breaks very easily because there is no way to turn off the suction quickly if something large is accidently sucked into the machine. I have had the vacuum for four months, and have had to replace two belts.

Be prepared to lose a bunch of rice. Like basically everyone else, I bought this rice cooker to replace an old one, whose non-stick coating was starting to flake. The idea of a stainless steel bowl really appealed to me, but the reality of it is that you're going to lose a lot of rice when cooking a batch.There are a few recommendations for reducing the effect of this, the most helpful being to coat the bowl with oil (I haven't tried a cooking spray yet) prior to adding rice and water, but it won't completely solve the problem and it also affects the taste of the rice.Soaking the bowl overnight does allow for easy cleaning, but it's still a bummer to have a substantial layer of rice go down the sink (or, if you don't have garbage disposal, to be fished out of the strainer and into the trash).This might just be the trade off, for being able to avoid aluminum or non-stick coating, but be prepared for it.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Nothing really new, but enjoyable. I have to say, some people seem to expect a little too much from their entertainment. Considering that 95% of all anime is based on a ludicrous premise and then pretending it is normal, parent swapping hardly seems that far fetched when compared to giant robots and/or psychic powers. After all, excepting something that isn't normal as an operating truth is kind of the point. I think this series trys to show how easy it is to get confused by emotions. Also, this series made me laugh out loud quite a bit. Although I must admit that I just didn't care about the characters as much as the ones in series like "His and Her Circumstances", "Maison Ikkoku", "Boys Over Flowers", or "Fruit Basket". I would definitely recommend any of these if you have seen one of them and liked it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

As another reviewer commented, the comforter is a bit "slim", but that's what I wanted. Something light for the summer when the air is on and you just need a little bit of cover.

Entrepreneur Of The Year Says, "This is a Must-Read!". Our company used to be great at developing plans - we had grand plans, plans we'd worked on for months, and plans for our plans. We were planning experts. But we couldn't implement. Our plans sat in fancy binders and we pulled them out to look at them periodically, felt better because we had them, and couldn't figure out why things weren't happening like we'd planned.Then we read Mastering the Rockefeller Habits. And we found we could actually implement the plans that we learned how to develop from the methods and techniques defined in the book. We now have plans that work. And our company has matured tremendously as an organization from following the book. I strongly recommend that any company, from young start-up to those more mature, read and implement the strategies in this book. It will change your world.$LABEL$1,0,-100

This album clears up the past!. After just a few listenings of this CD, it becomes abundantly clear that Scott Stapp's contribution to Creed was much less than he would have had us believe. This album is shallow, OBVIOUS, and contrived. His "lyrics" are very simple and predictable, and the overall tone of the album is really a poorly executed clone of earlier Creed. What this album lacks is originality and imagination....well......that and a SONGWRITER.Oddly enough, I read an interview today with Scott Stapp saying that he WAS basically the whole Creed sound. I couldn't disagree more.......although the throaty voice that bores you to tears is here in this new effort, the songwiriting here is just very immature.. He said in the interview that similar to when Sting left the Police......HIS new sound would remain what Creed was.......Stapp should NEVER put himself in the same league with Sting......nor should he presume he has a clue as to how to write a hit song.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Nothing Like the Earlier Lindsays. Having the earlier Lindsay Quartet set of the Late Quartets, I was curious about their new, more recent, digital cycle. Unfortunately, their interpretation of the opp. 130 and 133 has become much sharper and more agressive. All of the dynmaics seem exaggerated and the whole performance seems so mannered that the players call attention to themselves rather than to the music. For a digital recording, the Takacs Quartet is superb. For good analogue, the earlier Lindsays and the Talich too. If you don't mind mono, the Hollywood and Busch Quartets are still hard to beat.$LABEL$0,0,-100

I found the book to be a dissappointment.. It is quite clear that the author knows what she is talking about, but trying to use the book is another matter. The examples are all without context.

Read it first in German. Am buying it in English for the sake of my almost 4 year old grandchildren. It is a wonderful "Why" book and a better "Why Not?" book equipped with the most restrictive of adult perspectives. The Stone Age tale is interspersed with modern references which are numbered. At the bottom of the page the references are identified as "anachronisms". I am hoping they use the same word in the English original. I find myself wishing that the same device was used with movies like Lion King. Our little boy twin is very interested in death. It would be helpful for him to know that having the father lion speak after death to his son was artistic license and does not really occur - at least not exactly like that. The book is droll. Sleeping under a stone blanket may deserve the warning: "This is pretend, don't let a heavy slab of rock fall on you just because you're tired!"$LABEL$1,0,-100
received broken. We received this with a broken blue handle and wheel. Our grandson was visiting from Chicago and when he opened it the wooden wheel fell off the blue handle.

So I wouldn't rate it good because of the flimsy design on the wheel and holder.$LABEL$0,0,-100
what a disappointment. Rented this b/c of all the hype. What a disappointment. I was almost uncomfortable watching it all. It seems like the best filming was during the stripping/dancing, and then the rest was low budget, fairly poor acting. I like C.T., I think he has skill...in this movie, he is just the meat. Matthew McCaughnehey was over-acting the entire film. Storyline was extremely predictable, and the ending was...well, what ending really? It's almost as if the writers just threw in a "love story" plot without taking the time to develop it, then the end comes and all of a sudden two people end up together? I could've skipped the flick. I've never reviewed a movie until now...just wanted to forewarn people. Wait till it's free for Prime Members!$LABEL$0,0,-100

While consuming "aggressors" ' deeds.... Really nice doco required a personal bravery and some financial gambling to produce while an artist traveled terrorist-infested zones of Iraq, the Palestinian Authority and frontier Israel.What I like in this movie personally is depicting the surrounding as visualized and seen by a stranger to localities. What does not grasp my appreciation much is openly aired producer's own interpretation of historical facts, which prepared a viewer to particular conclusions in advance explicitly.Nice music undisputedly as a nice idea of keeping peace worldwide was, to a reviewer's feeling, much spoiled with dilettante simplicity of complex affairs by a critic himself consuming the "aggressors" ` deeds either directly or indirectly.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Well worth the read!!. A compelling storyline..Addictive at times to the point of not being able to put the book down because you'll want to continue to read further to see what happens next. Well developed characters. Wish Zedd had more play in the book. Goodkind spent to much time on the Denna(Mord-Sith) and Richard's inter-action. Michael's role should have been a bit more developed.

Not a very good phone. I bought this phone with high hopes, but after a couple weeks it really has proven to be a disappointment.First off, there is an echo that comes and goes. It doesn't sound so bad on my end, but I keep having other people (including clients) complain about it. So that right there is a deal breaker.Second, the battery life is dismal on this thing. My last cordless would go through the day fine, even make it through an hour or so the next day if I forgot to charge it. This thing goes out after about 3 hours of talk time. I'm on the phone a lot, so I need something that lasts a little longer.Third, after just a couple weeks, I can already feel the flimsy nature of the phone. It's become clear that this will not go six months without breaking.Overall this is a very disappointing product from RCA. The concept of this phone is great, it's just clear that not a lot of concern was put into putting out a quality product.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Frontwoman Terri Nunn has a beautiful and powerful voice, she's got some pipes!The song, Take my Breath Away ultimately caused a riff between the band and their creative process became threatened due to the popularity of that song.

Card game genre hit the gamecube. This is the best game that no one knows about. It is a card game based (like Magic: The Gathering) RPG. This makes the game very interesting and fun. The graphics are superb (considering 2001 release), sound is okay, and the controls are very intuitive. The game is relatively easy for an RPG, with occasional places of difficulty. The gameplay downside is that levels beaten can not be reentered until after beating the game. This is a great game for both card game and RPG fans and I look foward to Lost Kingdoms II.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Jack Flynn wins again...and it's even more fun.... McGrory continues the winning saga of Jack Flynn. The book is longer than the first in the series and perhaps a bit better. The plot avoids some of the aburdist elements of the first. The book is paced well and Flynn remains a charmer. It was nice to see how he has grown in life. I was surprised to see that the FBI love interest from the first book was not even mentioned here. What happened to her? Elizabeth Riggs is far better character, but still...I was glad my favorite fictional golden retriever Baker was back. It was great to meet Hank Sweeney too. McGrory's work is at times light and funny--Flynn is a great alter ego. The bigger mystery is still a bit nutty and unrealistic, but fascinating all the rest.

Can't believe how bad this game is. Weak sauce in a can.. What's wrong with Spore? Terrible game for many reasons mentioned below.1) evolution is pretty much pointless, like comments from other user.

Actually Criticizes Plato. To my surprise, the author expresses strongly negative opinions towards some of Plato's conclusions, while maintaining that Plato "asked the right questions."The author presents Plato as a proto-fascist. Plato's theories of the forms are muddled, and Aristotle was wise to clarify or dispense with them. Laws was a horrid work which formed an unfortunate ending to Plato's writings.I find the author's opinions to be eminently reasonable. His views represent a common-sense approach to Plato.

Good gameplay, terrible story. The graphics were great. The battle system was different than most RPGs, but it was ok. The gameplay was pretty good (like camera angles, manuverability, ect.) But there were a lot of things I didn't like. The story line started out ok but got really boring and was kinda stupid as it progressed. And the end was terrible. The 30 mins or so it took to watch it could have been much better spent doing ANYTHING else. I also didn't like the method for upgrading weapons. You had to recruit people to make stuff, make certain items and then add it your weapon. But they never made anything all that great for me (and I spent many hours trying).

the journey and not the destination. I found this book to be wholly and completely engaging. While it's true that Murakami does leave many, in fact, dozens of questions unanswered, I believe the beauty of his book is in the journey and not the destination of the story. Toru is clearly overwhelmed by the ambiguity of both his situation and the people he meets. He searches for something "concrete" that he can wrap his head around. But he learns, as do we, that one can't always understand what's happening, or why it is. Sometimes you just have to go along, and hope for the best. It becomes a matter of faith.$LABEL$1,0,-100
poor craftmanship. I loved this vacuum until it started to fall apart. It began with the very short cord getting stuck and then frayed. That was wrapped with electrical tape. Then the hose tore at the point of entry to the canister. Again we used electrical tape to hold it together. Finally, the hose tore at the other end and out comes the electrical tape again. Instead of a 2 year vacuum, it looks like a 10 year vacuum. It also flips over easily and the attachments fall out and we lost one. Soo, I guess the moral of the story is don't get a Bosch vacuum!! Also, it was overpriced for the quality and forget about the service!$LABEL$0,0,-100

I really liked it when I first for it other than it is kind of loud, hard to get use to at first.After just a year I had to replace the lamp which is between 100-200 dollars, not in when it just goes out and you have to scramble around to find it and have to order online, when you only have 1 TV it's a bummer.Now for the worse part... A few months ago I noticed a little white dot on the screen for someone with a little case of OCD it drives you nuts, BUT...

Don't Buy it. I bought Ghost after my disk drive in my Dell computer began to fail. I followed Symantec's instructions 3 times to image a bootable new drive with no avail. Files were copied, but the drive would not boot. Finally, I got a free software download from the manufacturer of the new drive (Western Digital)and it worked fine. After booting up with the new drive, all programs worked except, you guessed it, all of Norton's stuff, the antivirus, internet security, etc... The kicker is that their suggestion was now to uninstall their software and re-install it again. But the software would not uninstall (including Ghost). The funny part is that their site recommends uninstalling all their software before doing a migration, including Gohst!

Very ordinary. I've just finished The Regulators and just starting Desperation. If it weren't for the great reviews of Desperation I would have got something else - but I thought the story was reasonable, just badly constructed.The idea that the whole thing (430 pages) takes place in a few houses in the one street in one afternoon/night reminds me of Geralds Game, and that was fairly poor also.The main story (people hiding from maniacs in vans) is very boring. However it is the 'underlying' story of a force that has become part of and taken over a young autistic child that kept me going - even this was boring at times.If you want horror read Salems Lot or The Shining, if you want a brilliant story read It or The Stand or The Green Mile.I just hope Desperation is better.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Doesn't look like a "woman's" watch. I ordered this through the seller "Just Brands" on Amazon, and in person the watch is actually much more chunky and masculine than the picture. I attempted to return it and Just Brands was the worst company I've ever had to deal with. They were impossible to get a hold of in order to get an authorization number to return the watch.

Great Movie--Disapponting DVD. This is perhaps one of the greatest music-themed movies ever made. You will find yourself spellbound at the talent and energy these first-time actors bring to this film. Lead singer Andrew Strong was only sixteen years old when this film was made, yet he has a voice which sounds like its seen a world of pain. Twentieth Century Fox has taken a diamond and smashed it to bits by not offering this DVD in a widescreen format (with DTS stereo). It could be a reference DVD if done properly. Maybe the Criterion folks will do it. Until then, don't bother with the full-screen version.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A TRUE LOSS OF FAITH.. Faith Hathaway had just graduated High School and was one week away from going into the army. She was full of hope and life. Robert Willie( the man this movie was based on), along with his accomplice raped and murdered her. She was raped, stabbed 17 times, and raped after she died. The director of this movie denied requests made by Faith's mother, and gave all the attention to the only person who deserved to die. Where was the mercy for Faith? Where was the compassion for Faith? Where were the people protesting for Faith's life? Finally where was the story about the mercy which was denied to Faith? What about her suffering and that of her family? Barely a foot note in this movie. Ohh and Sister Prejean has been discovered to lie when it suits her case.$LABEL$0,0,-100

well rounded reference...... As time is of the essence while travelling, I wanted to make the most of my time on the islands. This book allowed me to explore and choose a hike that was perfect for the length of my stay. I felt comfortable with the route laid out on paper. I was dissatisfied with THE BUS route and scheduling on Oahu as compared to the simple statement under how to get there. I had to explore a different route and connection but felt that THE BUS system was to blame. Otherwise, I felt that the book did sufficiently lead to the perfect hike for me at the time. The trail was beautiful and I look forward to using the book again down the road.$LABEL$1,0,-100

I'm a Marine in the United states. (This show is awesome). Not many shows (let alone cartoons) have the quality that avatar has brought. I'm never let down when a new episode. Some are not as epic as others but altogether it is a show that never disappoints. Values are instilled, humor is involved, and an adventure is brought that would give any child a more active imagination. I leave the show each episode somehow more relaxed and at peace. This show is a DEFINATE.

Adjustment Not So Bad. Although the previous review is correct in that there is a 'gap' between the last bead and the handle, I would not have noticed it without having it pointed out to me.On the other hand the rope is quite easy to adjust because of that 'feature'. In reading reviews of other jump ropes on Amazon it seems to me that this one is probably better than most when it comes to adjustment.As far as functionality it works fine, I wish I could jump rope better, but that's my problem (!)If color is important I will note that I thought it would be yellow and black as the illustration on the website, but it turned out to be gray and black. A pretty dull color combo.Looks like you can get a choice of color if you pick the ones that come direct from the mfgr but then you have to pay shipping, mine came thru Amazon Prime.Who would have thought there would be so much to say about a jump rope?P.S.

It's pretty awful.. Stephen Baldwin is a horror writer who discovers he has an identical, murderous clone. This silly Dean Koontz adaptation is based off of his equally silly novel, so it's no surprise the script has all the typical Koontz plot elements: Government conspiracy, heroes going on the run, and a final fight in the middle of nowhere. The only difference is that the mystery is revealed at the beginning! Overlong miniseries (Which actually features nudity in the video version)features countless leapholes in logic, unconvincing special effects, and a hilariously wooden Stephen Baldwin as the writer and killer. You can count the number of good Koontz novels and movies on one hand (Phantoms, anyone?), and this sure as hell isn't one of them.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Possibly Shallower than its Subject.. This is a very poor book. It has almost nothing to do with Las Vegas at all. It centers on porn stars and the porn industry, and the people profiled are most vapid and boring along with being incapable of reflection. The narrator's inability to make note of their deficient qualities and provide any sort of insight is its real flaw; however, as Sheehan appears incapable of judging anything or anybody which is indicative of many an academic nowadays. These types concentrate on being "tolerant" and "non-judgmental" which results in their having nothing to say. Porn is a means to an end for most guys. It isn't intriguing or meaningful. It's something in lieu of something else. If you enjoy reading about Las Vegas, I'd advise you to look at other titles.$LABEL$0,0,-100
remixes came too late to save the song. First of all, like my title says, these remixes came to late for the club crowd. But, if you like Willa you'll be intrested anyway:1. Mike Rizzo Club Mix (6.39): Love this mix it speeds up the chorus vocals but keeps the verse vocals at almost regular speed. Really cool beat. Best mix in my opinion.2. Sal Parm {of Plasmic Honey}Club Mix (9.14): Sal doesn't do a very good job. The track is cool but the vocals are way too slow for the bpm (beats per minute). Same goes for his radio edit.3. Mike Rizzo Hyper Vocal Mix (6.09): Hyper vocal indeed. If I didn't know the words to this song by memory I wouldn't be able to understand the verses in this mix. They just go by too fast.4. Sal Parm Dub (7.14): Very, very disappointing. Usually, even when the mix is bad, remix artists have a chance to redeem themselves on their dub but not Sal Parm. I really expected better mixes form him.5. Sal Parm Radio Edit (3.59): See Track 2I'd give 3 stars but the mixes were too late.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great book. I'm obsessed with Shaker furnitue and architecture. I'll get around to reviewing all of my books in time. I think I have every Shaker book printed!This one isn't "Complete" but there's an aweful lot in here. I look at "complete" more or less as meaning "most" variety of furniture. I didn't take it literally.This is one book that gives a lot of weight to Shaker built-ins as well. Of which I'm trying to re-create so I've been referencing this book a lot lately.I do have other books, some of which focus more on details and drawings with potential variety in drawer configurations for example, others more on color and simple photos etc.So far it 's been one of my favorites in terms of the wide variety of material it contains.

"White Ladder" Nothing Remarkable. Wow. It's rare to see an album rated a clean 5 stars across the board, and for that reason alone I was willing to give this record a listen. Add to that the facts that I love the song "Babylon" and that Dave Matthews, whom I respect, claims to have listened to this record almost exclusivly for months. Armed with that information, I was prepared for a record that would sit at the top of my collection for a good, long time.Ho-hum. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. Perhaps it's just the hyperbolic whiplash inherent in overexpectation. Perhaps it's that David Gray writes lyrically mediocre songs then records them with undistinguished musical backing. Perhaps it's his grating voice, which works well on a single song, but annoys on an entire CD.I won't dispute the hundreds of other reviewers here and elsewhere who loved this album unquestionably. I'll just assume that I'm missing something and move on.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Not sure about this one.... I am new to java but not to programming, so maybe this wasn't the book for me. While the style is new and innovative, I eventually got worn down by the constant humor, margin notes, and bizarre analogies. I also found that trying to use this book as a reference was nearly impossible. When the book did have a clear answer to what I was looking for, it was buried in the same quagmire I mentioned above.I suppose that if you are completely new to writing any form of code, this may be the right book for you. I would tend to think, however, that you will quickly grow out of it, and then its use as a reference later will hardly justify the space on your shelf. As an alternative, I would suggest "Learning Java" 2nd Edition (also published by O'Reilly).$LABEL$0,0,-100
Gets worse with each passing minute.. Charlize Theron is a concerned wife who believes her astronaut husband (Johnny Depp) isn't quite himself after a mysterious accident in outer space.

Gratuitous obcenity and (very) soft porn. A confusing silly mishmash of soft porn and filthy language topped off with a raving Dennis Hopper, who during a long period in his career appeared in a number of stinkers, apparently to pay the rent.There is nothing of any artistic merit in this travesty of moviemaking - the editing, direction, story, music, photography and acting are all ludicrous and repellent, without exception. Matthew Modine, in his excessive kissing scenes seems to be wanting to prove something...if you make it past the early scene, I suppose you can survive the rest of the movie.Well maybe there is one exception - Claudia Schiffer IS a sweetie and she deserved a better vehicle in her first major film role; she's tolerably competent and nice to look at. Unfortunately, her character is brutalized and abused for caring, and somehow she always comes back for more; maybe she's a masochist.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Utterly boring. I really looked forward to what the great Herbie Hancock would do with such cream-of-the-crop vocalists and musicians.The answer - absolutely nothing. No doubt you'll find such a declaration hard to believe, but go ahead and waste your time listening to this total flop, right across the board. There's just nothing here, nothing new, nothing interesting.Take the Santana track for example. Sounds completely and uniquely Sanatana, just like you've heard a hundred times before.Sting warps his voice at the start of his song, then settles back into the usual Sting sound - but it's all been heard before, so why would anyone want this?I was most looking forward to what Christina would do with her song, and I found out - taking it in every direction except one that makes sense.This is a product put out by people who think the public is stupid, and will eat up anything.Better off getting the best albums by the individual artists (eg.

Elegant design and functional, when it worked.. I recently purchased this palm for my mother who was interested in getting a new PDA. While the device itself worked perfectly, there was one major problem we seemed to have with it. The device itself seemed to stop turning on after a while. We had purchased the store's extended warranty so we just took it back and they replaced it. Second one, the same thing happened again. So we tried fiddling around with the battery, apparently the battery easily loses it's connection so the unit itself will not power on unless you fiddle with the battery. Two PDA's in a row with the same exact problem, and another reviewer encountered something similar, I think it's fair to say the initial release batch of this PDA has definitely had some issues. We ended up exchanging it for a Palm TX.My mother said she loved it while it worked, and is very disappointed such a trivial problem can cause so much annoyance.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Mad Dog and Glory. If this movie did not have Robert DeNiro and Bill Murray in it, you probably wouldn't finish watching it. It's hard to understand how someone would have read the script or seen the rough cut and said "people are going to come see this." The plot is standard-issue "man falls in love with hooker with heart of gold and has to save her from the mafia" stuff.

However, when I got the one I just recently ordered, I was sad to discover that the product design has slightly changed and almost makes the toy unusable. There used to be a rubber ring that sat in the holes to keep the pegs firmly stable so you can "pound the pegs" but they new design has a very loose ring and the pegs barely stay in the main wood frame. They fall out so easily, there's really no pounding of the pegs that gets to be done as the pegs basically just fall through the holes.$LABEL$0,0,-100

For those who love Heroes III. Actually 3.5 *. Armageddons Blade doesn't include that much new things, but the Elemental town is funny, though it is shame that the concept of all 7th level creatures growing at 1 per week (basic) i abandoned - phoenix grows at 2 per week (4 with castle), which is too great an advantage, even though it is somewhat weaker than the other 7th level creatures. The new neutral dragons are terribly (too?) expensive, even though they are awfully strong. I wonder, if they ever will be of that much use. Anyway, if you liked Heroes III, this is an excellent way of trying new scenarios and campaigns. I miss some new spells, artifacts (there are two new relic artifacts, though) and some modified secondary skills (too many of them stinks!), though.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A Rhino Dissapointment-Very Incomplete. What I have come to expect of Rhino is thoroughness, and this CD certainly is not thorough, although what is here is of course done very well. Where are the hits Half the Way,Why have you left the one you left me for, etc?

So strange, so good. What I enjoyed most about his book was how the story flowed, and how the author turned a true story into a very enjoyable novel.What's truly remarkable about this book, aside from the strange and chilling story, is the characters, and how the author manages to weave them in and out of the narrative. It works to perfection, leaving the reader with strong emotions towards the major figures in this case. The authors ability to get behind the scenes, including his use of the actual police files from 1982, gives us delicious new details about Durst and the case, and leads us up to the murders of Susan Berman in 2000 and Morris Black in 2001. Add in the political machinations, particulary the questionable-at-best actions of the Westchester, NY district attorney, and you have one heck of a story. The Durst trial for the Black murder is next spring, and anyone even remotely interested in this case must read this thoroughly engrossing book.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Forgettable.... Not the best revival, and certainly not the best overall. I don't remember much except that Tyne Daly, despite clear devotion to the role, has a voice that, to my ears, sounds weak, forced and occasionally off-key. Supporting cast members are so-so. This must be a very difficult role to sing, as even Roberta Peters falls flat (despite some exceptionally interesting interpretation). In my opinion, Patty Lupone's rendition is the best of the recent revivals, but Ethel Merman is still "The Mama" (after all these years)...$LABEL$0,0,-100

Overrated. There are several issues I have with this book:--This book should come with a large, bold, underlined disclaimer that it is not for victims of abuse. Only too late in the book does the author make this point. Being abused is not your fault; you are not "asking" for it.--This book did not encourage me to improve myself. Instead, I felt like it was almost hopeless to try to improve, because it was so complicated!--Also, this book claims to not fall in the trap of all the "self-..." books, however, it is obsessed with "self-deception". If it truly was not a "self-..." book it would have placed a larger emphasis on losing yourself in service for others, instead of being consumed with reflections on your faults.If you wish to improve yourself without the complication, Gordon B. Hinckley's "Standing for Something" actually encourages realistic improvements and makes you feel that you have potential to be a great person.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Monster Bass Lines by Shandrleria Praematurus. Squire wrote a fist of progressive songs of the highest level, at the finest moment of the progressive-atlantic-LP era: the early seventies. The five tracks are just genius. "Silently Falling" and "Lucky Seven" show the best moment of Bill Brufford at the drums. If this would be a Yes Album, it would be between the classics, like "Relayer" and "Close To The Edge"; but Chris wanted it to be done alone, with a little help from Mel, Patrick, Bill and Andrew.

Very confusing. Some might say that movies with little dialogue are interesting and artistic but I disagree. I was confused almost right from the get-go. I had no idea what was going on and I couldn't even figure out who the main characters were. The movie is kind of slow moving and a lot goes on but very little is explained. I wouldn't really suggest this movie unless you are one of those people who have laser-focused attention. I do not, especially when I'm at home. I do have to give props though, as the story is a very good idea.$LABEL$0,0,-100

not universal enough. Pros: sturdy, illuminated buttonsCons: those nice, sturdy, illuminated buttons don't do what I want. the pre-programmed codes were sufficient to get basic functions working on several devices (TV, VCR, receiver, DVD player), but when I tried to get this remote control to learn some other functions on my Denon AVR-3000 receiver and Sony XDR-F1HD tuner, it refused. I followed all of the tips in the owner's manual: I put new batteries in both remotes, I turned off the fluorescent lights, I moved the remotes closer and farther, I tapped the button instead of holding it, I stood on my head (just kidding). I tried dozens of times with no success. So I went to Radio Shack and bought the cheapest learning remote in the store (Radio Shack 7-in-1 Universal HD Remote Control); it learned those functions on the first try. I wish it had sturdy, illuminated buttons (it doesn't), but at least it works.$LABEL$0,0,-100
The real problem is.... Firstly, this movie does some things well. The introductions of most of the cast were reasonably good and the general plot began to develop quickly. As for the comic relief parts, some of the one-liners in this movies are better than the one-liners I've heard in most movies.The main problem this movie has is, once the main premise, ants attacking humans in an office building, is underway... the threat level never increases. As you'd expect, the body count rises, but in this movie, that is usually the result of the victim's actions.I think the writers should have spent more time trying to decide what actually happens when ants start attacking people. Aside from that, the only problem is that a central character debuts far too close to the end of the movie.It does have its good points, but ultimately, the main elements of the plot could have been handled better.$LABEL$0,0,-100

A Key Part of Virginia History. The VA Teachers Association was the Black teachers' organization in Virginia in the first half of the 20th century. It was central to the civil rights struggle in Virginia. This is an official history, but a lively and exciting one. If you want to understand what Black communities faced in the Jim Crow years, and the ingenuity and dignity with which they struggled, this is an excellent book to read. This organization no longer exists, having been integrated into the VA Education Association, so this book tells its entire history, from the early stages, taken at great risk, through the process of integration.$LABEL$1,0,-100

simple yet enjoyable stories of revenge.... Cornell Woolrich is one of those 1940s writers who pumped out loads of pulp fiction that have by now largely gone out of print. He was a very good storyteller but only an average writer - that is, his prose and characterizations are not particularly good. 'The Bride Wore Black' fits this rule completely.In 'The Bride Wore Black' we have essentially five different murder stories with one seemingly common element: the same murderess. In the end we understand a bit more about her motive and why these victims were chosen. Woolrich also delivers a delicious surprise ending. Don't expect any subplots or side romances. This is pure, simple reading enjoyment that doesn't tax the brain but keeps your eyes glued to the pages.Bottom line: certainly among Woolrich's better books. Highly recommended.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Terrible.. It amazes me that for all of his pomp and "patriotism," Mr. Hannity cannot see that by eliminating liberalism (which he classifies as part of the "evil" we must be delivered from) he is advocating a Republic form of government. Unlike Sean, I believe it's ok for people to have different opinions -- one of them crazy "liberal" ideas -- but for someone who claims his love for America with such fervency, it's ironic that he so clearly resents the most integral aspect of democracy: more than one voice. He equates 50% of the American population as on par with terrorists at worst, as opposition at best...I would argue that someone who loves and understands this country knows that the left and right are part of a system of checks and balances created in order to avoid one party having absolute power -- not enemies with clearly defined agendas of good and evil.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Setup is a pain!. The instructions aren't quite clear in a few places--poor image views and very limited text that doesn't really tell you what or where. This lead me to install the front panel incorrectly, which is attached by VERY cheap plastic pins that cannot be removed without breaking them.Also, the ignition electrode has a wide flat connector which is supposed to attach to a round small wire connector. Guess what? flat pieces don't fit in round sockets! In trying to force the wire onto the connector, I broke the electrode. Cost to replace? US$12.94. The warranty does not cover parts damaged during setup.Keep in mind, I'm usually pretty good at these kind of projects. I've had no trouble building furniture, installing lights and ceiling fans, etc., so it's not like I'm incapable of following directions. Next time, I'll get a a different brand, if this is any indication of the "support" I can expect from do-it-yourself Char-Broil grills!$LABEL$0,0,-100

This is not Helmet. I love Helmet but this is not Helmet. I was looking so foward to the day that Helmet would finally put another album out and this was such a huge disappointment. Page tries to sing, much like James Hetfield of the now much watered down Metallica, and fails miserably like Hetfield. Since the rest of the original members aren't back I am not even sure why Page is calling the band Helmet. The anger and aggression of their previous efforts are soarly missed like the rest of the band.$LABEL$0,0,-100
High capacity, Looks Good, Kind of Pricey for a Black of Wood. I needed a larger wooden block for my Henckels collection since I expanded my knife set. It was amazing how expensive a large capacity slot knife block could get. I looked everywhere and saw that Amazon had the most reasonable price for $50 with free shipping and no tax. I'm happy since it compliments my knife set nicely. I'd recommend it to anyone interested who own a Henckels knife set; however, beware that your overpaying for something that probably costs $5 or less to make.$LABEL$1,0,-100
It's cheap, and it breaks. In spite of the poor reviews, I went out and bought one of these. It worked WONDERFULLY for the first month. And then one day, it just died. Sure, I'm the idiot that threw out the box and the receipt. I may open it and try to fix it. But it broke with zero abuse.Worse, the degree of amplification seemed uncorrelated with antenna performance. As long as it was on, it was working well enough. Except for the times (before it broke) when the cable seemed "loose" and the signal was fuzzy.Don't buy it. Even at the low cost, it's not worth it. Other antennae work just as well (I'm using rabbit ears right now and I'm getting 95% of what I got with this) and don't break.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Rabbit gets sticky after four years. The device works well mechanically. You should know that there is a coating on it that gives it a nice matte black finish & rubbery texture that feels good to hold for about 3 years. Then at about four to five years of age it turns sticky and will leave a black gunk on your hands; not good.I think a $40 corkscrew should last longer than four years. Buy a Screwpull or an all-metal corkscrew.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Good product. Nicely designed. Easy to install.. I bought this tach for my sons 97 civic DX (it didn't come with a tacho). Started looking out on ebay and these little babies were selling for about 35 bucks - so Amazon was a steal at 25 bucks with free shipping.Shipping: It arrived about 4 days later (kudo's to Amazon for super fast free shipping). Package was good - nothing damaged.First look: Opened the package and took it out. Came with the tach, instruction manual, and vehicle reference. Nothing complicated.Installation: This was a breeze. Went online to civic forums and they said the blue wire that my car already came with was the tach wire. Installation was so easy, took about 20 mins, I thought I did somethign wrong. I started the car up and the tach came to life. Have it mounted on the pillar to the left of the driver.Longevity: Been installed for at least a month now and no problems. Works great.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Ballsy Rock N Roll. This is a great CD. This was my first AC DC purchase a long time ago.. and I really must tell you that it rocks loud, but also it has a song on their that is just excellent..

Wow, this sucks.. Well I got this because it was my first guitar. I have to tell you straight up that this sucks. First of all the strings were way to crappy. Like made out of plastic, and they were way to hard to tune. If you tune this it comes out of tune in no time. The case rips very easy and the strap breaks easy as well. The pick's are very bad, they are way to big. The extra strings are no better then the ones of there. I have bought another guitar from Guitar Center and it was amazing. Worked perfectly and it was cheap too. If you want my advice, save up and buy a good one from Guitar Center, because this is crap.$LABEL$0,0,-100

"Autobots, Transform and Roll Out!!!". Rhino has finally come through with a proper DVD release of one of the greatest cartoons of all time, The Transformers. Here you have the first 16 episodes on three discs, plus a forth disc of extras. The discs come packaged in a terrific looking silver case. Unfortunately, getting the discs OUT of said case is quite a challenge...to say the least. But once you do, you will be blown away by the excellent picture and sound quality of these digitally-restored episodes. The colors are rich and vibrant; the dialogue and background music crystal clear; the many laser shots and explosions ROCK! The extras are exceptional as well - especially the clips from the Japanese version of the show. This set is definitely a MUST BUY for any animation fan. ...So, Rhino, when will Season 2 be available? ...And how about G.I. Joe? ...He-Man?? ...ThunderCats???...$LABEL$1,0,-100
One of the most helpful self-help books I've ever read.

Product expired two years ago!!!!. I ordered Phos-Flur about two months ago and I was quite satisfied with the product. Since I moved to an area where water is not fluoridated, everyone at my family started having cavities, some of them for the firts time in their lifes.Sadly, I placed the next order from John Alexander Upperman through Amazon, and this order came in a different bottle, tasted different, and more importantly IT IS FROM A LOT THAT EXPIRED IN 2010!!!Being this a health product intended to be put in one's mouth, selling a product that's expired years ago is dangerously irresponsible. I used it a couple times before noticing the expiration date, I hope it doesn't have any adverse effects in my health. At the very least, it is likely not to be too effective given how quickly the active ingredients react.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Junk Electronic Speed Control. Hi,When it is working, this appliance is great, but in the last 3 years, I had to replace the electronic speed control three times. The funny thing is that KitchenAid, doesn't even carry it as a spare part, (I guess they would rather sell you a new mixer all over again :) )The first time, I really did scramble to find one from a third party and it cost me U$ 67.00 with shipping.Speed control #2 did last a little less than a year and I just had to replace it again.This last year, my wife used the mixer maybe 5 times. This time, I got speed control #3through Amazon.com for U$ 38.00.The electronic on this mixer is made from the cheapest components money can buy; it seems to degrade slowly by itself even if it isn't being used.....It is a far cry from the rugged unit KitchenAid is marketing. Good news; 2 years after installing unit #3 our mixer is still going...$LABEL$0,0,-100

What a disappointment. What I thought was a book on the history, food, and culture was infact a book on the intricate details on the mafia... This book is a diservice to the already narrow-minded people who think only of mafia when they think of Sicily. I want to learn what makes Sicily what it is. I was even more disappointed that the mafia wasn't left out of the art scene. The author has done his research on the history on the mafia, but if I wanted a book on the mafia I would have gotten one.

Not sure.... I'm about 100 pages in and I can't decide whether to keep reading or not. I was really expecting to be totally enthralled with this book as a result of the description and the reviews but so far, I can't get connected to the story or the characters. I find the concept of the book fascinating but ultimately, I don't find the characters engaging and in some ways it all seems superficial or contrived to me. At the same time, I keep believing that if I stick it out a little longer, I will find it more compelling and that I might miss out on a good book if I give up. My philosophy has always been that I would rather walk away from a book I'm not enjoying or gaining anything from in favor of others that I would find more satisfying. With this one, I'm very torn. I think I may ultimately move on to something else. That being said, if the description interests you, I would recommend giving it a chance; maybe it will speak to you more than it has to me.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Happy Camper. Set up was as easy as promised. And it does what I want it to do which is to store mostly graphic files as well as Photoshop Elements. The only problem I've had is setting up a filing system that makes sense to me.

Even though I've complained for years about how MS Windows has set up the file system on my hard drive, at least it was a system. Other than that, it's been great to have and moving large files over to it has made my C Drive work more quickly. I'm still learning, so I'm sure that I'd have more things to say as I work with it some more$LABEL$1,0,-100

Disappointment Compared to the First Two. I totally agree with "Barry" a previous reviewer who nailed this on the head. The original Carol and Mike Brady actors from the first two film saves this from sinking like a lead pipe. The girl who plays Marcia is good, Jan ok, but the other children are completely mis-cast. The actor who plays Greg acts and looks more like Peter. Peter and Bobby simply share no resemblance to the true characters and have few cameos because of it. I thought the first part of the movie was confused and strained. Better plots are available. Some of the original series plots are brought forth, but never really captitalized on, except for the "slumber party" which was well done. This attempts to be as funny and comedic as the first two films, but fall short in depth and cleverness. Fans will want to see it...but take my advice and rent.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Ronnie Baker Brooks - Great Debut Album. Ronnie is the son of Chicago blues legend Lonnie Brooks and "Golddigger" was his debut album. If you like fiery blues guitar with more than a hint of Hendrix this album should appeal to you. Brooks' father and Chicago mainstay Jellybean Johnson both make guest appearances here as well. Brooks mixes traditional blues with a little funk, some soul and a good dose of rock to make a modern blues album in the Chicago tradition. Brooks is a fantastic guitarist and a solid vocalist and with songs like "She's A Golddigger" and "Stuck On Stupid" it is clear that his songwriting chops are top notch as well. For a debut disc, this one is very good and should appeal to anyone who enjoys modern guitar based blues.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The story of movie maker Jean Casson, hedonist Parisian playboy, and his struggles to live and survive while his world collapses is intriguing and whole engaging, the only lapse is the story doesn't have a strong plot, it wanders and then ends... c'est la vie.$LABEL$1,0,-100
great product. against advice the FIRST battery tender I purchased was from a local place and the reviews were not so great but being impatient I bought it and paid the price of not buying the best. 2 months later the product stopped working and another dead battery. Even when it did work, the car sounded like it wasn't getting fully juiced on start. So i finally ordered the Del-Tran Plus, hooked up to a dead car to see what the hype was about. The next day the car fired right up and sounded like a brand new car, not a 10 year old garage kept ride. I have been nothing but impressed and would highly recommend it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Come Again?. I'm a real Bond fan. Seen every one ever made and have all of them in my collection. I like Brosnan and the Bond Babes. But, yes but. This movie just seemed lame. The bad guys were really bad but not very believable. The special effects were special but not that special. An ice hotel? Dueling super cars? Trans-morphic DNA cloning? Bond getting caught? Give me a break. Never happen. The producers and director seem to be losing the magic formula and trying to make up for it with flash and glitz. I hate to say it but you can skip this one unless you are really bored.$LABEL$0,0,-100
total Dream Theater ripoffs. It is not unfair to compare this album to Dream Theater, because it is entirely and completely a ripoff of the "Images and Words" sound. If all those tired generic progmetal tricks still turn you on, maybe this album will be OK for you. But in my view there is much more important stuff on this planet: Arcturus, Opeth, Nevermore, Mekong Delta, Therion,... Dream Theater themselves for that matter.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Love it!!. We bought this gate a few weeks ago because I am 9 months pregnant and have a large chocolate lab that I do not want going into the baby room. However, I did not want the door to be shut all the time either. So we got this gate because I wanted something I could easily get in and out of without the hassle. This gate is great!! It was really easy to install and it looks great as well because of the clear sidings, it doesn't take away from the room at all. I also have a 2 1/2 year old stepdaughter who has not managed to get in or out of the gate, even with a little push. So I am fully confident that this gate will do the trick. I highly recommend.I only gave four stars because we haven't had the baby yet, but I do not anticipate it getting worse...only better!$LABEL$1,0,-100

Epic.. This is the most recent DVD release of this film. The picture has been restored to a spectacular crispness so, you don't need to worry about missing anything. The film itself is on the first 2 discs, while the third one has some cool bonus stuff. There is also a booklet, which has a short chronicle of the filming process and the last documented interview with Toshiro Mifune. There is no English dubbing, just subtitles but, that's how it should be. I am glad this film is in such good condition because, as Kurosawa said "It is wonderful to create".$LABEL$1,0,-100
He went out on a high note.. I enjoy these two discs for much of the same reasons that I prefer Billie Holiday's later music. Sure, both of their voices had lost what range they had once possessed. Yes, their voices cracked and were off key much of the time; victims of the addictions which eventually claimed both of their lives. But like Billie, Chet Baker's voice developed an emotional level which often bordered on the scary. Just listen to him on the two versions of "My Funny Valentine" presented here, and see if you don't find yourself wiping away a few tears. Mr. Baker's trumpet playing, however, never seemed to fall victim to his addictions. If anything, its beauty only continued to bloom. The concert presented here was recorded only 2 weeks before the artists death and features the wonderful NDR Big Band and Radio Orchestra Hanover. For the pure emotional impact of the music, I highly recommend these discs.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Do Not Buy This Version of Metropolis. This is a great movie that Hollywood Classics has done the dis-service of putting out in their collection of DVD's. Sadly, this was my first time seeing the film from beginning to end, and I couldn't do it. The transfer is from a tape (a poor one, at that), the sound is garbled, and is too painful to watch with the lousy video quality. Hopefully, Criterion will do it right.

Lucy: Very Funny Episodes. These episodes are sooooo funny. You will fully enjoy these.The first Lucy is really funny. In "Lucy is Envious," Lucy's wealthy school mate, Cynthia Hardcourt, is working in town. Lucy lies about that she gives a lot to charity and gets herself in a jam. She has to get 500 dollars! She is paid to work as martians from outer space. They get get 500 dollars, but Ricky and Fred pose as martians as well to scare Lucy and Ethel. The second episode, "Lucy Tells the Truth," is when Ricky makes a bet that Lucy cannot tell the absolute truth for 24 hours. Lucy is forced to not fib and makes it, barely, after Ricky gives in.Get these episodes. They are worthy of five stars.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Problematic, Offensive Film. Stylistically this film was interesting. HOWEVER. This film is seriously problematic in its portrayal of a trans woman. I didn't even buy that Veronica was trans. Her identity seemed based around clothing and surgery as opposed to an actual gender identity. One reviewer talks about this being an accurate portrayal of a trans woman or representative of the trans experience? As someone who is trans and has many trans* friends, I have to strongly disagree. This film manages to hit every unrealistic stereotype about trans women. I wonder if anyone involved in the making of this film was even queer.$LABEL$0,0,-100
I've never had luck with Sony products.... There's little I can tell about the 818LP because my set...broke down after roughly 2 months of use.Other than that, I think that in terms of sound, they're worth the price but for a price just a bit higher you can get the Koss Spark Plug earbuds which outperform the Sony 818LP in ALL ASPECTS. The foam covers are not only difficult to put on, they fall off in an instant, mine lasted one week and one has gone missing, making the other one useless as there is no spare set included.Generally, I'm very disappointed with these earbuds, I expected more from Sony...MUCH MORE, but - just because of their sound - I give them 2 stars...$LABEL$0,0,-100
Works great.. I bought this Wii Wireless Sensor Bar because my cat chewed through the wire on the sensor bar that came with the Wii. This one runs on batteries, but at least there isn't a wire for the cat to chew. There is a timer you can set so the bar doesn't stay on and using up the batteries when you're not using it. One night my husband played the Wii before bed and after we'd turned out the lights and gone to sleep the alarm on the sensor bar went off - it was loud enough to wake us up and the Wii is in a different floor of the house than our bedroom. So turn that off when you're done if you don't want the alarm going off.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Another warning - avoid this purchase - wasted money.. Well, I thought I'd purchase this CD collection in hopes of learning much more about contracting... Problem is, most of the data on these CD's are way outdated (2003), so more than likely when you click on a link in the pdf files you'll come up with a dead link. quite frustrating. Another issue that bothered me was that the data DOES (as the previous reviewer mentioned) is simply provide screen shots to government websites.

Great book if you like touching stories, needs a larger sign dictionary. I started out with this book when my daughter was about 6 months.

Excellent. I had forgotten just how good Pat Benatar was, and this album reminded me. I never bought a Pat Benatar album before, but had enjoyed many of her songs growing up and when i saw this compilation, I got it, and have listened to it several times since.You can see and listen to the play list up at the top, so I won't talk about that, suffice to say that all of her top 40 singles are on the album. There is also a brief history of her life which I found interesting to read, including her first husband (which is how she got the name Benetar), and the fact her monther was an opera singer.The other thing I took away from this album is a much greater appreciation for her talent. The woman really could sing, in stark contrast to a lot of the acts of the '80s that were all image. This performer had talent and I am glad I am finally able to recognize it.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Stunning. I had a pear shaped .41 ct Diamond placed in this setting over a year ago. I wanted a ring that stood out from the rest and had a little color to it. I get compliments all the time and I could not be more happy with my beautiful ring. When I am bored, waiting for appointments and such, I sit and watch the light play off the Sapphires and Diamond.

great pulley. heavy duty, and very smooth. I bought a pair of these to hang from my celing in the garage to hang weights from for doing lat pulldowns, triceps, etc. my only complaint is that it is hard to get the pin back into its hole after removing the wheel from the housing to put your rope or cable through. i ended up putting it in a vice to hold it together while i got the pin through, but that is the last time i will have to do that, so not really a problem for me.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Mindnumbingly Boring!. I too picked up this book partially because of the King quote and what sounded like an interesting plot. Boy, was I dissapointed. 4 vacationing Americans make friends with a group of foreigners and on a whim decide to help find one of the group's missing brother who left on a supposed dig on "ruins" in the middle of the jungle, but has yet to return. What follows is page after page of whining and stupidity. I actually hated all the American characters, who barely have enough brain power between them all to walk up-right. The Greeks they meet are actually creepy. The only person I liked was Mathias. Midway through the book I was praying for someone/something to just kill them all already so I didn't have to hear any more complaining or stupid ideas. Horrible plot, way too slow, characters no one should like and the most intense part for me was trying to finish the book so I could move on to something worth my time and the paper it's printed on.

Best Lord of the Rings game. Everyone who played the Two Towers yearned for 2 player longer levels and more characters, and EA happily responded. First the graphics are pretty darn good, except the in-game characters' mouths don't move, but that's my only nitpick with the graphics. The sound is spectacular, exactly from the movies, which is pretty cool, and the voice acting is great with the actors from the trilogy lending their voices(watch "Hobbits on gaming." It's downright hilarious!). Controls are precisely lifted from The Two Towers, not that it's a bad thing. My only complaint with this is that even with 15 levels, it's a tad too short, enemies can stop your combos way too easily, game can get intense and hard, even on the easy difficulty. But they're only minor complaints. If you're a fan of the movies or books, you owe it to yourself to pick up The Return of the King. You won't be dissapointed.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Wow--Comfort Food at its Best. This is probably the best vegetarian cookbook I've ever had. The recipes are simple, Jackson's tone is conversational, and every time I pick up the book, I see something new. I've tried about a half-dozen recipes in this book, and they've all been fantastic. So far: overnight cinnamon rolls, dump cobbler, country ham tofu, fried chicken tofu, and the requisite gravies. There are so many more recipes that I want to try. Do note, though, that not all of these are "healthy"--many of them require good amounts of sesame oil and or margarine. But I don't care--what a great book. I've gotten it for family and friends, and my dad (yes, my dad!) even had second helpings of the country ham tofu. A keeper.$LABEL$1,0,-100

Isn't it NOT a pity ....... !!. Wow!! A tribute album to a band almost lost on the average listeners ears. 'Fragile' and 'Nukleopatra' were stunning DOA albums ... and it's been WAY TOO LONG since we've had something new to listen to. What 'JACK & JILL PARTY' lacked, 'Rocket' more than makes up for. Thumping beats, excellent choice of songs and many different production styles. Yes, some are high-fi (Astromill & Empire State Human) and others low fi (Audiodoll & Giallo) .. but this adds to the charm of the release. Well done to Section 44 ...

Did he go off the deep end?. First off, let me say that musically this CD has a few nice things to offer, which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one. But in addition to some of the hackneyed synth lines (which I won't go into since other reviewers have covered this well), he writes lines like: "Bullets for the brains of the atheists".So let me get this straight, Roland: Atheists should be KILLED???Is this some weird kind of Christian tough-love or has he simply gone insane? And there's no getting around this hateful line either: no one can claim this is somehow metaphorical because he precedes the line with "Hey now read my lips" and he then repeats it.Anyone who wants to spew hatred can do it without my financial support. I'm not even an atheist and this offends me deeply.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Best of Abbott & Costello Vol. 2. This is my family's second purchase of a volume in the series. We have been especially pleased with both of them. This one is wonderfully charming for us, because it contains several movies by Abbott and Costello that we had never seen before. And of course, since it contains the Naughty Nineties, You get the wonderful routine about who's on first. One of the things that we enjoy so much about these movies is that they are accessible to my nine-year-old daughter. She absolutely enjoys them and watches them over and over again. When you consider some of the things she could be watching on TV, the thought of her watching Abbott and Costello instead is absolutely thrilling.

Interesting begining.... but halfway through the book I found myself incredibly bored. As soon as her 'romance' began I just lost interest. The farther I got, the less I connected with the protagonist. All of my favorite characters disappeared.

Worked great.. They fit just fine on my 20 year old Schwinn Moab. The V-Brakes that came with the bike were wearing out after 20,000 plus miles. The inset shaft is shorter on these than my originals, so they do not sit quite flush with the frame (hard to describe really), but it is just an asthetic's issue. Funtionally, they work perfectly. It seemed faster and easier (and not much more expensive) to replace the entire brake system that it has been to just replace the pads.

Pure Slumdog Stuff. The writer is re-telling Harry Potter a.k.a Lord Rama - that too very badly. I can't believe how this piece of pure trash got published. From what I glean from this pure garbage; the writer seems to have been inspired by Harry Potter ( Lord Rama), Barbara Cartland ( check out the love scene between King Dasaratha and his long-forgotten first wife for a good laugh) and Rapunzel ( Sita ) and not by any measure, the great Indian Epic Ramayana. The Book is a monumental mouse.BTW, the person the writer calls Demon King, that is Lord Ravana, is revered as a God in some parts of India till date. I sorta like this this chap ( Ravana, not the writer) myself! Ramayana is slightly more complex than a straight-forward fight between good and bad, it is layered and most importantly, a great leveler.Hi Amazon,Can I give this book a Zero?Cheers to Everyone ( except the writer, of course)$LABEL$0,0,-100
what crap!. the only "secret" is that there is no secret. this book is a marketing ploy-plain and simple. do not contribute to the author's bank account, save your money, and, work hard and honestly for what you need- that's "THE SECRET". the book, the author, and her supporters say nothing new, nothing with originality, and, nothing that is truly proven. it is however, very nice kindling for my fire.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Floats. These pellets float around on top until they get caught up in enough current from a powerhead to get pushed under. Specifically wanted a sinking pellet, I would not buy again. My fish seem to like it, some just don't get much to eat because they are too skitish or its against thier nature, to eat from the surface.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Good Plot Amateurishly Written. Roby has an interesting plot line, although it leans toward the predictable and sometimes turns preachy. Still, it's a good story with a logical plot and a significant message. Mrs. Roby has the potential to be a terrific writer, but she needs to develop her craft to reach beyond the amateur technique, sentence construction, and punctuation errors that plague her novel and distract from her story. Her natural ability provides a good outline, but her lack of knowledge in the art of telling a good story well proves to be a crippling flaw. In an interview with Mrs. Roby, she proudly said she had never attended a writing course or worked with a writing group. Investing herself in such opportunities for critique would polish her natural ability and challenge her to strive for excellence and craftsmanship. With the odds she's beaten already, what is there to fear from an opportunity to sharpen her skills?$LABEL$0,0,-100
Wasn't comfortable. This just did not do the trick for me. I'm 5'2", so I thought the mini snoogle would be better for me. I really didn't like anything about it. The top part is uncomfortable to use as a pillow, which is one way it is shown for usage. I have tried bending it all sorts of different ways, and just none are comfortable. It doesn't contour to my body well at all. I wound up getting a regular body pillow and am happier with that.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Worst of the films to die for. The worst of the set 'GraveDancers' there was not one likable character in this one I didn't care about any of them, I wanted all of them to die, and it contained overblown special effects that were stupid at the end. Big ghost head chasing in graveyard, wow that is dumb.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Good sound, poor build quality. I've been a Fender fan but recently purchased a Les Paul Studio Deluxe and love it. I like the shorter scale and wanted a less expensive guitar to haul around. I thought this was a great deal - an American made Gibson for $500. But the build quality is so poor I'm considering a return. The fret edges are sharp, and the pickups aren't even installed properly. They're wrapped in shoddy electrical tape and just kind of stuck in there. They move around a lot. It sounds OK, but the pickup selector seems very cheap too, and I'm worried it won't last. I don't mind the cosmetics much - stripped down to bare bones. But it looks like it's just thrown together with absolutely no concern for quality. It's the poorest assembly I've seen on any guitar at any price - except maybe those $100 kits you see in music stores. Not recommended. Try an Epiphone maybe.$LABEL$0,0,-100
What a great book!. I've never read a book like this before. Not only is it so funny you laugh out loud, but the scenes with the serial killer are so scary that I had to stop reading to make sure the doors were locked!This is a fast-paced and funny book, and I'm looking forward to the second book in the series. Jack Daniels is a great character.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Terrible. This is one of the worst CDs I have ever bought. There is nothing here to distinguish it from other R&B albums. It's cookie-cutter hip hop at its absolute worst. If you want to hear the song "Angel", then download the song and don't waste your money on this CD.$LABEL$0,0,-100
Great Car Seat, but very hard to tighten!!. I am really happy with this car seat and my 2 year old loves it as well!! I bought this car seat in store. I went in with another car seat in mind, but after talking to the sales man, who is a car seat inspector, he recommended this car seat to me. He said that this car seat is the only car seat that he recommends buying (at least the ones in store) that were a car seat/booster combo. This one was the only one that had the EPS (the stuff found in bike helmets). He said that it could be life saving in a side inpact accident.The only problem that I have with this car seat is that it is very hard to tighten. I pull the strap with all of my might and it feels like it is not going anywhere. It takes a while for me to tighten the straps everytime he gets in the car seat.If the straps were easier to tighten, then I would give it 5 stars!$LABEL$1,0,-100
CD is great, PBS show was great, look forward to DVD. As a friend of the Marsalis family for 24 years and the President of Basin Street Records (where drummer and youngest son Jason Marsalis has recorded two wonderful CDs, Music in Motion, and Year of the Drummer) I have seen members of the family in all sorts of configurations.Those of you in the dozen cities or so where the family will be performing this month and next should make sure you go out and check them out. Individually they are all great musicians...together they push each other to the top and have a lot of fun doing it.The CD is great, the PBS special last night was fun to watch and I am looking forward to the DVD.$LABEL$1,0,-100
A true reason why they were on sale. Bought these the day after Thanksgiving sale on Amazon for a great price of 30 dollars in comparison to the original price of over 130 dollars. Got headphones and was not impressed with the sound quality of these headphones. Very low bass and as it is noise cancelling, it also acts as a mini-speaker since it protects so loudly when off the ears. Also within 7 days, the right phone stopped working and I had to send off to Sony Service Center to get fixed. The good thing is that that was a very fast turnaround. Final thought, dont purchase if you are a true audiophile as you will be disappointed, even at the discounted price of 30 dollars. I have had 10 headphones I was happier with.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Great reference book.. This is a great english dictionary. The paid $48 edition includes appendixes. The free one on kindle for pc only includes the dictionary A to Z. I like the encyclopedic information under some entries. On my Kindle 2 there seems to be a formatting error at locations 801955-801964. At the start of appendix 1 countries of the world, some of the data looks messed up. Data for some of the countries is missing while other country data is repeated twice. But it looks correct on my kindle for pc. There are no formatting problems with this on kindle for pc.$LABEL$1,0,-100

An exciting experience. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud while reading. Michael Tenaglia is one funny writer. The warning on the cover was not true I was not offened by the sex or th violence.The bigest thing I came away with was a desire/fantasy to meet the writer for a late night drink. I mean one minute you're in the middle of a fistfight on a Manhattan street, the next minute your hearing a political rant that would make Dennis Miller jealous, and the next minute he says something so poetic you're stopped in your tracks. Somehow he makes you laugh through it all. Bravo!$LABEL$1,0,-100
Fairly Good, But Includes Factual Errors. I am only doing the pediatric section so far, but have discovered factual errors. For example, question 155 in the pediatric section: An infectious process that could cause meningitis would have which sign? You have to choose between headache and stiff neck, but either one of these could indicate meningitis. Consider question 205, which suggests that lymphocytic thyroiditis is temporary. No, only the subacute form is temporary, but they left out the word "subacute" -- otherwise it would be chronic, Hashimoto's disease.Another problem with the book is that the pages come out easily, with only slight pressure.But most of these NCLEX books do contain a lot of factual errors. I feel like they should hire me as an editor; the so-called editors for most of these books must be whiskey drinkers.It's a decent book, compared to the others. Not the best, but in the mid-range. I would buy it again, but double-check the answers to make sure they're correct.$LABEL$0,0,-100
No where near as good as the real shows. The real shows of this were far better. This is a butchered, sanitised, half-baked version despite the DVD claiming to be 20 minutes longer. Many of the performances are no where as powerful as prior efforts and some content is cut down to small portions of the prior pieces heard on DEMOCRACY NOW and found on YOUTUBE. Kilcher's reading of Chief Joseph is murdered on this DVD for a better version see the link on my website [...] links to a youtube from Sundance 2009.There are huge topics watered down or omitted by this presentation. Where is Haymarket ? Where is Alexander Berkman? Why is Ellsberg included ? So many other thoughts ran through my head watching this. Go to youtube watch Sandra Oh's performance of Emma Goldman on Patriotism so much more powerful than what seems like a rehearsal take on this DVD.$LABEL$0,0,-100

Plain, Simple, Boring. This book is filled with information. Information that is mainly useless. I usually read 60 pages a day reading about wine, but I always dreaded having to read 10 pages a day from this book. Everything is repeated over and over again. There is no pronunciation guide, so if you see an unusual word that you do not know how to say, you'll feel like your losing ground by not saying it right. The the main maps of Australia and New Zealand are somewhat decent, but the maps that they give for each region, for each chapter or section, are so detailed that there is no way you can reference where about they are in that specific region. Meaning they zoomed into roads, not cities (unlike French and Italian Wines for Dummies). To cut to the chase, the only positive thing I could come up with about this book, is that it is a rather large book and it would look good in your wine book shelf to impress friends. :)$LABEL$0,0,-100
Pretty good. When I started reading this book I thought it was going to be another epic story but it turned out to be pretty good. I like the way that Flewelling draws her world and the history behind it. Some of the characters such as Nysander and Alec are a bit predictable but I have hopes that the characters will develop through the trilogy.Flewelling keeps dropping hits about Seregil's past and we just want to learn more about it, doesn't always work for me, but it did this time.All in all a good and fun read.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Pop Confection Perfection. Of all the Beatle sound-alike artists I have ever heard, these guys take the cake. I could swear that's John Lennon on lead vocals and the melodies to "Vegetable Row", "Homefront Cameo" and "My Before And After" would make McCartney proud. This album plays like the missing link between Rubber Soul and Revolver. The band never really transcends their Beatle influence/obsession which is o.k with me. That's what we have Oasis for.$LABEL$1,0,-100

The legendary Slowhand. Although I prefer Clapton's earlier guitar driven works like "Stepping Out", "Hideaway", "Have You Heard" from the legendary "Beano" album and "Crossroads" from Cream, this album was what would become a stepping stone to his more laid-back experimental works like the classic "Slowhand" album. My favourite tracks included Big Bill Bronzy's "Key to th Highway" and Jimmie Cox's "Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out". A supreme transformation, true to Clapton's innovative improvisation. I was a bit dissapointed that "Blues Power" was not in the album but it won't do justice to the album if it did since this is a love album. This is an album for circa 70s Clapton's fan. An ultra-supreme album, well-deserved to be a classic of its genre and era.$LABEL$1,0,-100
Odious, odious, odious!. I had such high expectations for this book, I am so disappointed. I really didn't like anything about it. I read some really glowing reviews and was so excited to find a book that seemed like it was something I would love.I didn't care for the writing, the mystery, the characters, or the so-called love interest or romance portion of the story. In fact I thought the whole story was ridiculous. And the repetition of the word odious was very annoying.I so wished this had been something like Kate Ross's Julian Kestrel Mysteries which I loved. Sadly it was not at all like that and I wasn't able to find anything to love about this one.$LABEL$0,0,-100
