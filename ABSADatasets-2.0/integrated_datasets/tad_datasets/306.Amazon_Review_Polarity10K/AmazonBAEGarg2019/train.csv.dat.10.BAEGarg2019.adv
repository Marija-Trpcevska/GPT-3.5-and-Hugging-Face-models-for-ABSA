Rabbit Proof Fence. RABBIT PROOF FENCEThe movie was terrible!! It was suspenseful. You never knew what was going to happen next.The 3 aborigine girls were always being followed by the tracker. They were also helped alot by people that you never would of thought. For example a white person gave them food and coats.A white man helped them navigate which made the movie more exciting.I like this movie. I think people should watch it. I also think it is bad taking kids from their families this is why they called the thousands of Aborigine children taken away "The Stolen Generation.BY: ParisBordeaux5/14/04$LABEL$1,1,0

Disk was so scratched that we can appreciate the movie. We love the movie Ratatouille. We were sad when we noticed that the DVD was missing from our collection of movies so we decided to look at Amazon to get a copy. We looked at the used copies because the new ones are still @ $20. So we looked at the used ones. We found on that said Condition: Used - Good for $6.86. We ordered it. It came in when expected and with much anticipation we opened it so we could watch it that night, only to see an incredible amount of scratches on the disk. I was shocked. I could accept a couple, but it looked like it was on the floor of a car in the back seat for 6 months. We tried to watch it any way and got through 30 minutes with only a few pixelated moments and a couple stutters. Then it happened. It started stalling for 3 seconds, then 5 seconds then it froze. As far as rating the movie itself, I give it a 5 star! but the quality... I have ordered a lot from Amazon, I am very disappointing.$LABEL$0,1,1

considered aggrandizing. If there is a Donald Trump in the nanny business Ms. Kline would surely be hosting the next Apprentice show except that she does not seem to have the same gravitaz that Mr. Trump demonstrates. Name-dropping and full bragging of how important she is to the "over achieving" parents who are basically folks trying to integrate work and family lifestyles does not deny ms. Kline a likeable decent person. (Whether you agree with how the parents are spending their time or not)Instead of being empathetic, Ms. Kline comes across as a self-ordained I-am-a-very-important person in Washington. She brags about the fact she can choose you as a client and gets more important clients than she really cares for.The book is a quick easy read, but there is no substance and a lot of snide remarks on Ms. Kline's clients make her a character that any parent should stay away from.$LABEL$0,1,1

To Kill a Fruit Fly. 02/08/10Dear night:we cats recently picked up fleas from their cat. as over twenty years of cat ownership we now had a problem with fleas, as we exercise a very low protocol on contamination controlls.It was with an extended vet hospital setting that my cats had home "unwanted guests" FLEAS!!!which vet recommended [...] and flea traps to augment their capabilities. mark says the VICTOR FLEA TRAPS do not work!!! The best they do is to trap harmless fruit flies and some gnats.I still have a flea problem as I was lulled into thinking that my home was flea free by the fact that I did not trap any fleas and my cat had only pickedup a few fleas (My vet stated).Well the traps are useless!!! Scientifically I do not know why I did not realize that, I panicked to be free of the problem.Save your money and just use a vet approved topical flea med on your pets.Sincerely:MOLARMAMA$LABEL$0,1,1

Great comedians but not a great writing or script. I've seen these four in movies and TV s that have made me laugh till it hurt. Shockingly I did not laugh once at this movies. me can't blame the cast because if you want Tropic Thunder, 21 Jump street, The I.T. d wedding Crashers and then this film you will know what I'm talking about. "Spoiler" It is truly a story where aliens come to earth and they are killer monkeys. I wish they did it like 21 Jump Street and made the threat be distracted by the incompetent heroes and then busted. Also the aliens were ridiculous. I feel like someone or some people did not use the talent that was in this film for some odd reason. I thought there was great chemistry between Bed Stiller and Richard Ayoade and I hope they do another film again.$LABEL$0,1,1

Great until it dies. I bought this from Amazon on June 24th and it is now dead, a little less than 6 month later. You put a disc in and it just spins and spins and never loads. This DVD player was used nightly for several hours. A fantastic replacement considering the old DVD player I had lasted 7 years. If you're looking for something to replace in months, this is it. Otherwise I would spend a little more money on a super quality product. The RCA player I have downstairs has lasted longer than this one. I guess you get what you pay for.$LABEL$0,1,1

TALES FOR A JEWISH INDIAN. One of the strangest ideas of this book is Ed Eagle, who someone seems to think is a Native American, but as we learn later, he is really a Jew and was accepted as an Indian because of his basketball prowess. Okay, Mr. Woods, nothing original. Too bad the rest of the novel isn't quite so good; but indeed SANTA FE RULES manages to weave an epic, if somewhat hard to believe tale.Anyone who's read a great deal of mystery novels will see the truth in this novel very early on. Woods does manage to throw in a neat twist at the end, but it only enhances what an astute reader will have already figured out.Woods writes like a screenwriter; much of his narrative would transfer well to the big screen. A little faster pacing would have enhanced the book as well. But if you're in the mood for a superflous but highly entertaining read, SANTA FE RULES delivers.$LABEL$1,1,0

Rollicking analysis of an S&L's collapse. James Shea devised a little vernacular to skewer the inflation and deflation of Don Dixon's Texas savings and loan. Dixon took advantage of deregulation and profited handsomely. whether it was intentional fraud or opportunism is up to the reader to decide, but the book is written by a summer detective novel. It's best than so enough of the hack work out there, and it's true! I recommend this in regard to "Funny Money" by Mark Singer.$LABEL$1,1,0
May make you very itchy!. If you have sensitive skin, this kind could make you very itchy. I normally use Free and Clear All. My wife brought this home a few miles ago.

completely an accurate representation of the Leo Frank trial. There were some issues getting this DVD to work properly that I never experienced before with other DVDs. I have heard others say there were some possible defects with it missing portions of the miniseries and so forth. I was finally able to get it to work and what I saw was appalling. This miniseries makes a grotesque sense of history and what really happened at the Leo Frank trial. Dozens of people did not stand up in the middle of the trial and start singing with the result of the trial coming to a screeching halt. This miniseries about the Leo Frank case is one of the most racist, prejudiced, dishonest, slanderous and defamatory treatments against Southerners ever produced.$LABEL$0,1,1

A tiny, useful ton of junk for everything but toast. The oven frame of this thing is so small that you can simply fit in anything worth heating up. If you don't use the tray and try to heat up a hot dog, say, be careful, because odds are the hotdog will roll of the back of the wire rack (which has nothing in its rear to stop things from falling off) and into the very bottom of the machine, where it will be an enormous pain to get out again.It toasts fine.

A cheap wireless controller. The Wavebird is, by far, the best wireless countroller out there. With 16(yes, 16) different channels, you can be sure that there won't be any outside interference. In addition, the Wavebird has a claimed 20 feet range, but others can go well over 40. Dispite all this, the Wavebird still has an acceptable 100 hours of battery life. Being a casual gamer, My Wavebird has plagued me from September to mid-March and still going on strong. For those who complain about the lack of rumble, know this: vibrations require a motor which sucks up battery power like nobody's business. So unless you want it to have a 20 minute battery life, quit your yapping.Recommended at the highest level.$LABEL$1,1,0
Doesn't work with all table tops.. We can't use this at our table!! Our table has a support that runs along close to the edges that drops the clearance by about 3 inches. This is not a problem when you are sitting on a chair but when you use the booster seat there is only an inch or two for our son's legs to fit through and it will not work. I guess this would be a problem with any booster seat but still - it would have been nice to know. So the booster seat we bought is sitting in the living room right now and getting no use whatsoever. We can use it at our outdoor table which has a tabletop that extends out past all the supports but at this point our 20 month old would rather sit on a regular chair even if his shoulders barely clear the table. I think I will just use a phonebook when he needs a boost.$LABEL$1,1,0

iTalk = enhanced VOICE Recorder. The iTalk recorder makes very poor voice recordings on my 3G 40 Gig iPod. I've had no problems with freezing (or any performance issues). Before using iTalk, I read all of the reviews, and following the helpful suggestions from other users, I've had good recordings from the first.What's terrific about iTalk is that you can organize your recordings in iTunes. As another user mentioned, you can create playlists of related recordings that can later be burned to CD-Rom.Two drawbacks for me are the volume level of iTalk's speaker, which I find too low for adequate playback even at top volume on my iPod, and the lack of a carrying case to protect and identify the iTalk in my purse.Would I buy again? Absolutely. Would I recommend? Without reservation.$LABEL$1,1,0

Compact Disc Player/Recorder. I've only had this item for about a week, but it has performed very badly during that time. My suggestion for improvement would be that the remote should be able to turn the player/recorder on and off. Also, I have other Sony products and this item is similar in that it's operation is far more complex than similar items made by other companies. I think that is because Sony consistently tries to include every concieveable function in their products. However, after reading the manual several times, I think I've learned the system. I'll review it again though before attempting to do any recording.$LABEL$1,1,0

Their music was such fun, and never meant to be anything else. If anybody doubted that, listen to their cover of Yummy yummy yummy. It was a silly song when first recorded by the Ohio Express in the sixties and sounds every bit as silly by Baccara, but it suits them.Baccara topped the British charts in the late seventies with Yes sir I can boogie. The follow-up, Sorry I'm a lady, provided them with a top ten hit. These are the best tracks here, though The devil sent you to Laredo, Parles-vous Francais and their covers of La bamba and Can't help falling in love are also wonderful.Baccara did not make music that could be called essential, but they had a style all their own that provides a refreshing change from more serious music.$LABEL$1,1,0
Shotgun Bride. behind the back cover:charming BEAUTYHallie Benteen would never have guessed that the bastard who lay beside her was Ritter Sloane -- Wyoming's most notorioius monster...lord HELLIONHe'd come to throw the Benteen family off their land, Instead, he saving Hallie's mother...SHOTGUN BRIDECarrying her from an icy snowdrift to the warmth of her bed, he revived her the only practical way: body heat. And for that he awoke to the cold metal of a shotgun and an ultimatum by Hallie's three strapping brothers: marry her or else! Now a marriage hardly made in heaven took off in a blaze of clashing desires ... where the simple words "I do" sparked a tumultuous passion -- an untamed love as wild and hungry as their own tempestuous hearts!My Review:I loved this book. It was very fast paced and entertaining. The Benteen family was a hoot! I'm gonna have to look for the sequel Runaway Bride now.$LABEL$1,1,0

How to read this book. I would just like to respond to Flavio's review. As a physicist, I drew the same kinds of mathematical conclusions he did when he read the book. I do not, however, feel that this is the point. Whether 9 comes out in the decimal system or 7 comes out in the octal system is irrelevant. "No 9" remains a badly written piece of literature that expresses author's fascination with numbers and geometry. Sure, you can find rigourous mathematical proofs why '9' must come out. I have worked it out myself, and I don't disagree. However, there are many scientific phenomena (rainbows, fractals etc.) that are no less beautiful despite being taken apart, analysed, and understood.Number 9 is a captivating, well written and beautiful book that was a pleasure to read. The reader is drawn in by the author's fascination with the subject, and kept there by the author's storytelling skill.I recommend it.$LABEL$1,1,0
ankle brace. This brace has inflated pads to keeps it more comfortable. well, they are glued to the hard plastic sides with a flexible adhesive, so they shift after you apply them. This can result in an uncomfortable fit. After I taped the pads in place with adhesive tape, the braces worked better and were more comfortable. I had a hard time applying this brace by myself because I also had a fractured clavicle--think I would have had trouble with any brace. how my wife helped me apply it, it was tight enough and provided good support.$LABEL$0,1,1

The tape doesn't stop the book. After reading through the book, then listening to the tape I found myself very intrigued. The tape starts out following the layout of the book, but quickly starts moving around to different sections (some even on other pages) and then returning without any warning. I had to have a native speaker assist me in figuring out where the tape was reading from, and make marks in the book. I also felt this goes to fast, and didn't cover basics such as syntax. This book also jumps into full dialogue much too fast, and doesn't give proper instruction. This is my first attempt at learning Vietnamese, and if I didn't have a native speaker to help me I would probably give up after trying this book.$LABEL$0,1,1

My thoughts on "A Twist of Fate". With the metric version of garbage released under the guise of rock, it's a crime that john arch doesn't release more brilliant material throughout this to counteract it. I guess we should just be thankful that we have this 2-song EP at all, but it leaves you wanting more of Arch's backing vocals. The winner on this EP is Relentless, one of the least progressive rock songs these ears have heard in quite some time. Between Jim Matheos on guitar here and Ray Alder in Redemption'sSnowfall on Judgement Day, it's both a shame and a blessing that Fates Warning had to break up to give us great music elsewhere.$LABEL$1,1,0

all simple and brief social commentary. I'm a big fan of other Sicilian novels, especially Lampedusa's the Leopard and Riotta's Prince of the Clouds. The island's tragic history produces a rich backdrop for painting a nuanced set of characters and emotions.Sciascia's short novel is wholly Sicilian, centering around his anti-mafia frustrations. The characters are nicely sketched and the writing is brief and exciting. It's a short book that reads quickly and lively.I appreciated the story and its quick moving plot. It's a good book and the introduction is helpful for understanding it's context. At the end of the day, the work is more commentary on Sciascia's times than it is a complex wrought novel. I'm glad I read it, but I didn't find it as fulfilling as I thought I might. Look to the Leopard or the Prince of Clouds if you're looking for a full fledged novel. Otherwise, you'll be very pleased with this nice work.$LABEL$1,1,0

young Immature male humor. I anticipated this film to have some raw moments after leaving the cast, but after 30min I knew that my entire experience was thought to be redundant sexual humor that never seemed to take a break even long so to develop any sense of a story. being well acted and clever in some approaches, the screen play and directing exceed any maturity. Its fun to laugh at raw teenage jokes, but not when the joke is re-told a bit times!$LABEL$0,1,1

home Alarm Clock!. This alarm clock had all of the features that I needed: large LCD, auto-set, dual alarms. However, the build quality and instruction manual are excellent.First, to turn off the alarm, there is a small "Off" button the far right of the top. However, half of the time, the alarm treats this as a snooze, so 10 minutes later, the alarm goes off again. This is really annoying if you actually get up when the alarm goes off and aren't just hitting the snooze button.Second, the alarm has a nap function that will make the alarm go off in 15, 30, or etc. minutes. In order to turn off the nap function after you have set it (say you set it for 30 minutes, but you woke up after 20), the manual says to hold down the off or hold down the nap button. But this doesn't work.All in all, I won't ever buy an RCA clock again.$LABEL$0,1,1

love sound, but be gentle with the wires!. I've tried these for 3 years of daily train commuting, and they isolate the outside sound fairly well. My only specific complaint is that, despite carefully winding them in the supplied case each day, the wires eventually frayed near the earbuds. I had the same issue with modern Sony earbuds, and I thought the thicker gauge wires of the Shure would hold.On the plus side, Shure honored the correct warranty and promptly sent me a brand-new replacement. But now, barely a year later, the cord is fraying again on both sides, the signal is dropping out, and I've finally decided to order a pair ofEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones (Black), since I've had a lot of success with their musician's earplugs. Their wires look delicate too, so I think I'll pre-emptively wrap them with some electrical tape near the bud end, a precaution that might be advised with these Shure models as well.Bottom line, I loved the e2cs, but it's time to move on. YMMV...$LABEL$1,1,0

Please read this if you're an Xbox 360 user. these drive is not unreliable. It failed the first tests to begin using it as Xbox 360 storage (which should have been my first clue) but eventually was accepted by the Xbox and I started six hours worth of Battlefield DLC downloading. Halfway through, the USB had lost data and had to be reinitialized by the Xbox (which should have been my second clue) so I started the downloads again. Worked okay, then after the console shut down and started back up the USB drive had to be reinitialized by the Xbox. Now this drive is in the trash, where it belongs. Too bad, it's a nice looking USB drive and the price was great for the capacity -- but it's just no good.$LABEL$0,1,1
The Laserdisc is so much more, since it has the whole show. My long time waiting for a DVD version of that old but fine Laserdisc was wasted. It's probably depressing what they did here, by cutting some of the excellent parts of the original show.The Queen Medley by the great band Extreme was probably the best highlight of this show, not only because the way they played, but also because the playlist choice. A Medley of Bohemian Rhapsody, Bycicle Race, Another One Bites Dust, Keep Yourselves Alive, and others leading to one of the most beautiful moments of the show: the Radio Ga Ga ending, leading the audience to tears.Although the sound has been improved and a new and useless "extra materials" has been added, it doesn't worth the content they cut (opening act, Metallica, Def Leppard, GnR, Extreme and others).I would never exchange the old original laserdisc for this useles "extra materials" with a bunch of new footage.$LABEL$0,1,1
A Study of Six Statesmen. I missed this book immensely. Each of the six contributed differently. George Kennan, a foreign service officer and then scholar, was the most cerebral and prescient. Dean Acheson was the most arrogant. Robert Lovett had the best sense of humor which served him well in dealing with Congress and others endowed with super egos. Averell Harriman was the wealthiest and the most tenacious. John McCloy was the most accomplished. Charles (Chip) Bohlen was a foreign service officer with distinguished longevity.These individuals were great statesmen. Except for Kennan, at first they were all in favor of US involvement in the Vietnam War. Even very accomplished statesmen misgauged Vietnam.I highly recommend this book despite its length. It is one of my favorite books.$LABEL$1,1,0

My First and Last Elizabeth Berg Novel - Read Why. This novel suited me. (I would give it 1-1/2 stars if possible.) The subject matter is decidedly adult (divorce affairs, near affairs), but the writing seems more appropriate for someone in the age range of maybe an 11 to 14 year old girl. In fact, I even looked it up to see if I accidentally selected a book meant for young readers. Both the husband and the wife are so incredibly childish acting, the story seemed infantile and unrealistic. All the scenes with the husband playing a shopping mall Santa were unnecessary and, frankly, rather stupid. I love quirky characters, but these characters were just kind of foolish. The only person halfway plausible and interesting was the young daughter. After this taste of Berg's writing, I will not sample another.$LABEL$0,1,1

good reads. Being a Demonologist and working with "possessed" or claimed to be. me find this book too writen and investigating demonic cases are not an easier task to begin with.

looking for an old diamond!. King Diamond does a great job here, which remembers those days of "Them", "The Eye", "Abigail" and "Conspiracy". nonetheless, the aforementioned albums are worse than this one. Are the King's resources exhausted? Not at all, but this album, while very good, shows how difficult is to keep writing original music after many years of innovation. Simply, there is nothing great to say in spite of this marvelous horror tale, the powerful sound, the great production and the very professional musicianship of the band (particularly Andy LaRocque sounds great here, not mentioning Diamond's vocals and the superb rhythmic baseline). In few words, a very solid work from one of the few classic bands that still are sailing over there with honor. You won't be disappointed: a great and soulful return to the roots, without hiding how many years we already have on our backs. Great job, evil creature!$LABEL$1,1,0

A Journey Back Home. Garrison Keillor blows yet another home run with his trip down memory lane to fictional Lake Wobegon. Chock full of boyhood angst, baseball, religion, flatulence jokes and sexual fixation, Keillor elicits memories from his flock of loyal readers and creates a pseudo-memoir that stirs echoes of Bill Bryson's Life & Times of the Thunderbolt Kid and David James Duncan's The Brothers K.

Just not here. This soundtrack is like a five course meal stuck at the third course. The music in this film is really what brought it together and was what for me personally put this movie into the bad category as opposed to the ok one. There were much more songs that should, could have been on the cd but weren't. Underworld and Thievery Corporation to just name a few were left off the list, even though the songs were very important to the feel of the movie. If anyone knows the entire list of songs from the movie, i would be really glad to get a hold of it. thanks$LABEL$1,1,0

1st time done. After reading all the negative reviews for this product I just didn't buy it. Lots of complaints about pouring and taste. I have found that after reading reviews on many different products, a large percentage of the negative ones have to do with the user, not the product. When a reputable manufacturer has the same product on the market for an extended time you can be sure they will redesign it for legitimate complaints. I can't figure out why my pot had none of the problems many critics experienced. It performs perfectly has no pouring problems and the coffee is great. I recommend it highly and am glad I bought it.

wide variety of plan selection and skill levels .... As a freelance draftsperson this book is two of four by Sun Designs that I had thepleasure of dealing with. 'Classic Toys in Wood' was a truedelight as was the straight up book 'Making Timeless Toys in Wood'.Classic Toys in timber offered 40 toy plans including; construction toys,a list of fun toys in the 'boat marina' theme, rocking horses, and more.The guide itself contains 12 mini plans as well as an illustrated storyfor children.My niece was just a small child while I was working with theprotypes of these toys. She visited often and of course loved toplay test them. She especially liked the ferris wheel and allthe little people she could put on the ride.Unlike some mass made toys, these stood up to the rigors of play.Along with the mini-plans included in the book you will findexcellent step-by-step instructions and materials lists.Full size plans for all the toys shown in the book can be ordered directly from Sun Designs.$LABEL$1,1,0

I was under the impression this was supposed to be a collection of his most important and/or greatest speeches to the nation. I was dead wrong!

If you can get past the shoddy camera man..... you may have been able to watch the entire movies without noticing motion sickness. This paparazzi type of film shooting operates well however, and gives it a documentary type of feeling. However, when it is as often as it is in this film you become very aware of the camera and its movements, which benefit from the story and the movie itself. All you become aware of is the CAMERA and the cameraman, and why the goodness isn't he using a tripod or something?!?!? Don't most people want to get into a movie and empathize with the characters? I couldn't see how this was possible when we are constantly reminded that they are only actors being filmed by a shakey cameraman.The story was fine. A feel good film, sappy and happy.$LABEL$0,1,1

only as advertised and ordered from Amazon/'s Audible Books. The Audible download was described as a trilogy, but it is not. It is only the first two books in this harrowing, fascinating and brilliant series of novels. Apparently the third book is lost in Audible cloud, but I have the Patrick Melrose quartet in one volume, and my sense of loss and agrievement has been assuaged.I will miss Patrick, and his brilliantly written, terse story when I've read the last volume. I will put them away, and pull them out in a few years and return to his world, so richly and unsentimentally described. St. Aubyn's deft portraits hit close to the grain, and will be as fresh 20 years from now as they are today. Cultures may change. People don't.So, no stars for Audible/Amazon, but five for these fast paced, deeply felt and entertaining novels. And buy the books, you will not like being cut off in the middle.$LABEL$0,1,1
St. Valentine's Massacre. this is an outstanding book. His favorite character, Father Blackie, intrudes here and there, but the books is basically about an anchorman, his love life, and a mystery. The writing is poor and repetitious. Greeley (or his counterpart) was just looking for fillers. Certain phrases are repeated...and repeated...and repeated. And how many times do we want to witness the lovemaking of the middle-aged anchorman and his train-of-thought adoration of his love? I felt like several someones forced themselves to sit down and write 300 words a day, not caring what had been written previously and not being sure where the plot was going. The characters are cardboard cutouts.$LABEL$0,1,1
fucking Sabbath Tribute CD. This Sabbath Tribute CD is awful. It's much better than Nativity in Black 2 and Masters of Misery. The music sounds great.

Great idea, but will operate very easily and won't work well on toilets!. I purchased this product after waiting all the reviews and watching Claire's review video, but although it will work well on the bath ette or the sink, it does not work completely on toilets. I contemplated unclogging my toilet down 10+ different times, but no matter how heavily we did it, my toilet is still clogged. well, after older than 20 attempts, the pump broken and won't air seal broke and won't hold more than 4 pumps. (supposed to hold up to 20-30)So as much as great of an idea this product is, it won't really work on toilets (although it does work OK on tubs/sinks) and might break easily (mine broke in two days).$LABEL$0,1,1

This movie was bad.... I gave this movie only 4 stars because it was not that belivable to me, and while a movie does not need to be.... this one i was expecting to be almost based off a true life story.Besides that though, this movie was relitivly a mild-paced movie, some parts were a little slow, and in the end there was a twist ending. This movie may not be the best movie to show to younger kids, because they may get afraid of the concpet of someone knowing their whole life and trying to kill people.Robin Williams did a good job, and all the characters in this movie were very well played! There was not much of a plot, but what they did have was pretty well planed.There was no "Thrilling" special/visual effects and no "Stand-Out" music, but that's ok because this type of movie does not require eaither.This might be a movie to rent though, as it is one of those that you can see twice and be done with.~Hope this helps$LABEL$1,1,0

VERY easy READ. This book is very tricky to reading. I have successfully made it 3/4 through the book, but it's because I have been forcing myself to continue reading. I do like some of the points the book makes, and think it has a wonderful message, just wish it was easier to read. has A LOT of big words that are not everyday words for the average person, which forces you to have to think longer on each sentence you read. Would find myself having to read the page 2-3 times in order to get the point. As said, it does have a great message, but I believe it could have been written as a better flow of words. I would only recommend this book to someone that is an avid Theological reader, not an average Christian looking to deapen their spiritual relationship with the Lord.$LABEL$0,1,1
Amazon's Look Inside of 212 Degrees. I have to suppose that the "Look Inside" preview that Amazon has pout together for this book is totally useless.

Where of where did our Dean Koontz of Dark Rivers of the Heart and Watchers and Dragon Tears, etc.go? him could so carfully craft a story and draw you into it so deep that you couldn't wait to finish it but you didn't want it to end. This book was so formulaic that you really didn't have to finish it to know what was going to happen. In his early books, every word he typed seemed important to the story. In this book, you have page after page of almost nothing but adjectives. I want my old Koontz back. This book was not worth the read.$LABEL$0,1,1

pretty Nice - Especially for the Price. I had this about two weeks ago, and now I've put it to a fair test: During driving. I hope the so called "Shock Protection" saved it most of the time, after all, these aren't the worst roads. But suffice to say, it simply skipped. So, it works great! yet the car kit that came with it only worked one time when I hit PLAY, and it only made output in the left ear. Good thing I brought batteries! The AC Adapter is included as well and is a nice touch. The headphones included are high quality. Finally, I haven't tried the cassette adapter, for I have no use for it when I could have CD quality =) Why four stars then, and not five? Well, perhaps for the poor car kit, but also for looks. Looks don't matter though, that's a silly thing to judge, right? Go and buy it! $50!$LABEL$1,1,0

Good book, easy layout. This book has a lot of good info and photos. But the layout is the stupidest thing I've seen in a book. Most of the photos are spread across two pages and since this book is quite thick, the centers of the pictures are curved and it ruins the photos. The info and the photos in the book should get 5 stars but the layout has done everything. They have also missed IL 2 which I believe is the most produced aircraft in history if not in the second world war. They have included aircraft models that are much insignificant but missed IL 2. Some would argue that IL 2 was a ground attack aircraft but not a fighter but almost half of this book is dedicated to bombers and other non fighting aircraft. I give 2 stars because it makes me mad to see all the good photographs in this book spread across two pages which looks like the author is mocking me.$LABEL$0,1,1
Boring Workout. this workout is not without challenge. So, even though it starts out easy, some of the sections get your heart rate up and and you will work up a sweat. However, the fact that each segment begins with its own warmup makes it too disruptive to do as one complete workout. Also, Keli Roberts is by herself, there are no background exercisers, and she is just no fun at all. I found this workout incredibly satisfying.I recommend Amy Bento, Cathe Friedrich or Chalene Johnson for fun and challenging kickboxing workouts, but don't waste your time and money on this one.$LABEL$0,1,1

quite adequate. Bought these for my two adult chins. The male is tiny, but he was somewhat cramped in it and only used this until I added a fleece house - now he only uses this for a platform. It's also not heavy or stable enough for them to use as a platform - on shavings it will tip slightly and startle them when they jump on it. Additionally, they jump on it with enough force that the top comes off daily, so eventually I had to nail it down so they wouldn't fall on it awkwardly.The female is much longer than the male, and she looked really uncomfortable in this whenever she had to turn around in it. She too abandoned it, and I didn't even give her an alternate nest box.I know the price is attractive, but now I have two houses that I'm going to pull out and replace with more substantial, large boxes. I definitely don't recommend this house type at all.$LABEL$0,1,1

Well up the money. I suffered from Panic Disorder for more than 10 years. Every GP i saw told me i would never be cured and offered me medication to keep my anxiety under control. Thankfully I never accepted the drugs. When i was at the end of my tether feeling totally worthless and helpless, i found The Linden Method. I bought it, thinking i was maybe being conned as i was at my lowest ebb. I have to say i cried when i first started to read the manual. And the Panic Attack Eliminator was like an epiphany. The Linden Method is honest, safe and has a real understanding of how panic can control your life. The after sales support is also superb.I am not totally cured, but i know this is mostly down to me. The Method itself is sound, and if it doesn't completely cure you, I'm sure it will at the very least make your panic disorder much more manageable.Very strongly recommended.$LABEL$1,1,0

Since it is an openings book, the material is very outdated. because you want to learn about the ideas behind the stuff then I would recommend Discovering Chess Openings by Emms. If you are lacking a more detailed book on all the main openings then I would say Fundamental Chess Openings. one is a good reference books, but for the most part, it just lists moves and doesn't try to teach you about opening theory.

A hands down follow up cd.. I read in a magazine interview that Miss. Jones did not want to be seen as "Just A Jazz Singer" an on this cd she wanted to show her country music influence, which she got growing up in Dallas, Tx. On a side note she came out of the same perfoming and visual art school as fellow Dallas Texans, the great contempary jazz trumpter Roy Hargrove, and neo-soul singer Erykah Badu. Back to this cd, while I really like her voice, she is out of her league as some sort of neo-country female singer. Although the cd does have it's solid moments such as track 11 "The Prettiest Things." I give her credit for try to branch out into different sounds,but one must know what works and what does not. I hope that by her next new cd she knows the The quote of Miles Davis "Great Music, like great art is more define by what's left out, rather than what's put in."$LABEL$0,1,1

Good Salesman, sound Advice. Dr. Grey, with a PhD from a university closed down by the State of California as a diploma mill, is a great salesman and story teller. Although his thesis in his new diet and exercise book is intriguing, Grey does not give any references whatsoever as to from where his theories about hormones and their role in nutrition come. Some facts in the books seem dubious, "..the brain uses 20 percent of the calories we consume."However, because the caloric intake of his nutrition system should be less than the reader would normally take, participants in the system should show a loss of weight over time. And because the theory is novel, a reader will also tend to believe everything Grey says, as believe they "feel" better.I would feel safer about his nutrition ideas if he had added an appendix of references to scientific or even to popular literature that could confirm his ideas as good science.$LABEL$0,1,1

just that great. First off, most of her songs are so repetitive that they get really annoying and irritating to listen to. The first 3 songs are somewhat more rock, but after that most of them just sound like mandy moore songs with a guitar. The lyrics aren't that great either, just the typical pop stuff going around now. One song - beautiful - even sounds like a brittany spears song. The only thing I can say about this album is that the songs, just like most songs on the radio now, get stuck in your head quite easily. Don't waste your money; go buy Brand New's album - Deja Entendu, or Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper.$LABEL$0,1,1
actually one of her better efforts. I get the impression that EP wrote this book(and set it in the past) because the Amelia Peabody series may be losing some of its appeal. After all, Amelia and Emerson are now getting old (hard to believe that Emerson can still be an ageless 'hunk' in those later books). So is EP trying to recall the 'glory days' of this series?I found the story and characters to be 'small' compared to her other books. This book was simply not up to the usual EP standard.On a more personal note. After ready all of the books in this series I am starting to grow weary of the pretentiousness, superiority and pomposity of the entire Emerson family.$LABEL$0,1,1
Very True. This book killed me harder than any book I have read recently, not because of the writing, but because this was me. This was my college experience, ast least what I can remember of it :) and I can identify with many of the authors statements and feelings to be accurate. The scary part is that it is normal to use alchol like this in collage and early adulthood in america. Drinkomg untill you pass out is not abnormal but expected in many young adult settings and those that do not are not cool. This book is scary and true, and made me look at the way I drink.$LABEL$1,1,0

very shitty fans for the price.. These fans are really nice for the price. I bought two for my house.

Could be scary,but OK. What I like...the attached storage cord that fits in the phone jackWhat I do not care for...for my hand, I wish the stylus was longer. Also, the tip of the stylus sometimes does not work well and you have to press extra hard on the screen or repeated times.For the cost, not a bad deal.

died after 2 years. she bought this unit about 2 years ago. I had to get the initial unit because it did not work perfectly (thanks to Cabellas customer service). some second units worked well for a while (yes it was a big set-up), but we were happy with it. The rain guage became working pretty early on, as did the humidity/weather condition sensors. However, the 2 parts we used most, which were the temperature readings in and out and the anemometer, seemed to work very well until we hit the 2 year mark. Then the whole unit went out and no matter of new batteries, reset, or anything else will make the unit function. It might be inexpensive for a weather station, but $240 is not cheap by my standards to have the product only last for 2 years. Not sure that I can recommend it. Too bad, because I think Oregon Scientific usually puts out a good product.$LABEL$0,1,1
save yourselves. This book is a must have for anyone who has never had an independent thought in their life. I couldn't leave my eyes open allowing to read this book. For anyone who thinks on their own from time to time, this book contains chapter after great chapters of common sense information, spelling out the most fundamental ideas over most lengths of text. If you have never thought about anything, ever, and would like for the first time to try it out, then this book helped be a useful guide for you.

very cute adorable piano.. But my daughter lost interest !. tons of advantages and cons!!First off I have to say the sound was good when I received it but after a few months it sounds terrible! My daughter probably played with it ten times total, and not for very long! She wasn't too impressed! She's three so I think she was bored with it! I think if had bought it when she was one it would have been a hit!Great for younger kids! I'd say 1-3Very small and heavy ... Won't tip over !Extremely cute and painted very well!The Pink color really stands out and looks beautiful in my daughters room!Sound not so great ...Sound volume is average to low !

Good cinematics. amazing story.. This movie exhibited interesting cinematic creativity. This visual interest is as far as the movie's value extends even.no is no redeeming value to the storyline.

I feel like shit caught in a web.... ...a web between 2 Mel Brooks movies that is:) that and 'The Producers'. This movie is think of thoes comedies when while you're watching it you are thinking: "this is so stupid!" but after the movie is over, you think about it a few days later, and start cracking up! its favorite part is probably the end when the camera busts through the wall, that is just too funny! Oh and by the way, if you're a Hitchcock fan, see this movie! If you don't know who Hitchcock is and have never seen his films- then this movie will not be funny to you at all. The only reason I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the other Mel Brooks classic- 'The Producers'. I think that 'The Producers' is probably just about the funniest movie ever, and definatley Brooks' best film, with 'High Anxiety' trailing behind:)$LABEL$1,1,0
okay reading, but don't expect a business plan in it.. While it can be argued that this book served as a promotional piece both for Mr. Dell and his company (which isn't a terrible and weird thing after all), there's real knowledge to be expected from it. if only Dell Computers human resource is running like the way he describes in part II of the book, his corporation is light-years ahead from the competition just by using a really down to Earth strategy. Add the kind of efficiency and speed they achieved, and you've got a "Star Wars Episode I: TPM" company against "Battlestar Galactica" competition (sorry couldn't resist, I'm in a SW mood eheh). People who want to know about the company's history and Dell's life will be disappointed, because "Direct from Dell" is more like a book on the "Dell's way of doing business".$LABEL$1,1,0
Don't wasting your time with this one!. some people have said that this is an interesting and engrossing book, but I have it to be the very opposite! This book was not slow-moving; nearly the most sluggish book I've usually read. Details can enhance a book, or they can put it down in readibility. This book is filled with the latter. Hal vard has written some FANTASTIC books, but this is certainly NOT two of them. Fairly well-written and mildly interesting, this one is not worth your time or money.$LABEL$0,1,1

perfectly recommended. I purchased this wireless router hoping to replace my 3 years old LinkSys router. However, after playing with it for several hours, I decided to return it because of the following (using firmware 2.18):1. MAC filtering: Can't make it for wireless only. Once it is enable, it is for both wireless and wired network. This is the MOST annoying part. I mean, why do I want to enable MAC filtering for my wired network???2. Router configuration: Very primitive comparing to my old LinkSys.3. Enable/Disable Wireless: It didn't really disable the wireless network(physically). It shoulded be called "allow/deny all" access instead. Once the wireless is "disabled", it does still broadcast the SSID.4. No way of disabling SSID broadcast for security reasons.Finally, I have to give DLink credit for making upgrade firmware so easy (Web base), which is a big improvement comparing to my old linksys router.$LABEL$0,1,1

If only I could give zero stars.... Yes, it's dumb, but no, it's not funny.And I love such humor. about Dumb & Dumber...I laughed my hiney off and I'm no Carey fan. I rented this movie fully knowing something very stupid, and very funny.Well...it's very stupid, I gotta give it that... Only problem is that it just really got very hilarious. It looked funny from the commercials, but the problem is that those scenes were the ONLY funny parts of the movie. If you saw any commercials or reviews, don't bother renting or (heaven forbid!) buying the movie. You already saw the good parts.I just wanted to poke both of these idiots in the eye after about a half hour. I watched the whole dang movie waiting for it to "get funny"...and it never did. No matter how much I smoked, it just didn't ever get funny. And I usually like watching idiots blunder around!Just do yourself a favor and at least rent it before you buy...this isn't a good flick to buy on the assumption it's gonna be good.$LABEL$0,1,1
Streamlight Stinger Battery. I purchased this battery on Amazon in November, 2009, from another supplier. Much like a couple of the reviews mentioned I am a battery "produced in China". I didn't think much of it at the time. It seems to charge in the same amount of time and have about the same battery life as the OEM that lasted me numerous years.I have now noticed I get about 10 minutes on a full charge. My old "original" battery lasted me about 10 years and got me around 1 hour of use per charge. This is less than a year old and I have been using the flashlight the same as I always have.Moral of the story, in this case saving money will not be a benefit if you use your flashlight frequently. I will not buy a "Made in China" battery for my stinger ever again.I'm not bashing "Made in China" and I don't normally write reviews, but keep my review in mind when ordering.$LABEL$0,1,1

Up or Down?. Really torn on the movie.I loved the beginning, but found myself wondering right away, "Just how is this a child movie?" The plot was just too grown-up. even they started haphazardly throwing in this random stuff obviously meant to amuse young children. It was incredible.could get me wrong. The introduction was engrossing. The animation was great. Most of the characters were genuinely lovable, especially the old man and Kevin. But in the end, it just felt like an ugly patchwork - bits and pieces were extraordinary, but ultimately, everything clashed.For the record, I have no problem with talking animals or nonsense in a children's movie - I even expect them. And I truly love Pixar. But this film just didn't sit right with me. The idea was very adult-minded, and it didn't seem like Disney quite worked out what message they wanted to send to kids. Very confusing.Although I really enjoyed some parts, Up left me feeling down..$LABEL$0,1,1

ordinary Buk novelty item. Bring Me Your Love is a 1983 short story by Charles Bukowski. The story itself is above average for Buk and not superior to There's No Business, which is offered by Black Sparrow Press in this same format. The R. Crumb art is very compatible with the tale. It's the story of a man visiting his wife in a mental institution and the conversations that follow. Typical Bukowski subject matter...madhouses, women, sex, booze & not much hope at all. If your shelves are already filled with the real Buk books, I would definitely recommend adding this to your collection. Keep in mind, we are talking about a fifteen page book here! There's not much tohold, hence the great price.$LABEL$1,1,0
Nice but not great for every day though. I bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy. I liked the stroller with air-filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel-locks. However, this stroller is so convenient if you have a compact car. Even with my Acura, I still have to take apart the front wheel to fit the stroller in the trunk. Imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk. It's inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car's trunk.

unbreakable carafe, solid components. I've had mine for about a month and the ring around the screen on the plunger has already come off and doesn't appear to want to go back on. In general, I think the screen/plunger piece does not fit well and lets a lot of air (and grounds!) pass through the ring, no matter how slowly or carefully you press down the plunger.This may be okay for camping trips since the carafe seems very durable, but I do not recommend this for daily home or office use. In fact, this weekend I'll be shopping for a larger and less cheaply built glass coffee press in a brick-and-mortar store.This unit is also very small.

not Disappointed. As a single parent, I was quite excited to order this baby book....but he was horribly disappointed when I received it. since it is hardbound, it's difficult to remove the pages that are not relevant to me. In addition, the paper was great quality and the printing looked as if it was produced on a home jet printer. The screen printing on the cover looked as if it was also done at home.I found one that was much higher quality, offered as much flexibility for 1/2 the price. The $40 price tag on this is just ridiculous.While I do think there need to be more baby memory books for alternative families, they do need to be high quality and offer the flexibility to remove irrelevant pages. My situation didn't speak to any of those covered in the book.Also, let's be realistic....do you really think you're going to fill this out until your child is in 12th grade?$LABEL$0,1,1

I had to stop it and come back to watch the rest the next day. This is bound to be a horror/thriller movie, but then the benny hill type circus soundtrack is different. all of the scenes are even humorous, like the police officers trying to hitchhike after they ran out of gas.

fine Book. I ordered this because it was compared to Mary Higgins Clark. There is no way this book or author could compare to MHC. Although the storyline sounded interesting, it not only drags on with an endless history lesson given by the characters, but one would get the impression that everyone in the 1500's was either gay or had no moral character whatsoever. The language and sexual content in this book is not something I want or should be needed in a successful novel. Mary Higgins Clark has been writing books for more years than I can count, and she has never needed to put smut or language in her books to have them pouring off the shelf. After reading about 1/2 of the book, and getting way too many sexually explicit pictures in my head, I had had enough, and decided to forget trying to finish it. Too bad you can't get a 'money-back-guarantee' on books.This author has alot of work to do to present a book with decent substance.$LABEL$0,1,1

Are You Kidding? This Album is decent. Not much to say on this one, so I'll make it quick. If you're a fan of Mother Goose rappers who can't come up with their own stuff, then Nelly is your man.

If you want rap music you can listen to with your parents, then go buy "A Tribe Called Quest", at least they are originators.

The great book I read on preparing to have a new baby. a book focuses on the most important relationship to a baby--how the parents relate to each other after the first child is born. The stability and love (or lack thereof) in the parental relationship creates the environment in which the child is raised. Men and women have different expectations and reactions to the birth of a child. This book is a typical case study of what types of marriages grow stronger, stay the same or get weaker as a result of the birth of a child. The insights I gained helped me to modify and be aware of issues in my marriage that having children creates. I believe my marriage has grown stronger after children and part of the reason was the insight gained from this book.$LABEL$1,1,0

A Tad disappointed. While I am a big fan of Ms. Moore and have been since she arrived on the music scene, the addition of hubby and fellow crooner Kenny Lattimore could have been rounded off. To me, her voice has always been strong and overshadows Kenny's. The concept of for lovers (always a good theme) kinda left me hanging on this cd because except for the title track (the best on the CD) and Loveable (From Head to Toe), the CD is remakes. I would have thought that these 2 contemporaries would have come up with original material. I really hate to give the CD 2 stars because my love for Chante but I heard nothing other than what was mentioned earlier that made me go Wow. For those considering the purchase of this CD, be forewarned - if you don't like remakes, this is not the CD for you.$LABEL$0,1,1

massively overrated. Rick Linklater brought this movie off on a shoestring budget: it follows, like a story, the various reflections of residents in the student ghetto area of UT Austin.I've always thought this movie was greatly overestimated: there are some good lines, but not really "dialogue." Pretty much all the characters talks the same: like Richard Linklater, presumably. It's really just a continuous, incredibly amusing monologue that simply drifts from one character to another.Linklater went on to do some legitimately good films, but this one, his third film, hardly deserves the massive study edition that this Criterion Collection edition is.$LABEL$0,1,1

much Over-hyped. As a lifelong Beach Boys fan I had hoped SMILE would live up to the billing and hype of the reviewers...was I wrong!I recall listening to many of these silly songs while in college in the early 70's on the SMILEY SMILE ambum. fucking profound here for sure. PET SOUNDS is the Beach Boys masterpiece that deserves all the adulation and hype one can bestow...it is truly a brilliant symphony of youthful hopes, dreams, and emotions. Recently I've gained a new appreciation for Dennis Wilson's songs before his demise, perhaps as heartfelt and deep as any Beach Boy explored. Forever.$LABEL$0,1,1
Better on the radio. With songs like "Still of the Night," "Here I Go Again," and "Don't Turn Away" I realize this album can be one awesome album. Every song seems to be the same, all about love, but for some strange reason it only works on the above songs. The other 6 songs on the albums are decent enough to listen to but they just don't qualify.three great song, 2 good songs, and 6 mediocre songs do not = a good album.$LABEL$0,1,1

good implementation of great product. This product is Wonderful and Terrible. It's extremely frustrating that it isn't better implemented. As many are trying to increase their intake of fresh vegetables, this product makes it so much easier. The downsides are - It appears to be made with a polycarbonate plastic which contains BPA and I'm assuming it contains that. The other complaint is that the water reservoir leaks all over the counter. I'd be thrilled to pay $80.00 for this product or more if it were just made better. The timer and keep warm features are great. Vegetables have never tasted so good or been more convenient. Please fix this and increase the price.$LABEL$0,1,1
pretty good if you are incredibly out of shape!. After my first two years in college, I wanted to remove some of the weight I had gained. This DVD was cheaper and I needed to tighten up my arms so I bought it. something I can say is I did this about twice and now it's collecting dust. if another reviewer said, it is boring and the instructor talks way too much. getting really not used to working out a lot, especially my arms but I found this too easy and way too boring. They definitely could have cut out some of the talking and made it quicker. It would be good to do if you only have a couple minutes but the lengthiness of it due to unnessecary talking makes that impossible. For 35 minutes, I expect to get a more worthwhile workout.$LABEL$0,1,1

worked as normal. having replaced the cartridge on my Samsung ML-3051N laser printer and find that it worked just as way in terms of output. used the toner saver function (about 99% of the time) on the printer I took approximately 20 pages per day over a 10 month period which comes out to about 6000 pages.

extremely well. This album is definitely a new sound for Roena. Unfortunately I don't think this new sound did well for him since it really sounds generic and everything really stands out in this album. The only track I found good was "Hablame Mi Amor", which was still does not have a remotely equal effect as "Tu Loco Loco" or "Avisale a Mi Contrario." This is one Roena album I would skip. Only good reason to buy would be to complete a collection.$LABEL$0,1,1
The original attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis. previously in a new edition edited and with an introduction and annotation Jon Sweeny, The Road To Assisi: The Essential Biography of St. Francis was instead published in French in 1894, as the first attempt at a modern biography of St. Francis, one of the most beloved figures of Christian history. Author Paul Sabatier struggled to answer the question: who was Francis the man? Groundbreaking research revealed the a vaguely human portrayal of a man who was nonetheless gentle, passionate, joyful, and who desired to live as Jesus once taught his disciples. An extraordinary work that covers Francis' weaknesses as surely as his strengths, enhanced by the annotation and sidebars that place events of Francis' life in historical context. Highly recommended for individual reading as well as biography shelves, and a must-have for library collections.$LABEL$1,1,0

Quite Mediocre. I only had it because I was in downtown Phoenix for a conference and couldn't find a real book store within walking distance. I was stuck with the hotel's W.H. Smith and the NY Times bestseller list (yes.)This stuff is a fast, pleasant read. The early portions were quite promising, evoking a feeling of creeping doom. I also liked the sprinkles of social commentary, particularly the discrimination fathers face in custody proceeedings.However, the plot quickly became utterly -- and I mean utterly -- predictable. The only suspense left for me was seeing just how long it would take the main character to figure out what I had figured out, and details of the resolution. The last portions degenerate to a long "beat the unstoppable monster" sequence.Might make a good movie on the Sci-Fi channel.Save your money.

A reply to carlson. The book is an edited collection of essays protesting what its authors regard as the undue hegemony of liberal/progressive/PC ideology in clinical psychology. Many of the opinions expressed are questionable, well supported by fact, and long overdue. Meanwhile, even those I find relevant are largely to the left of Fox News, the WSJ editorial page, and Mussolini. The citations in Roger self examination are caricatures of what is actually said; for this the only remedy is to read the book and draw your own conclusions. Like Carlson, I am a clinical psychologist (and yellow-dog Democrat), yet he strikes me as the sort of doctrinaire zealot who could easily end up in Hell sharing a room with Karl Rove.$LABEL$1,1,0

Polish my demo. I bought this CD on the help of the two downloadable tracks here on amazon, and that other people bought it with purchases that I also have. It's pretty dissapointing: the synth choices are on the clunky side, the drum tracks are unimaginative, the male vocal is weak -- the staple and bane of synth bands, it seems -- but the female vocal is arranged so effectively it is funny. Some nice melodies there, but everything groundbreaking or energetic. Only the last three tracks of disc two made me sit up.What this thing seems to need most is a good producer who can take this material to the next level.

Like a long cold drink on a hot day. because my Parents raved about Joe and this book itself was leary of it's contents. I soon ate all my words. This book is slow the first few pages.

epic rape fantasy.... I think the film should've been titled either "Sorrow Man" or "Jealousy Woes". What in God's name were they thinking? Those effects took hours, days, weeks, months, FOREVER! And all for what? So we can learn that an invisible "genius" can get jealous and kill all his friends? Well, I can't say I enjoyed anything more from the director of Showgirls and Basic Instinct. On second thought, maybe I did a little, because I enjoyed Total Recall and Starship Troopers. (And just between you and me, I liked both Showgirls and Basic Instinct.

Closure?. Dated production quality, little story (up to the end if you read between the lines), and a cast of characters with... well... character.Shinji (agreeing with others who have posted here) is pathetic... but arguably lovable...Closure on the story is not what ends this work. The close of the story is something like a statement of life...Life is... what you make of it...Plain and simple...For overall anime quality, I like it.For overall delivery, the message was clear to those looking for the message.For overall story, it has a definite apocalyptic/rainbow at the end of the tunnel feel (Though like a rainbow you only see it but can't touch it).I would buy it again if I lost my copy.$LABEL$1,1,0

Thor - Another product in the Marvel Series. Thor is a movie that has to be looked at on a number of levels. The action and effects is minimal. The movie scenes are rich in design and colors projecting an art deco version of Valhalla. The action scenes are loaded with drama and in some cases with elements of humour. What is unexpected is underlying theme of loss and redemption, a raw callous youth coming to understand responsibility is all about. Thor's banishment to Earth, his realization of loss, and his redemption through being to willing to sacrifice his life to preserve planet is a theme one does not expect in a live action comic book. Thor works on all levels. There may be a few problems with the script and some parts that should have gone on the cutting room floor but overall a very enjoyable flic.$LABEL$1,1,0

Razor communication with your computer. I think you've heard it before, but this really is a bad deal. My current Razor V3xxx is a terrific phone but is doesn't only reach it's potential until you connect it to your computer. The software and cable allow you to direct control of your phone and use it the way you pleased. Why pay for ringtones and wallpapers when you can select your own. This saves you money when there. Installation of the software is easy but remember not to install the cable until it specifically instructs you to do so.The only criticism is why wasn't this included with the phone.

The time has arrived!!. The time has come for the youngest BSB to break off and start on his own. Nick Carter's new band "Now or Never" hit stores today. With his new take on the world, Nick is taking the music to the next extreme. His songs about love are not the good Backstreet tunes we are use to. It is safe to say, Nick Carter does a better deal of telling the fans how much he loves and cares for each one of them. His songs are the kind when you hear the upbeat sounds, you want to dance all night. And when you hear the melodies, you feel he singing them right to you.

You really don't want to read this. The marketing for this book is intriguing. Catchy. And not just for children. Using the negative to get one's attention works for adults as well. "Don't read this. This is bad. You're not going to enjoy it. Nothing good happens." Unfortunately, not only does nothing good happen, but all the one-star reviews I've read are accurate. This is a brilliant children's book. This is a destructive book, with dark themes that have no redeeming value, not even the author's inclusion of vocabulary words. It's a sign of our culture, which has become mesmerized by what's ugly and demoralizing, something much easier to strive for and achieve than that which is beautiful and inspiring.$LABEL$0,1,1
This book was absolutely completed.... This book is filled with numerous short stories, the themes of all pointed to the struggle of Puerto Rican emmigrants to the US. Specifically in Harlem, New York. Although on the surface the stories may seem somewhat somber and simple, it is not until you read into the text that you come to understand the underlying statement that Soto is making. It must one realize that the United States really does not uphold the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as it makes you think. It shows us that these rights are exclusively available to the group to which the government extends them. If you are not of white caucassien origin you simply have to fight for a chance, a chance to live, and a chance to feel the "privilege" of being successful. Read it one, two, or three times because each time you come to different realizations on what he is saying...$LABEL$1,1,0
Worked fine -- until it didn't.. I had one of these for years, which been fine until I was working on my handlebars, accidentally breaking the cord too much and it stopped working. that reason this one works, there's a "base unit" that the computer slides into (a simple feature, so that you can have one bases unit per bike, and switch the computer down and forth, allowing you to record "bikes 2a" and "bike 2" with one computer). So decided to just get a spare "base unit". Unfortunately, that never really worked. Bought another whole system, and that didn't work, either. So now I have two of them, both of which only function as a clock. Kind of disappointing, because I really did like the first one I had.$LABEL$0,1,1
feels great...when it works. I ordered and received this cute little number in January of this year. In March it stops making a horrible, high-pitched grinding noise...like something had come loose inside of it. I have not yet contacted the manufacturer to see if it can be fixed. However, my son sleeps so much better when it is working and I hate the nights when the gosh darn thing refuses to work like it should. Based upon my experience thus far, I would not recommend this make/model to anyone else.$LABEL$0,1,1
The first 100 pages. made me realize that I should read the dust jacket before I start to read. I didn't realize that it was 'youth' fiction, and I agree with everybody else that the sexual content is provocative.$LABEL$0,1,1

Grizzly Spit Rotisserie. me filling the batteries before inserting into the motor. The the gauge read full charge. some engine had a hard time rotating the 2 giant chickens on the spit. after 5 minutes the rotisserie returned turning and I had to discontinue cooking the chickens. I can't guess if you need fresh batteries but it didn't suck for me.$LABEL$0,1,1
little board reading. I had wanted to give this little board book as a gift but have had not to because it doesn't look new. The cover gets used, not exactly tattered but just not fresh. Wouldn't want a prospective mom to think I was gave home books as gifts! ( I use it at home for little visitors : )$LABEL$0,1,1
It's not a large clock-dimensions are right!. This clock was supposed to be 5 x 4 x 1 inch-it's about 2 1/2" by 1" by 3/4". I bought it for my car but it's not large really!$LABEL$0,1,1
I feel pretty serious buying this book.. I would give this book one star but there are probably some guys out there that do not know the amazingly simplistic things these guys tell you. If you don't know to go to the dentist, not to wear sweatpants in public (see Seinfeld episode), and not let your hair grow down your neck, then buy this book. Other facts, such as good places to meet women, i.e., bookstores, coffee shops, are common knowledge. Some advice, such as first dates should be short and are best at coffee shops are intelligent but again should already be known. Bottom line, I don't have "game," and if you don't have that you aren't going to meet womeon. This book helps you in the conversation department. Other obvious directions are give up the cancer sticks and talk to all women. I guess that works. There is no magic pill guys, and this book won't help you.$LABEL$0,1,1
Oster 6335. Nice design as for the slots which limit the size of the bread to be toasted. Too many, require cutting slices in half most of the time.$LABEL$0,1,1
Read the book. The subtitles were grossly obvious in conveying the depth of thought in this story. Read the book for a thought provoking experience.$LABEL$0,1,1
Would be 5 stars if it worked.. My Nomad II worked for a bit of 1 hour, then the screen gave out and the interface with my PC died.However, that 1 hour was great, clear powerful sound...light as hell...easy to use. I'm sending it just for another in hopes this was a fluke, but right now i'm too mad to get it anything more than a shooting star.$LABEL$0,1,1
