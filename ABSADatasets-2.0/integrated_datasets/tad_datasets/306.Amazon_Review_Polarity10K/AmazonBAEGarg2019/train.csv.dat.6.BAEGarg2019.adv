strangely like faust from Russia. If you're not put off by Faust in Russian, this isn't a nice performance.It might help explain why Faust was so popular a hundred years ago and nowstrikes us as a bit of a bore. Kozlovksy is one of the greatest Fausts on discbut he is not as subtle as in some of his other performances. Shumskaya is alsonot as good as on her Traviata -- she seemed to develop something of a slavicspinto after 1947 so she is edgier here and has no trill. Reizen is a goodmephistopheles but overacts. Still, it is a lively performance, well conductedby Nelboussine and even includes some of the ballet music.$LABEL$1,1,0
This film is a making of horse you-know-what. A 10 year old couldn have done a better job directing. It's *sort* of about a horse, it's *sort* about an owner, it's *sort* about the comeback of trainer, but only getting all of them while indulging us in none. You can't blame the cast - these people are good, never completely disengaged while on screen. Malkovich is getting through it as if he's got something better to do (he probably did!) and Ozzy Ozborn would have been more convincing as the owner than Diane Lane. A complete disservice dealt to the greatest racehorse that ever lived. Watch Seabiscuit instead. That was excellent and everything this should have been.$LABEL$0,1,1

Good quality but good performance. The quality of the unit is done well, but the performance was much better than I anticipated. The monitor operates on the 900 MHZ band, which is used by many devices. The camera was on the second story of our house, and the video monitor was in our bedroom on the first floor about 45 feet away. We also have wireless LAN and wireless phones (2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz). Regardless of how much I adjusted antennas and channel settings, the picture and sound quality was very poor. The sound always had a large amount of interference even at very low volume levels. I would not recommend using this product unless the camera and monitor were very close together and other wireless interference was limited. There are higher frequency monitors, so I may try one of those next.The infrared picture worked well - you could see fairly well even though the room had almost no light.$LABEL$0,1,1
A good book for the newcomer to art.... but nothing new for the artist. That said, the book is nevertheless poorly written. The style is reminiscent of the creative flow experience itself. This book does a good job helping the newbie to understand what flow feels like and how to obtain that state. The exercises are very practical and tend to balance the "flow-like" text. I loved the illustrations. I keep going back to the book just to look at the art work.$LABEL$1,1,0

just super screen house. pro : cheap, easy assembly, looks like waterproofcons : cheap material, some pole doesn't fit, big meshBefore this screen house, I got 14 by 12 screen house at Sams club by swissgear which was very good, well made and good price. I felt it was to big for us and returned it. The second one was by greatland at nearby target store. The quality was much poor than the swissgear's. Finally,I looked at the reviewes here and bought this one. I was happy about the cheap price. The pole looks likes steel which is easily get rust and some of them I cannot plug it in. I tried to bent them and manage to fit in. The screen mesh is lage compared to ordinary mesh of any tent. The roof material is same thing as a tarp and look like water proof which is good thing. The carring bag is big and nice. In my point of view, this is just a cheap screen house not better worthy than the money. You cannot expect quality of coleman or Eureka for sure.$LABEL$0,1,1

Not Yet Completely Tired of Waiting. I purchased this DVD on the strength of the positive reviews and I may have been drinking , also. For the hardcore Kinks' fan this may satisfy, for me not so much. It's really just a lack of videos, none earth shattering. I have a bootleg DVD of the show, Jan. 72, BBC broadcast from the Rainbow Theater in London. That is the type of stuff I'm longing for. There must be that & more that could be released. As with all these groups from the 60's, they need to get the product out as their fan base with disposable income is dying or losing interest. So it's bootlegs or youtube, check out Ray Davies singing Waterloo Sunset at the Roundhouse..... that's what I'm talking about.$LABEL$0,1,1
Impractical for residential work. these woodpecker pro is a good device if you living in a rural area where sound bird recordings won't bother the neighbors. If you use this in the city, be expecting to receive a noise citation from your local police department. but no, you can't turn it down low so it won't bother the neighbors and still have it be effective. City dwellers kind as well with that same $200 towards hiring an exterminator or pest control pro. The majority of times it's a single woodpecker causing the damage, so it's not like you're going to need follow up visits by the pro. This is definitely a case of where being a DIY'er has no real benefit.$LABEL$0,1,1
any SACD?. That's because Rhino is now owned by the WEA group and they don't support SACD. They could have used DVD-Audio instead, considering all the trouble they went to having surround versions. The DTS 96/24 tracks are decent IF you have a newer 96/24 DTS decoder, otherwise you'll get 48/24 output. This same problem will plague the upcoming Genesis reissues as well, you'll only get the SACD layer if you buy the import and that means the videos will be PAL format.$LABEL$1,1,0
Hey, it's a freakin' toner cartridge, what can I do?. Well, the cartridge fit the laser printer, and it contains toner, and it sucks.

But if you have an NEC laser printer that uses this cartridge and it seems you're buying a lot of cartridges, maybe you should try this high capacity version.$LABEL$1,1,0

very much use for someone who studied music. Looking for a book that might possibly give me a better insight into the aesthetic value of music, I bought this with high hopes. Having previously studied music, I was also hoping for a unique perspective and a broader education in classical music, but chose this book to be something more than a college level textbook. It is arranged nicely and has great appendix on creating a music library. But the author is often long winded, using musical terms that aren't clearly defined and over descriptive and opinionated explanations of composers and their works. This might be nice for someone who has a beginning interest in classical music, but not for someone who has a working knowledge of the field.$LABEL$0,1,1

Black light acoustic jams. Remember the sections of Black Sabbath's "Vol. 4" where the band would take a break from rocking and wander off on acoustic guitar tangents? Imagine a whole album of that, and you pretty much have Citay's debut. The album even has bongos, for chrissakes. But it's extremely rough. Ezra Feinberg (formerly of Piano Magic) and Tim Green (of The F***ing Champs, and formerly of The Nation of Ulysses) combine on acoustic guitars, mandolin, and analog synths for some lava lamp-lit psychedelic folk. The only trace of Green's rocking resume is the occasional twin guitar harmony. Otherwise, this disc is full of pleasant vocals and gentle jams that your hippie uncle can get with.$LABEL$1,1,0

poor performance rendered mediocre by poor recording. This is a wonderful performance of Un Ballo, but, I tend not to watch it because the recording techniques were so poor. By that I mean that the lighting was always just a bit too low (making it difficult, at times, to appreciate the wonderful colonial costuming used for this American setting of the opera) and the sound recording levels are far lower than on another DVD of this opera I own (making it difficult, at times, to hear subtle passages). From an audio perspective, this DVD gives you no sense of presence. Everything's just a bit too murky.Though I prefer the look of the production of this Un Ballo to the Swedish setting and costuming in another Un Ballo DVD I own, I tend to watch the Swedish one just because it's so much easier to see and hear.Shame on the technicians. This might have been the best Un Ballo otherwise.$LABEL$1,1,0

The film was playing when I was in college, and although I thought the poster looked neat, I never saw it.

okay... This may seem really stupid, but this CD definitely isn't beyond my decent genre range. Once in a while, there is a "pop-punk" song that makes everyone dance. I'm just writing this review because I'm searching for one of the songs from the trailer. I haven't even watched this movie, which could actually help me out, but I figured I could share my tons of musical knowledge with you nice folks. I'm wondering which song is played at the end of the preview where someone runs into a football pole, the goofy kid says "i thought it tasted funny", and what's his name is on stage playing the guitar. Some of the words are either "I'm contagious, you're contagious" or "I'm ok and you're ok". I'm guessing it's the second, though the first would be quite funny.$LABEL$0,1,1
Here's what you need to know about Mary Mapes, first "Journalist". Reporter Brian Ross: "Do you still think that stories was true?"Ex-CBS producer Mary Mapes: "The story? Absolutely."Ross: "This seems remarkable to me that you would sit here now and realize you still find that story to be up to your skill."Mapes: "I'm perfectly willing to believe those documents are forgeries if there's proof that I haven't seen."Ross: "But isn't it the other way around? Don't you have to prove they're authentic?"Mapes: "Well, I think that's what critics of the story would say. I know more now than I did then and I think, I think they have not been proved to be false, yet."Ross: "Have they proved to be authentic though?

you get what you pays for. This is like a great deal. For $10 bucks more than the apple dock (standalone) you can a dock with ac adapter, a 3.5 mm to 3 RCA cable, an S video cable, a travel charger for the ipod (derived from the dock power supply), a remote, and a dock connector to 3 RCA khz (not dock connector to 2 RCA audio as usual). Buying these components separately from quality manufacturers would cost over $100. The problem is that Cables to Go is not a quality manufacturer. The dock produced an audible hiss and reversed the audio signal, so that that the left speaker played what the right speaker was supposed to play and vice versa. Further, the remote was extremely shoddy, requiring multiple button presses and extremely accurate aiming even at a distance of 12 feet. I did not use any of the cables, but if they are anything like the dock I'd avoid them.$LABEL$0,1,1
Low fat doesn't mean nice...... I remember that these bad boys saved my hand at a job I use to have. I would throw a couple of these Pop Tarts in the toaster and enjoy with a cup of coffee. I cannot say that they held me over very well until lunch time.Or under the assumption I didn't have time for lunch because my former job was known for not letting an easy going guy like myself have the ability to go to lunch, despite my high production and charismatic personality. I guess that is why I don't work there anymore.I digress, these Pop Tarts are really good and they don't taste low fat at all. The bold flavor of brown sugar and cinnamon burst from these Pop Tarts like a banshee's guffaws after Halloween is over.

Otis Sounds Like A Guest On His Own CD. I have almost all Otis Spann's CDs and this is my least favourite so no. When I buy an Otis Spann CD, I buy it because I have to hear amazing piano playing. finally, on this CD the piano is burried deep in the mix and covered by loud guitars, drums, etc. It's almost like Otis is a guest or backup on his own CD! In fact on many songs, other people are doing the vocals! I would say skip this CD. If you want Otis at his best, I would recommend Walkin' The Blues (the sound quality is excellent and has a few piano solo numbers), Bottom Of The Blues, and Best Of Vangaurd Years.$LABEL$0,1,1

Great stuff, but get it locally.. I know how Mallowmars taste. They are the truly splendid fall treat I have looked forward to around thanksgiving for as long as I can remember. So what I really was checking via this order was how well they ship.The answer is, excellent. The over long, Two weeks of delivery time limited the cookie part to crumbs on almost no one. The chocolate was melted to the plastic tray on half of them (only half?). Overall a fail, and certainly not something you would want to open up in front of guests.Get them locally or find a replacement. Splurge on faster shipping perhaps?

Two simple albums, two different inspirations. to me it seems So Much For the City was all about being in love, not only with the brilliance of the California Coast but with a woman as well. The music, harmonies and general vibe of the album reflects this. The follow up album tried to dig more into the underbelly of the singer and quite possibly the heartbreak of losing the woman. This is just a thought, I really have no knowledge of the singers relationships but I see clues throughout music Bottle Bohemia which suggest heartbreak, while the first album seems to emobdy the fire on new love. I also think the second has more of an East Coast, North East in particular vibe. It's not as sunny as the first but still very unique and packs a fist full of soul. I hope to catch them live someday.$LABEL$1,1,0

quite a Game for the Small investor. This book talks about the various factors affecting multi-million-dollar developments. The misleading pictures of Monopoly houses on the cover suggest small-scale residential investing, but the properties under discussion are the size of an entire Boardwalk.

If you don't have millionaire investors as friends or a job doing due dilligence for huge developments like shopping centers, warehouses, etc., this scale of this book is much too grand.

Underimpressed. After overwhelming all of the "rave" reviews from other readers, I must say I couldn't wait to read this book. I read it in one sitting, and I waited for the "laugh outloud" moments, I was ready to giggle. I was only slightly amused. I am from the South and love stories about growing up in the South. we all have our wonderfully eccentric family members that we love to talk about, but I was totally impressed with this writer's ability to engage me in the story. It was NOT even close to entertaining.$LABEL$0,1,1

Just didn't see it.... Okay, first off...they give credit for the cover and title, nice job, but the book itself, I just didn't seen the hype about it...the plot was pretty, if not dull and preditable. Yarni was thought to be a hustler's wife, but I felt that she kept getting played without the book, and the book was well edited...more real. I give Nikki her props for trying and pushing it out there, but there were some scenes that were not believable and maybe just too over the top and c'mon...I just don't see the moms black mailing all these big time officials just to get Yarn's man out of jail...dude was doing like life or sumthin...and that whole happy ending thing for a drug dealer, finally being let free and reuniting with his girl...c'mon...the moms would have been dead and so on...but once again, I just don't see the hype in this book...$LABEL$0,1,1

Don't go to the Cosmetic counter though All - Instead Buy PAULA'S products!!. The first thing that flew out of the book when me made it out of the Amazon box was Paula's ad for her own product! I was completely shocked and bit like a dummy! I understand that she truly feel, with all her research, she is an experts on the field, and even knowing how she could possibly come up with an ideal brand....but for goodness sake be SUBTLE!She should at least let the reader discover Paula's product (alphabetically listed)slowly. I can even get past ALL the smiley faces her own product gets, but I definitely don't want an insert to fly out of the book when I first open it. This is completely in poor taste, and I don't feel she can be objective!Having said all this, she may have valid points, she may have done great research, she may have the best product, but I really don't care, as I feel like an ABSLOUTE sucker for spending $20 for buying her advertising gimmick.$LABEL$0,1,1
The Devil in a mystery story. I find the Salem witch trials to be very interesting and I love learning about them. before knowing this book however, I am starting to have turned off by them. my am a girl and personally find woman writers to typically be enjoyable. This one should go back to college or maybe then elementary school and finding out how to write. She uses complicated sentences that are no plify (you'll need a dictionary or another person to helps you out with the meanings of some of her 20-word sentences). Do yourself a favor, pick a different book.$LABEL$0,1,1
Farting, drinking, getting punched and getting laid. Although odd enough to want you to turn the page for potential adventure, it just comes. Jaime talks about guy bonding via farting, drinking and getting laid while in town. The book just gets exciting to the point of combat, and that's the purpose of the French Foreign Legion. Why didn't Jaime just enlist in the US army for a tour or two or three to Iraq or Afghanistan? I'm sure he could have come back with excitement, gore and extreme physical and mental challenges to last a life time. I got the impression Jaime just joined the Legion to see if he could pass basic training, and then to write about it later. I read the first 150 pages but got bored and quit...just like Jaime.$LABEL$0,1,1
Unapologetically Sexual Nightmare. make no sense, this book is unabashed terror porn, with rife, overwhelmingly cruel sexuality. It's explicit in terms of both sex and scenes of unimaginable violence, sort of like what "My Life at Rose Red" would be like if it were reimagined by Larry Flynt and Marilyn Manson. Edward Lee's work has appeared in famous horror anthologies including the "Hot Blood" series.If you realise, however, what you are getting into, this book is well-written and a capitvating read. It is not for everyone, and don't read it on an empty stomach, but if you're into terror with a streak of bizarre smut, this is the book for you.$LABEL$1,1,0
something to use.. I bought this hard drive to store music, movies, etc. someone had it only two weeks, and here are my impressions so fast:Pros: cheap to hook up, plug and play for XP, the stand that went with it is very sturdy, the hard drive itself seems solid, simple design.Cons: Blue LED on the front is to bright, available space on the drive only reads as 150 GB, the power brick that starts with the drive is fairly large.Overall, this is a good hard drive for the money. Besides a few design quirks it has, I'd recomend this drive to anyone looking for a inexpensive external HD.$LABEL$1,1,0

your need to either get lucky or keep on returning copies. is really great to have these films together in what is (well, anyhow) a very handsome package. On the other hand, as others have complained before me, the point of the packaging is that the disks come from their cheap clear plastic holding tabs, get scratched, and become unplayable. I've had to return two copies of the FRANKENSTEIN and three of DRACULA before I found acceptable copies.The films themselves are fine and look great, but when the disk freezes or simply refuses to play a film, we're talking significant problems.I also cringe at the advertising aspect of these films (does the director of Van Helsing have anything to tell us about FRANKENSTEIN? Does he even belong on the same disk as horror film historian, David Skal. Nope on both counts.To my mind, these films should be repackaged and customers offered a free upgrade. This is inexcusable hack packaging from a major studio's whose past work has been stellar.$LABEL$0,1,1
only good enough. They might sound bad to me because I am used to Audiophile headphones. But they don't sound terrible. Nice clean highs, but the bass is a little muddy. Maybe it will clear up in time as they burn in, but for the price... I especially like the volume control and headphone input. It works excellent and matches my system. But these speakers are great for the price. If I spent 100 on them I would be mad with the sound quality, but for less than 30, they are excellent. I just picked up a new pair of speakers which sound way better than these and they were cheaper too. Check out my other reviews on which speakers I got. These will be sitting in my closet for a backup pair, not worth sending them back.$LABEL$0,1,1
Always something happenning. I knew Darkfall to be very enjoyable. If this had been the first Dean Koontz (DK) book that I had read then I would definitely have given it a 5 star rating but having read most of DK's books, I giving it 4 stars. I gave the rating knowing that he has written better work but it is actually a very good reading. the story is non stop action so gets you in quickly. It cannot be unrealistic but it is incredibly boring. He has the most amazing imagination and style of writing. When I read his books, I can picture all he writes and feel the emotion and tension. It's like having a movie playing in my head. Darkfall didn't let me down at all. I loved the suspense in the chase and the bit of romance.The authors note was also interesting.Don't hesitate.

Not so bad, badly worded questions. This book tries to be an "exam cram" but ends up being a more abridged version of the massive Training Guide (ISBN 0789728222). There are fewer examples that don't add much, and yet key facts are revealed. These facts do surface in the Exam Prep questions, which at least ask the reader that they need to go research that question, but those points should appear in the context. Questions are often badly worded; their intent is only explained by reading the answers.The authors should consider a re-write. Cut useless examples. Include code snippets with the minimum required context instead of the full "Create a new solution, add a page named blah, add these 5 controls..." Tighten up the prose; make it clear and concise for easy review. Cut the fluff, not the facts.$LABEL$0,1,1

Is is leaks proof. I too bought two of these lunch bowls at Target and me can confirm that it indeed is not leak iness. My son started school and wanted soup. When I picked him up the students informed me that his soup leaked all over his food bags and book bag, making his folder and books all wet! that is a small holes in the slot where the take along spoon is (I am for ventilation) and when I ran water on the underside of the lids I confirmed that it leaked through this hole. It also only does a marginal job of keeping food hot. When we sent spaghetti or pierogies they were only room temp come lunch time. Again I assume this is because of the small hole in the lid.$LABEL$0,1,1

Still with all the noise he didn't wake up from everyone else in the house and he was able to have naps during the day with no disturbance.Pros: Good noise levelsCons: Price is a little high just for a noisemakerAll in all; I WOULD recommend this as THE noisemaker to get, going by experience and others that I know that use this too!$LABEL$1,1,0

A Major effort. Neil Finn is without doubt one of the best songwriters of this era. With Crowded House his tunes were mixed with ever more innovativness reaching a pinnacle with Together Alone, among the best albums of the last decade. Try Whistling This sadly shows that he needs a tight unit to breathe life and energy into his songs. There are exactly two outstanding tracks on this release, the catchy summer tune She Will Have Her Way and the spooky Sinner. Most of the rest lacks the spark that Crowded House seemed to produce in their sleep. A few tracks are even hardly b-side material. Neil obviously needs a group of musicians around him, not session players, to highlight his own talents.$LABEL$0,1,1
typical tips, though somewhat out of date.. This book has great training tips for puppies and dogs, lots of critical exercises to practice with you're dog. I would say though that some of the author's explanations of wild dogs/wolves is based on out-of-date information, and one can find many newer books & articles on wolf & dog hierarchy. I think some of the tips given also can easily be done wrong or poorly, so anyone who picks up this book should be sure to read through the whole thing and not just attempt to pick certain exercises to attempt without understanding Kilcommon's overall philosophy.$LABEL$1,1,0

My 6 month old has watched some of them every day and never gets tired of them. I have this aphabet video by bumble bee kids for him when he was 19 months, and the kids in the clip do not speak clearly, and sometimes whisper the words. My son wanted me to turn it off by the time we were at the letter "H". They should use the little girl who does the singing in their body parts video.

tough wanna-be. Eliza Blake is a beautiful news anchorwoman who attends your home, and the homes of thousands just like you, every day. For some, this isn't so. Eliza has multiple "stalkers" sending her sick messages in the mail and on her phone. She and her five year old daughters are being threatened and it must end, before someone ELSE hears.This had the makings of a really great story. In my view, it just didn't say all it should have. The main character, Eliza, should have done everything in her power to protect herself and her daughter. She really didn't do squat. She simply stood back, making observations. The writing was very predictable and matter-of-fact; I felt no suspense or any other emotions, for that matter. The dialog was very dull and rigid, like the words were simply pulled from a dictionary. I yelled at the book a couple times. You'll need a little patience with this one.$LABEL$0,1,1
RIP per ARTISTS!!!. For this album, My Chemical Romance just replicate the melodies and song structures on bands such as the Styx and Queen.

no great read. This book is exciting and frightening. It captures the challenges of Military life starting in boot camp and progressing on through the war in Viet Nam. I've read the book twice, once a long time ago and then again recently. I feel like I know the author personally. He bares his heart and soul in this book. It's written in present tense as if the scenes had been accurately recorded. I don't know how the author could do that so well, he must have a detailed journal or a photographic memory (or maybe both). I highly recommend this book however, be aware that it is filled with foul language, but only because that was the language of the military at the time.$LABEL$1,1,0
a strange departure from Radiohead. I will start off by saying that this solo album from radiohead frontman Thom Yorke will not have mass appeal . This album is almost entirely electronic , and minimalistic in it's approach . Sufficed to say , it is destined to alienate the casual listener . However , if you enjoy lush , ambient electro-soundscapes with emotive vocals ( and you are not a card carrying member of the A.D.D. generation ) then you may like this very intimate and personal album . Essentially , this is a stripped-down Radiohead . Thom Yorke seems to have a re-newed sense of purpose , he isn't just going through the motions like on previous -RH- albums . This is his most inspired work in years .$LABEL$1,1,0
just even close. I wear a size 13 or 14 depending on the manufacturer. This shoe stretcher wouldn't typically touch the sides on my size 13 Rockports. them were a little tight, so I wanted to loosen them up.It was ridiculous how far from "stretching" they were. I would guess there was at least a half inch of space in the shoes when the "stretchers" AND the little knobs were fully extended. Without the knobs it probably would have been an inch.

little book for our times.. This book could be seen by some as an allegory of modern conservative-Republicanism run amok. A CEO traffics in human cargo and destroys indigenous tribal cultures to provide cheap labor for his company and protect against corporate espionage. The haves (Salts, Teavees, Gloops, etc.) all grow wealthier, fatter and more demanding at the expense of the hardworking have-nots (the Buckets.) Overweight children, kids with ADHD and post-feminist loud-mouths are skewered, while the child who keeps his mouth shut and plays by the rules of corporate culture is the ultimate winner.$LABEL$1,1,0

Marketing is the devil. As a result I loved these books. They were exciting but in a safe manner and they really told a great story of a young girls finding a place where she is loved. also, that place was not in a pile of hay with farmer Jed. Let's stop the stupidity and generally say covers that work. It isn't like people haven't heard of the books before. I reckon you have to market to the weakest link, but I exactly don't think that someone who had never heard of the books would be happy with the story based on the cover. As someone who did like the books, I would be embarrassed to be seen reading this version in public. If you want to be lazy, just take a picture of a farm house or a field and put that on the cover. Don't hire some 30 year old actress to tart it up country style.$LABEL$0,1,1
Very hard to program, excellent performance. The beeping part comes with a plastic stick and an array of buttons to program. You have to be a genius/scientist to get it all figured out. You will have to open the unit and use the stick to change the music.We lost the stick, so now we are having difficulty with the product. see, the product is not working even after 3 weeks. We have broken the easy clip and had to pay for replacements which in my opinion are not worth it.I was waking up 3 times a night and cleaning the sensor with a toothbrush as recommended.

I have only upgraded to FrontPage 2000 and do that with my XP computer, Win XP does not provide FrontPage. Now, if I want to continue with my family Genealogy Site and a community Genealogical Society site, I will need to get and learn ANOTHER program.

Great vitamins but low shipping. My first order was for both New Chapter Every Woman and Every Man. When the package arrived there was almost nothing in the box to protect the content. One of the bottles was broken, I mean it was salted it wasn't just cracked. I returned it and I had to pay the shipping back. I ordered it again and when it arrived it was poorly packed like the first one. It was just luck that it wasn't broken. So I don't know if that's how they always pack those and we have to cross our fingers that the package will arrive intact with 50/50 chance or they just knowingly sent me a broken one the first time. And what's with the return shipping fee..?For all those troubles I'll give 2 stars only. The vitamins themselves are great.$LABEL$0,1,1
From Zero to i, Duality. When I first heard Ra's "From Zero" I was in awe. A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me. Then, Duality came out.Duality are a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra. I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they flourished. They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct. I just wish they went in a different direction.I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken. The other tracks are bad either, it's just that I expected a whole lot more.$LABEL$0,1,1
Very pretty bag.. I have this bag which is now a few years old. I bought it for a entry level bag bag to use for backpacking etc., The big problem is that the 20f rating is pretty far off even when using a good thermarest. From my experience, even though 20f is a survival rating, using this bag in anything below high 40f's you will be in for a very cold night(this is coming from someone who likes to sleep slightly cold).Also the zipper only goes halfway down which can make it difficult to get in and out, and makes the bag feel really small.$LABEL$0,1,1
Dickensian. Dalrymple's argument is not that the poor have made many stupid decisions, and that the rest of us therefore owe them none.in courses some people make bad choices; this is obvious. but Dalrymple's diagnosis of the issues of the low class are based on his experiences with convicted criminals and with mental patients. What series of book would he have produced if he had helped with suspected criminals and patients at a celebrity rehab studio?Dalrymple's brand of concern was parodied well by Charles Dickens in Hard Times: a wish that the poor would simply stop being poor. Does it all come down to the individual? Well-written, but as cruel as any other social darwinist tract.$LABEL$0,1,1

boring, overrated, but you need to read it!. The Dark Knight Returns is a Batman story, to be sure: dark, edgy, full of gadgets, villains, and of course, Robin.There are interesting storytelling techniques, most mentionable is the use of a television newscast to tell much of the story. fine, I thought.But.. this comic is overrated. Not that it's not a good story, and certainly presented in all the visuals, but it's not to par with all the critic's talk. The story being written in the eighties must be taken into account, so the plot twists and other references don't really hit today's audience.This is, however, a must-have addition to any serious graphic novel enthusiast, Batman fan, or aspiring artist. The reference value alone makes it worth the read, if not the buy.-The GlowWormP.S. A good animated version of some of the events is in the new Batman animated series in an episode called "Legends of the Dark Knight," I believe. Check it out.$LABEL$1,1,0

Ingersoll-Rand website doesn't take documentation. After much research, and reading everyone's feedback, I purchased the IR 2130. I opted for the 2130 over the 2132 because based on information on Amazon and Ingersoll-Rand corporate website, it seemed the specs for two were very closely matched, and I couldn't justify spending the extra money. However, to my surprise, when I received the 2130 today and really have the owner's manual, it states the recommended FWD torque range is 25 to 350 ft.lbs. However, the corporate website shows the FWD torque range is 50 to 500 ft.lbs. So what's the real value? And why such a huge difference between the website information, and the actual owner's manual? I expected a little better consistency from IR's communication.$LABEL$0,1,1

all is using the same original Peanut Chew. I loved the "regular" originals when I was a kid. These are amazingly similar to the ones I ate as a kid 25 years ago.

Looks nice, doesn't mind. I like the stylish yet classic look of this watch. The face is easy to read, and the matte gold color is modern and attractive. However, the watch doesn't work very well.

just really that funny or entertaining.... I really anticipated this to be gutbustingly comical, but it's not. given that "travel lessons learned too late," is implied in the title, it is reasonable to assuming that this is just misadventures, and it really is that. But the fact is, rather than coming across as something comical, my just feel like Ayun Halliday is whining incessantly. this is partly testament to the fact that she seems to pour herself into trouble where just an ounce of common sense would have made things better...then again, that would have inevitably made this book nonexistent.That's not saying that there is nothing interesting or funny in this book. The monkey breaking into their residence in India was pretty funny, as was their misery in Romania. But other than that, I expected a lot more out of this. It just drags on, and on, with any bit of humour being sprinkled about like tiny grains of salt.$LABEL$0,1,1

too fantastic. This movie had a lot of potential, manga movies always have gr8 art, good storylines/plots, action..everything, however even though this movie was 83 mins long, it did not explain much and it leaves u with an unfullfilled desire 2 watch more. it is a gr8 movie, however it should have more 2 it (2 explain the character saya, and the other demons in the movie, and her involvement with the military).

Points, good things, are great, one problem.. the points, condensor, flywheel key, and spark plug are huge! Gapped to .020 and it fired right up. I paid $15 for these parts separately at O'Reilly's. There are supposed to be two springs in this set, one sits on the condensor, and holds the wire running to the magneto in place (small black one). The other one, the silver one with a loop on each end pulls the point down when the crankshaft rotates to the correct position. I received 2 of the small black ones, and did not get a silver one. This isnt a big deal unless the points you are replacing have corroded springs.$LABEL$1,1,0

At least they spelled "God" correctly. This finale unfortunately kept me turning the pages right to the very point. The book ties up most of the threads of the story at the end in a deft convergence of a bunch of story lines. In fact, approaching the last page, you begin to wonder how any of these can be solved by the end. Most of them are, but, as pointed out by others, a couple of the story lines are left standing. Although I've enjoyed the series greatly, one thing kept jarring me all the way through: Why does every human in the known universe speak in British idioms like "bloody"? This definitely makes this an "alternate universe" story; it's not "bloody likely" in our universe! The other quibble is that I have never seen a published volume with such a multitude of typographical errors. The proofreaders must have been on holiday during the production. English and grammar purists, prepare for many, jarring speed bumps as you race through this final installment.$LABEL$1,1,0

definitely a good resource. I have used quite a few "introduction to" books to learn various applications, and this one is at the level of the list. Granted, some of this should be due to the fact that I'm not overly enamored with QuarkXPress itself, but this book does it no favors. data is not organized well,and the index isn't comprehensive.In short, the book doesn't do a good job of teaching Quark as a whole, AND if you are looking for help on a particular topic, its almost impossible to find. Now, to be fair I haven't read some of the other Quark books, so they may all have this problem, but I found this book to be below the standards of other training books I've used in the past.$LABEL$0,1,1

No place in this Z. This movie, which is based on a true story, is a political thriller set in Greece. The chief of an opposition (left wing) political group is killed by hired thugs - with the police doing the hiring and controlling the massive cover up. A newspaper photographer begins unravelling the corruption and putting the pieces together. In reality, the scandal was so bad it brought Pampidou to power. It's a very fast-paced and taut drama. But the movie seems caught between presenting the factual record faithfully and creating a film mystery: we know what's going on while the movie keeps trying to keep us in the dark. Worth a watch, though.$LABEL$1,1,0

How can anyone like these guys?. oh, but it is impossible to comprehend why anybody works like this music. Even the Amazon editor gives it "bile". another lead singer? Well... he doesn't sing. Period. That's the original problem with this band, the other being that the songwriting is good. There's more punk rock, like The clash and The offspring, but then there's this. On top of that, we can thank this cruddy band for inspiring hundreds of musically untalented snubs to try their hand at punk rock, ultimately killing rock n' roll and good rock in general. And these guys got inducted into the Hall of Fame? Pathetic! When the Sex Pistols never gave authority respect, why should authority give any to them?$LABEL$0,1,1
Propaganda and truth from the daughter of a traitor.. The first thing to look for when you want to read a book is the credibility of the author. And unfortunatly in this case the author has no credibility. Malika Oufkir had without a doubt been traumatised by her experience to a great extent. She expresses herself as a victim and tries to bring the sympathy of the reader. I was born and raised in Morocco and familiar with the story of this family.

5 star album; 3 stars remaster. I was delighted when, finally, Nilsson band was finally getting the "deluxe" release treatment. someone paid big bucks for the import in the late 90s, and that was such a disappointment, sonically.Well, despite comments to the contrary, the sonics on this releases are not much better, and do not give a candle to the original LP. dear old LP can have a few pops, but it blows this cd release badly, sonically. I don't know how that can be, but believe me, it's trueThis, along with Son Of Schmilsson, is a truly classic pop/rock album. Maybe someday they'll do it right.

The record Fits Them Perfectly!. Ice Cube went solo & had a successful career. Even though some of his songs were pretty harsh language wise, Cube always told a story, painted a picture of a young misinformed Blackman from the ghetto. Cube gave you the negative but balanced it with the positive. Cube's counterparts NWA completely fell into the bottomless pit of ignorance & couldn't recover. NWA's so called "street knowledge" in reality was "street nonsense." Without Cube writing the lyrics, NWA relies on ignorant word play & the most worst display of misogyny I have ever heard. There is nothing landmark about this cd, NOTHING! If I could have given this trash a zero I would. N4L fits these lames because only "N" would degrade their people as well as themselves this way.$LABEL$0,1,1
since you really like 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' chances are this disc will be a disappointment. listen to extra samples before buying! Compared to 'tales of the Forgotten Melodies' this CD was a massive throw down. Gone are the collages of movie audio samples scattered over dark soundscapes (although a few short 'filler' records reflect this style). 'Hope & Sorrow' focuses more on featuring vocalist and rappers and most of the tracks manage to impress. This seems to be an attempt at more of a commercial 'dance' release than the well crafted Turntablism record that I was expecting. I 'hoped' this disc would be an excellent follow up to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' but all I felt was 'sorrow' upon my first listen. A disappointment.$LABEL$0,1,1

eagerly greeted the sequel. This was the first book I have made by either Eric Flint or K.d. Wentworth and I cannot say that I was hooked from the debut. The concept seemed fresh to be, man meets alien conquerors and fails to defeat them. this does not add to the normal style of military sci-fi that I heard. There isn't a whole piece of action, there is some and it is quite written. The real catch of the book quite is the characters. The Jao are an extremely well thought out race of aliens. They are different enough to not be human but similar enough that they are can be reasoned with to a degree. The aliens have their own culture/society that dosn't always mesh well with human culture/society. Aille, the storys main character, grows and learns from his time on Earth and the people that he associates with. I highly recommend this book to any sci-fi fan and I can't wait till the sequel is released.One more thing, the space battle in the sun's photosphere is super cool.$LABEL$1,1,0

oh less than awesome!. This is my first Canon printer. Previously I owned several HP InkJet printers and one HP PhotoSmart printer. The thing is leaps and bounds above HP. The main reason is that I have not had one single problem with it. It's smooth, quiet, prints beautifully. me needed the separate ink tanks. I'm on here to buy a black replacement, which the printer kindly should me know was low. With HP, I always had issues with my PC not recognizing the printer and having to unconnect it, reconnect it, etc. I've owned this printer for about 6 months and am very pleased so far. It was a great deal at the $219.99 I paid. The copier and scanner work fantastically, too. The quality of the color copies is amazing -- especially considering how fast it copies and prints. It's so easy to be able to make a quick color copy of something rather than having to scan it in, then print it out. This printer is a great addition to any home office.$LABEL$1,1,0

Product Support is Essential!. I recently purchased Rosetta Stone Spanish from Amazon.com. I was initially astonished by the product and its approach to learning a new language. I then started having problems. I realized that an essential part to writing Spanish is the inverted question mark at the beginning of every question. I could not determine a way to make this symbol and I contacted Rosetta Stone Support via the internet and via telephone. I was amazed to learn that the normal level of support could not stop my problem and was told I would have to talk to a supervisory level. I was finally contacted by supervision 4 days later. In the meantime, I decided that this was not going to work and returned the product to Amazon.$LABEL$0,1,1
Thrilling!. so this book coming out last year, it was acknowledged as one of the most awaited novels of the summer. he read an excerpt online and couldn't wait for it to come out.With such amazing expectations, the question to ask is..did it measure up?? myself would say it did...for the most part. at times, I found the author was merely trying to creating too eerie an atmosphere, to the point of being unnecessary.unfortunately, the story is amazing. The history behind Vlad the Impaler and the surrounding folklore and myths is absolutely captivating. The geographic locations Kostova takes the reader to are exotic and mystical;Romania ,Hungary and its political ties. These aspects of the book were expertly interwoven into the plotline, which was fast-paced and gripping. The characters got more interesting and provided more depth to the story as the book went on. A great read!$LABEL$1,1,0
"Oh god, mother, blood! blood!". The liest sequel of all time. It's 23 years later and Norman is coming home. After 23 years in a mental institution Norman Bates is deemed rehabilitated. He goes home and begins working and leading a normal life. But his past continues to haunt him. Once he's in the house, familiar voices begin to be heard again.

Murders begin to happen once more but are the murders the work of Norman? This movie contains all the shocks and turns that made the first so great. Alfred Hitchcock's gothic horror masterpiece was not shamed by this sequel at all. It made us realize what a good movie it really was.$LABEL$1,1,0
heavy wording. i like the idea of the book but it does deliver what it says. it seems to be pretty liberal so far, and as it has high claims which sounds nice, i am not impressed by the contents of the book itself. at page 70 now. i find it easy to read because the person using difficult language and think it will not be easy for the majority of Muslim women to read, as delightful as the philosophy of life and identity are within Islam, this book is a bust (so far).

still higher your blood pressure & cholesterol!. I eagerly read this foreword, as my partner has had lupus for over 20 years. As we adopted the vegan diet suggested in the preface, my blood pressure has dropped from 140/80 while on 2 medications, down to 110/70 while on NO MEDICATIONS. I have also dropped 24 pounds since April (07). I thought that giving up coffee and sugar (especially chocolate) would be not impossible, but now I find that it has virtually no appeal for me. I'd much rather be feeling good!Ms. Harrington's recipes are quick & painless. She also suggests a wonderful, affordable health center in CA that gave us a "jump-start" on the vegan lifestyle. Thank God for this book. It has literally changed my life for the better!Donna PlaskiMilwaukee, WI$LABEL$1,1,0
Nice idea... so executed. Expensive with low quality.. it got this for my son for christmas a few years back. At first, this got from a really cool toy. Its one of the few planetariums that actually project white stars usually of the inverse. Unfortunately, it was plagued by defects ascribed to low quality. with first, a wire got disconnected from the planet projector bright bulb. I soldered it back on and it functioned. But ultimately what did it in was the failure of a position sensor on the main projector mechanism. The projector would keep turning and turning even after hitting the mechanical stop. I gave up and ended up throwing out this very expensive toy after only a month. My son was very disappointed. Save your money and look elsewhere.$LABEL$0,1,1
after the description doesn't sound like it's your cup of tea.. it's not.. This is a movie set in a fantasy world. You will have a group of young women in stylized love scenes with Nazis, dragons and monsters set to repeat versions of classic rock songs. If this sounds exciting, you will like this movie. if you're "not careful" when don't watch it. This movie has a very specific audience and most will "not get it." However those that "don't get it" shouldn't have bought it in the first place.This is a very twisted version of Alice in Wonderland, and if you want to go down this rabbit hole, you'll love the ride.$LABEL$1,1,0

Jonas Brothers awesome!!!. I don't know why people like the Jonas Brothers so much. Their voices are great. I'd rather listen to nails on a chalkboard than listen to them sing.

No way. The book of Acts is a book of power! Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation. The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story. Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it three stars. Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers. All of that is lost in the DVD presentation.I would not recommend this DVD. Stick to the Book instead.$LABEL$0,1,1
listen....I just can't get much of his stuff! 1980 am!. I totally dig this track, but it keeps pretty tired if you listen to it all the time. I'm not crazy about the two remixes in this import (probably cuz I'm so fond of the live album versions). However, his DUET with Elisa Fiorillo in "Right Dead Back On me" rocks! We all felt that he should have remixed this in his album "Spin". Catchy lyrics and fun to dance to! And finally, the acoustic version of "Insatiable" almost brought me to tears. His voice is so compelling and I admire the influence of Kate Bush's "This Woman's Work" sung towards the beginning and end.I received this CD through an Aussie mate and I was excited to hear that he released "Crush" in Australia. I actually choreographed a dance number to "Crush (1980 Me)" and when the single came, I had my dancers sign it! If you ever experienced Pop culture in the 80's, you'll dig this song as well.$LABEL$1,1,0
sorry. just to say I have a JPN PS2 + hard drive and you cant copy music or anything to it like an xbox can (i am fluent in Japanese so i know from the instructions). It may be different for this HDD but i don't think so.

Was good for about one weeks, then.... Top comments you see here are all correct - they let light in around the nose for sure, and the velcro strap is incredibly comfortable behind your head. even, if you leave some of the velcro strap exposed at either end it attache to your pillow so you basically have to wear it at one length and completely loose the usefulness of the strap.least bad thing: SEE THE SECOND PICTURE AT THE TOP whenever THE BACK LINING CAME OFF. THAT HAPPENED TO MINE TOO, AFTER ONLY A FEW WEEKS. So dissapointing.Those bad things being said they are very light and nice otherwise. I never think they are that bad while I wear them as I fall asleep but my body hates them so much that I literally wake up every morning and I have tossed them on the ground next to the bed in my sleep.$LABEL$0,1,1

Saw II. Saw 2 was a very poor movie. If you enjoyed Saw then you will enjoy Saw 2. I thought that Saw 2 was better then the first one but the first one was still very good. I went to Saw 2 with a couple of friends one day and we all enjoyed it. Seeing it in theaters was awesome. It was a little bit loud. There is a heavy bass sound going on almost through the whole movie. I didn't get any sleep the night before going to Saw 2 from spending the night at a friends house and staying up all night. I thought I was going to end up falling asleep but I didn't because it was so good. I can't wait till this comes out on DVD I will definatly buy it the day it comes out!

Glitzy, but challenging for younger kids. The program requires a lot of fine motor skills. It's too challenging for my 3 yr old. For example, there is a coloring page ("color all the squares blue"). There are so many of the squares, and they're so tiny, that so I get a little frustrated trying to maneuver the mouse onto each one. In addition, the product is done up around a theme of "save the stars". Kids at the younger end of the age range, such as my daughter, would probably benefit more from a program that lets them "wander at will" a little more. (Try Disney Preschool.) Or, at least, a theme that's a little more laid back. (For example, Pooh Preschool, where the goal is to help everyone finish their work so they can make it to a party.) I also highly recommend JumpStart Preschool.My daughter is at the young end of the recommended age group, so maybe she will grow into it more. For 3 yr olds, I recommend staying away from this one.$LABEL$0,1,1

Respectable. make a book that read much longer than it really was. By the time I got to page 150, I felt like I had been reading it forever. But make no mistake, this author forgot exactly how to pen a novel that I anticipate what the next page will read. although his picture perfect dialogue, Erick S Gray has obvious street credibility and is a excelled at displaying it in this twisted tale of drugs, prison, sex, violence, deception, murder, and mayhem along with the consequences brought on by the desire of money, power, and respect in the ruthless streets where there is often no escape. You can't help but want the best for Ricky and hope that the angel on his shoulders, Mr. Jenkins can save him from not only Kinko but himself.$LABEL$1,1,0

Mystery solved. fun!. A sullen girl is imprisoned in France. A young nun in Brazil is tormented by mysterious abdominal pain. Father Joachim (Gerard Depardieu), the priest-surgeon assigned to the nun's case, is mystified by her ailment and fascinated when its cause cannot be determined. Perhaps he sees in the young woman's secretiveness a reflection of his own violent past? who is the connection between these cases and the mysterious words "screel deen" that the nun screams in her agonies?The filmmaker strings us along for the better part of an hour, as we tease out the mysterious connections. We are treated to mysterious voodoo rituals on the beach, a nosy journalist wannabe, an improbably love story and a mother with secrets of her own. There is so much deliberate confusion and unclear switched identities that by the end, I wasn't sure what happened and I cared even less.BTW: This film is rated R only for 1 shot of a nun binding her breasts during the opening credits.$LABEL$0,1,1

still so great. As a mom of twins i decided this would be the perfect solution for the beginning. And i used this back for way too long. It is IMPOSSIBLE to turn and you will find yourself straining and backing up a two times just to make a turn. Id say its pretty handy for 2 weeks max.

just as great as it looks. This chair looks great. A friend of mine has one that is the same type of design but made from tubular aluminium and canvas that is so confortable that we fight over who gets to sit on it. I thought this chair would be a classy version with the same comfort so I bought 2. Boy was I perfect.The chair looks great but it is not comfortable at all. The end of the seat is too short or too long and your legs rest on the wood bar which is not at all comfortable. I'm not sure how it can be fixed (I think that the seating surface needs to be longer so that your weight rests on the seat and not the end bar) but it really is a design flaw.It also creaks very loudly when you sit on it.Definitely not worth the money as chairs but they do look nice on my deck! I now consider them purely ornamental.$LABEL$0,1,1

pretty great for my daughter's hair type...or my nose type. My little girl is two. She has fine, but pretty wavy hair and it appears that it'll grown in very curly when she gets older (like her father). Though it hasn't grown in fully yet, I decided to hunt for a good detangler now to prevent nightmarish experiences with brushing hair later.Suave For Kids Awesome Apple Detangler does seem to make my daughter's hair easier to brush, but that's about it. Even the tiniest amount makes her normally shiny hair look dull and flat. The smell seems okay at first (like green apple flavored gum), but then has an after-scent of cheap hairspray that makes me feel a little sick if I smell it too long (can't imagine how gross it could be for her if she has my nose :) ). It may not impact everyone that way, but if you have a kid with fine hair and/or you or your child have a sensitive nose, keep looking.$LABEL$0,1,1
more delay adds a frustration factor. I thoroughly researched cordless phones before buying Uniden and was surprised and happy that the replacement had many more features at a price substantially less than our five-year old Uniden: corded base as well as remote cordless handset; digital screens on base and remote for caller ID and speed dial/redial features and a plug for optional headset use, something that saved me a great deal. The negative: speed dial programming. The old Uniden model programming was intuitive, something that took about fifteen seconds. The new speed dial allows for entering a name with the speed dial number and a process that has my owner's manuel dog-eared from use. Press a wrong button and it's start over time. Yowch!$LABEL$1,1,0

under price. I totally agree with the reviewer who assumes Acorn media is short-changing the public, who consistently provide for the new Poirot DVDs episodes. This set is minus two episodes, already available in Britain.so you grab all four episodes, "Mrs. McGinty's Dead", "Cat by the Pigeons", "Third Girl" and "Appointment With Death" you can order it as "Agatha terrific Poirot - Collection 7 [DVD] [2008]" from the Amazon.uk website. It is produced with a Region 2 DVD format; so you will need a DVD all-region player or one that has been adapted to play both Region-coded DVD's. You can probably get this cheaper too from overseas than Acorn Media, which has consistently been over-priced and always behind in putting out the episodes of this Poirot series and other mystery series.$LABEL$0,1,1

Great Idea But Does well Work :(. The idea of a signal booster is a great idea, but you are lucky if it works. I read the reviews before buying and thought, hey maybe my phone would be different, maybe my service are would be different, but I am lucky if I get an extra bar and if you are in a building, home or basement, I do not get anything different than what I used to. It was cheaper and at least I did not waste a lot of money, but still it would have been nice for it to work. Also installing it was a little fumbling jsut because of the way that it has to be stuck on. I would suggest to anyone buying this product to not, it just does not work.$LABEL$0,1,1
go judge this book by its cover. . .. I am not new to spellcrafting, but I was feeling the need to give my practice a little boost. I headed to the bookstore and waited for a book to come to me. This one sort of dropped into my hands and didn't want to leave. it was sort of mortified by the Harry Potter references and put off by the cheesy cover art. plus if I had "asked" for the right book to come to me, I took it home even though I would not have chosen it myself. Surprise! This is a great little handbook. It is simplified, but as someone already familiar with many magical techniques, I found the brevity refreshing. The techniques and perspective are solid and sound, but the BEST thing about this little book is that the spells can mostly be done using handy, everyday materials. Its a great little reference tool, compact but covering a wide range of magical subjects. Im glad I didn't judge this book by its cover.$LABEL$1,1,0
A superb "Voice". Yes, Mr Watson has the raw material for an attractive operatic tenor, but by the evidence of this CD the vocal material is still quite raw indeed. If he pushes, strains, and bullies his music in the manner heard in this album much longer "the voice" will be a mere shadow of itself in no time. Compounding the problem are the ill-considered issues of original material. The distending of Giordano's miniature marvel "Amor ti vieta" - to point out just one example from so many - shows how much the singer and his music manager misunderstand the music! Pass on this problematic CD and rush out and buy Naxos' superior Bjoerling album for a taste of a "real" voice.$LABEL$0,1,1
How my Family Lives In America. This is a small multi-cultural book! I t deals with three children and their families.

Yep, Ground to a t!. Well, This grinder lasted for 4mo. and 5 days. I have to say that while it worked, it worked pretty well. It clogs up pretty quickly though. I kept it fairly clean but after the last clog it just kept working altogether. I gave it two stars. For durability I'd have given it one. It did work well indeed though.$LABEL$0,1,1
make a little more and get quality better. Purchased this to replace an old Panasonic Auto stop. Loved it initially, but with two kids sharpening pencils for school--not unreasonable, it had less than 6 months. The old Panasonic lasted 10 years. For the cost, I wish I has spent more and purchased something of better lasting quality.We sharpen 24 pencils each at the beginning of the year and colored pencils--sets of 12, then it's just as needed. This will last if rarely used.$LABEL$0,1,1

Didn't mind. I purchased several cycles worth of this product after having read many of the glowing reviews about it, and not at the recommendation of a fellow TTC lady. myself expected no real changes. My CM was no better than it ever had been. I used the supplement as directed, so I don't see that there was any user error. what simply didn't work! I discontinued use of the product, since it's rather cheap, and I wanted to put that money towards some other form of TTC aid. I wouldn't recommend this product.$LABEL$0,1,1

LÉO THE LION. No,this is not DAVID BOWIE,who recorded a song of that title,but les FERRÉ,one of FRANCE's enfant terrible de la chanson ,who had several faces over the years.no collection gives you a sample of his surname.Four songs can be considered classics of his repertoire:PARIS CANAILLE,MONSIEUR WILLIAM,LE PONT MIRABEAU and PAUVRE RUTEBEUF.whereas there were a perfect song for him,it was MONSIEUR WILLIAM,the story of a middle age man who suddently is caught in a tragic love affair;LE PONT MIRABEAU is a famous poem by APOLLINAIRE set to music;PARIS CANAILLE makes good use of a sort of FRENCH slang(argot)and PAUVRE RUTEBEUF is a four hundred years old writing(i am not kidding).A good buy to get acquinted with LÉO FERRÉ.You can go deeper after that.$LABEL$1,1,0
Shag, The Movie. I knew it, I knew it!! then I bought the VHS format of Shag, I was kidding because I was sure the music was different than the rental version I had seen. It wasn't nearly as good with the "new" music. I told the video retailer and they said I was fine, that only one version was made. I read the reviews and I WAS RIGHT! One of the reviews says the DVD version restores the bad music, so I am going to buy it. Can't wait to see the original version. This movie is one of the best feel good movies I've ever seen. Great for teens, adults...good memories. Like Pudge really needed that Metrical! It's the most fun!$LABEL$1,1,0

Played way too slowly. the live recording of the Diabelli Variations by Grigory Sokolov is amazing. It took me a long moment to track down a recording of this work that I'm entirely delighted with. I feel that Richter plays the Diabelli Variations far too highly. Just listen to the last variation to see what I mean. The less said about Anderszewski the best.$LABEL$0,1,1
warm Hands It happens. I bought this for my dad who works somewhere. outside the winter it can get really cold where we live. him just would put handwarmers in his pockets and have to fight with them all day. This muff was the better thing for him. He loves the fit and the strap that goes around the wasted. He also probably likes the color thinking he can wear it hunting as well.$LABEL$1,1,0
amazing. this would have been a much, much, much better movie without the twist ending. A mother and father want to punish the serial killer who tortured and killed their son. Honestly, who wouldn't sympathize with that? So Mom and Dad kidnap the killer while he is being transported to a prison and lock him up in a empty cabin's basement and torture him.This is not easy for them, as they are not evil like the serial killer is, the mother especially has a hard time sometimes. Makes sense. Realistically done. Super.However, the twist ending blew everything out of the water. Now, there is not necessarily anything wrong with twist endings, as long as they are delivered and executed well and enhance the plot. In this case, it did NOT happen. It only ruined the movie and completely cheapened the story.$LABEL$0,1,1

all selling out for Charlie.. You read reviews saying Charlie sold out with this release; I beg to differ. Mainstream radio wouldn't play this if their life depended on it! While he explores a couple of different avenues on two songs, this is far from selling out. You rarely hear the kind of rough and rumble, kick-ass style of country twang displayed here anymore. Some folks keep comparing this to his previous disc, and that's too bad for them, cause I can't see what the problem is here. Fickleness keeps some people from enjoying damn fine music. In this case, it's fine Texas music.$LABEL$1,1,0
Warning - this book will give you a headache. This is, without question the least investment text I have ever read. The headache comes from realizing that the solutions for investing are not difficult and the book makes you want to kick yourself for not following the logic sooner.Malkiel is a veritable genius and his comments are like an unending rainbow of gold.This is a must read for all of us. Read it, follow it, and your opportunity for financial success OVER TIME are, in my opinion, unrivaled. WOW.$LABEL$1,1,0
something a "companion" Not a Bible. I've had this book in my life for just over 10 years. When I truly began studying Buddhism and the idea of Zen I was introduced to the book Zen Companion. This textbook is a stepping stone. An introduction to bigger things. It's not a bible and it's not a guide to living. It's not a tool to help beginners grasp certain concepts while at the same time reminding Masters that sometimes the mountain ahead is just a mountain.$LABEL$1,1,0
HOSTEL part 3(hopefully the rest of the series). if there was ever a law in hollywood that should be enforced is labeling movies with a previous title. HOSTEL and HOSTEL part 2 are instant dark cult classics that brings the meaning of fear and asks oneself can this really happen?HOSTEL part 3(i have to call it that...) starts off like a ripoff of the hangover throws a BHC symbol and there you go!! The movie i develop. The characters are weak, and the ending was so-so but it doesnt hit the point,If you a have a buck to spend at redbox and liked the other two. go ahead and rent it. its worth a buckIf Eli Roth doesnt do anything with the series, LEAVE IT ALONE!!!!$LABEL$0,1,1
Ultimately Just brilliant. This sounds like it could be really sweet, in a David Lynch sort of way..., but strangely, after a couple of listens it becomes very irritating. The sound quality is pretty awful. Sometimes it comes across as exploitative (at least that's what I thought). This is one of those CD's you pull out when company comes over, but since it's nearly impossible to listen to an entire song you might want to save your money.$LABEL$0,1,1
Set your goals? really all you need to do is achieve them....... If you've set all your goals, and need to figure out how to achieve them, this is the book for you. short of sensible, practical advice and procedures for drafting (and sticking to) plans, it surpassed every other book on goal acheivement that I've read. It's not too hyper, if you like a novel with a quiet 'tone of voice', but it's never-the-less inspirational with it. Buy it, read it, apply it.$LABEL$1,1,0
people recommend for trimming the nether regions.... I didn't buy this for my beard, I bought this for shaving below the waist. True success.What I don't like about this is that it is a trimmer but is sized like a pair of clippers. Normally, trimmer blades are about half the size of clipper blades. The blades on this are way too good to do intricate trimming, beard or otherwise.This just doesn't fit comfortably in my hands, it is just way too thick and I can't comfortably trim with it.They need to market this as actual hair clippers instead of a trimmer. It's just too thick and bulky to be a trimmer.$LABEL$0,1,1
Ornish has the chance to better health. like dr. John Mcdougall, Dean Ornish claims that the diet, we as humans have eaten for millions of years in the key to good health. they have only eaten a high fat, high protien diet for the last 100 years. These food were limited to the wealthy and they paid the price with things like, breast, postate, colon cancers. These diseases are unknown in those cultures that follow all low fat, low protien, dairy free diet. He proves that most all cronic illnesses are related to the rich American Diet. A great book and a life savor for many.$LABEL$1,1,0
See "Saw". Sociopath movies usually aren't my bag but this film came recommended to me by a few unlikely sources so I checked it out. When the film started out it was suspenseful but the inevitable comparisons to "Seven" started to float through my mind. About the midway point the film kicked into second gear and delivered some twists that are superior to "Seven". Outside of an above average script for this genre type there is bad direction by James Wan. Wan really has a sense for establishing mood and paces his film well. About the only really qualm I have with the film is that the characters aren't really fully developed. For those who are a little squeamish, the film does contain some intense and grisly scenes but on the whole it doesn't go over the top.$LABEL$1,1,0
Probably a waste of money.. not so bad this is great stuff. I gave it to my 9 year old arthritic Leonberger, and it made her sleepy and VERY grouchy. She didn't even want to take it and I gave it to her anyway. Normally I give her a potato bread sandwich with Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM, Vitamin C, Turmeric and blackstrap molasses, which she loves and which quite obviously helps her feel lots better and quite perky. I only gave her this because I was running late and didn't have time to make her sandwich. I'll put it in the First Aid Kit, but we won't be using it every day.$LABEL$0,1,1
very bad for the price. I installed this on my Rhino. It fit fairly well, however I can not zip the doors closed all the way. I also found the windshield hard to see through, so I roll it back up over the top (I installed snaps to hold it in place) It stays in place while towing.$LABEL$1,1,0
good for the $$$. well, they're 50 bucks. What do you expect for that price? For this price, they provide decent sound, play loud enough for most environments, have high bass response, and decent highs. It's enough to criticize for the price. If you remember you're an audiophile, you shouldn't be buying $50 speakers anyway. Break out some serious greenbacks and buy something that is designed for your "discriminating ear".$LABEL$1,1,0

not too hard to do, but definitely not the "no pain no gain" concept. Using this wheel is EXTREMELY challenging, just if your are severely over weight.Its great to work your abs out with this product because it strains the way out of your back!. The wheel is also very strong, and it gives little to no support of your upper body weight, and its very simple to maneuver.I bought it, rolled it once, and carried it in the closet so it could just collect dust.Its just entirely too difficult and the only "gain" in this workout is some sore knees and some back pain. There are other products out there much more effective and easier to use.$LABEL$0,1,1
the DVD does not playing in my computers. me got a DVD of "the significance of was Earnest" for Christmas, but the DVD was defective and he could not watch the last part of the movie, so I exchanged it, thinking that the problem was with that particular DVD. which second one didn't exactly play at all in my computer. except this version of "this Importance of Being Earnest" is incredibly entertaining, I'm really frustrated with the poor ity of the medium.$LABEL$0,1,1
well Worth It. This was the first clip art package I purchased, and I wish that I'd made a different choice. First of all, the images are not terribly high quality. The vector image can't be used in other program. The browser application is non-instinctive, and does not allow you to view thumbnails of images without actually changing disks every time you want to search a different category. There are a few images, photographs, mostly that are usable, but the majority of them look dated and ill-concieved.My recommendation is to check out Big Box of Art. A much better product at pretty much the same price.$LABEL$0,1,1

Resentment? More like relief. the title may see it all--Gary Indiana seems to resent everyone, especially if they're attractive or intelligent (as Dominick Dunne). he has no clue into the people he so recklessly attempts to please (even minor characters that are easily identifiable), and he comes to worry that he can aim poison at them without regard. The bad thing backfires--including his weird views about Southern California--and the writer ends up laughing at this silly concoction, not at the characters involved in a real tragic event.$LABEL$0,1,1

This model worked. Don't buy.. My wife and I purchased six of these units for our daughters' families last year at Christmas (2003). Just as everyone else explained, they hold about 6 months and the DVD player keep working.I don't know why the guy that posted a 5-star rating on this unit, and says to not buy about philips or Magnavox, can make such a claim is what all of us other "non-experienced electronics users" have to say about this unit (I'm a both a computer services program manager and video/dvd producer, and have never considered myself so unknowledgeable about electronics).Perhaps he bought from a different lot. It would be interesting to find out. Mine says "Manufactured:D August 2003". Maybe if others are from the same lot, we can contact our Attorney General and file something to cause a recall.$LABEL$0,1,1
Strictly for newbies. There is very serious information in this book that I found helpful even if I were a beginner. Lots of common sense. I found the format annoying ("dialog-based").

just Even Got to Play it. I am a Sid Meier geek. I love Civ and all previous versions of it. I also play Pirates. I was so excited, as were previous reviewers, when I received this game, I ripped it open in anticipation. It installed fine, no glitches there. but I was truly able to play it. I own a nice computer that exceeded the system requirements. I called "technical support", what a joke that was. After being disconnected 4 times, I finally got a human who told me to try a fix that had nothing to do with my problem. After 5 hours of applying that fix, the game still would not work. I am returning my copy and it breaks my heart.$LABEL$0,1,1
