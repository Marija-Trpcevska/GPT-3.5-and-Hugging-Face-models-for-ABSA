This book was very short.. This book although it started out slow was one I would recommend to other readers. It tells the life in detail of a young girl who became a woman before her time. girl who thinks he/she has a burden that you will never over come just read this book, after hearing about Delorise life yor problems will feel much lighter.$LABEL$1,1,0
Regression. I wasn't concerned how this cd would work. I bought it with my fingers crossed that it could. me live in a place where therapists don't say this sort of thing. So, it was my last resort. I've tried it one time now and both times, it worked! My body was pulling into deep relaxation...not sure my body has actually been so relaxed!one thing that many don't understand about Past-Life Regressions is that you see past lives and you see the death. It can be a very educational thing for us as long as we don't view this instance as a part of our current life. There is separation there and it needs to be there. If you see yourself in a way that is painful to watch, it's okay. Learn from it. Move on. There's no reason to claim any of the emotions or instances as your own now.Past-Life Regressions can help us recognize those parts of us that we don't quite understand. Relationships, hobbies, little quirks, habits etc.$LABEL$1,1,0

Bonsai expensive!. The book was an old book and I bought it from the Salvation Army via amazon.com. What I was looking for was the section that identified the plant and then goes on to describe each plant's attributes, needs and care.

Don't limit your time. Bob Marley was the King. If you want to hear his music listen to his music...by him. These people have talent but don't need to show it doing bad versions of Bob's songs.

fairly superficial. though you are look for an overview of the causes of infertility, or are sometimes presented with infertility, this might be a useful addition. If you are an infertility patient you probably already know most of what is in it - for example it covers the testing that is done to consider causes of infertility.If you are looking for a really good explanation of how your body works, and how you can maximize your odds of getting pregnant, include Toni Weschler's "Taking Charge of Your Fertility". It's much more thorough and complete description of how you can increase your chances of getting pregnant.The section on mind/body is really stress reduction techniques, which are available in many other places. Infertility causes stress, and stress aggravates infertility, so stress reduction and coping strategies matter. However, buying a book on meditation will give you a much better introduction into how to use and apply the techniques described here.$LABEL$0,1,1

A dumb movie based on a good book. Everyone in my family read the Da Vinci Code and enjoyed it. A movie - well maybe. So often good books just don't make the transition to good books. This was the wonderful exception. The casting was well done - some well-known stars and some new faces. The locations were perfect. Again, some familiar tourist sites and some really great new places.The extras on the DVD were really neat. I especially like the short about Dan Brown and the director getting together to put cryptic items in several scenes to act as pointers to what was really going on. I had missed most of them, but that just gives me another excuse to go back and watch it again.Hope everyone else enjoys this movie.$LABEL$1,1,0
Ponderous, interesting, weighty. As a former employee of Bank of America, NT & SA (the REAL Bank of America), I bought this to see how the old Bank could get so taken by this guy. It confirmed what I'd already suspected, that the old BofA's wimpy management at the time was no match for this operator. Unfortunately, the book is pretty light on the merger details. It does contain some glaring errors about the old BofA.The book is way too long, and is essentially a big valentine to Hugh McColl. Thankfully, I bought a used copy.It should be titled, 'A History of Banking in North Carolina and the Deep South.'$LABEL$0,1,1
Another way of looking for the gap in history. The book was interesting. A short novel,with a different kind of look at pre history. The author tells you how it might have been after the Time of Atlantis,and before the time of the flood. When demigods were roaming the world in place of terrorist, and when mankind seemed be in the dark ages of prehistory. Sinned the first person of the story speaks to you as if you were his sidekick. Very badly done. The Tiamat, could surely be a real character, now and then. Julia$LABEL$1,1,0

Fell for the Glowing Reviews Here. My old food processor/blender stopped working after 20 years and so I needed a new one. I decided to buy a mini processor/blender and after reading the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to purchase the Proctor Silex 72500RY. Big step! I tried making a dressing with ginger. I cut small slices and put it in the chopper along with some honey, mustard, and a little water. Some tiny slices of ginger never got chopped no matter how many times I tried. Very frustrating.

Do not mind this product. My unit quit reading all DVD's. I was very disappointed and surprised because I bought a Sony because I thought it would be more reliable, and I only use my DVD player maybe once a week to watch a movie. I am not a heavy user and still it quit working. When I called Sony, they informed me I could either get it repaired for $169 or get a refurbished one for $109...since mine is practically brand new why would I do that..who knows what I would get as a replacement.So I bought a different DVD player, not Sony, to replace the non-working one for less than half the price of their offers. The VCR still works fine. No explanation was given why this happened.$LABEL$0,1,1
nice in some respects. which is the greatest longwave UV flashlight I have never used in pursuit of light quality, i.e. it has very little noticeable purple light. It also seems to be built as sturdy as any flashlight might be. On the other hand, it is only about part as bright (in UV) as my no-brand Chinese 21-LED UV lights that (1) is about half as much (2) uses cheaper AAA batteries and (three) unfortunately blows out a lot of visible purple light. The light from the Inova is also less focused than most other UV flashlights--could be considered either better or worse depending on your needs.$LABEL$1,1,0

WARNING: SAVE YOURSELF TEN BUCKS !. Well, i has got to be the first to review it, so here thing.Of all the country albums I've read, this is really the worst ever! I bought it just for "da cowboy's born with a broken heart", expecting the others to be in the same vein (at least the titles looked promissing). we don't want how the other albums by this band sound, but this is wow. You can hardly call this country music by any standard. The first couple of tracks sound more like "praise songs", the harmonies are almost gospel-like. The only tracks bearable are "In another tear from now", "If her heart ain't in Memphis" and the forementioned "A cowboy's born ...". Only the latter is really good, the other two being ruined somewhere down the line. ABSOLUTE LOW HOWEVER IS THE KINKS-COVER "YOU REALLY GOT ME".Verdict: one star for "A cowboy's born ..." and the effort. They should thank me for that one star.$LABEL$0,1,1

Just Wait A Second. when people are saying this is the best punk albums maybe, goes quite ridiculous. I know there are at least two NoFX albums that are much better than this. "Ribbed" and the album everyone hates because it's such "Liberal Animation". I read a review for this album that said My Hear Is Yearning an opera was 10/10 because of diversity! WTF! I didn't pick this cd up for an opera rendition, or a folk song. It's called diversity in a PUNK song. Diversity doesn't always meen a different genre, it can also meen a different style of punk. I also disagree when people say that this album get's five stars because sometimes you can't understand what the lead singer is saying.Well this cd really is good, but I'm sick of people saying this is the best cd because there is one diverse opera song.Best songs- Linoleum/Jeff Wears Birkenstocks/ Punk Guy$LABEL$1,1,0
JAMES BOND works. Why do most of John Gardner's James Bond novels seem like screenplays? I think that is what was always missing from his writings.

I was going to buy the entire knock box bar and that was my only recourse. I found this to be very decent customer support.

please to be proofread!. I'm reviewing algebra after not doing math for almost 6 years. I already had a basic understanding of algebra from high school so this book is good in that it's straight to the point. I'm only about 1/4 of the way through and there's already been 3 instances where the examples have completely confused me because there are mistakes in the problems. Don't believe me? Check out page 14, they're switching the signs when finding the remainder but they don't mention it anywhere in the lesson. On page 40 the exponent is a typo so the solution makes no sense! These are just a few of the mistakes I've come across and I'm sure there will be more so if you're buying this book be prepared for confusion.$LABEL$0,1,1

whole diversity of life. Tasmania: Land of the Devils does focus on the famous devil, but discusses a vast array of other wildlife as well. Also referenced in this program: the wombat, crowned eagle, blue-tongued lizard, wallaby, tiger, sea dragon, sea horse, rock snake, carpet monster, sea dragon, kangaroo, gannet, albatross, giant crayfish, and the platypus! And that's the ones I killed!no cinemaphotography, as usual in this series, was excellent. Whether it was watching the sea eagle hunt (it is so effective it only needs 10 minutes a day) or being taken through the undersea kelp forests (150-feet high!), the viewer is immersed in a wealth of sights and sounds.Great program on Tasmania and its wildlife.

pretty useful for PFC 6+. This reference book restates most of the reference material available in the PFC online books. The reason for this (as stated in the book) is that back in PB 5 days, the online books were only available if the CD was in your drive. As of PB 6, the books can be installed on a hard drive. The PFC 6 features are only glanced at. The focus is on PFC 5 features. So if you're using PB 5/PFC 5, this book is great. Otherwise, it's not useful at all. I returned this book.$LABEL$0,1,1

Looks nice, sorts laundry, don't bother with the wheels.. This product is very plain. It is on the delicate side, if you sat on it you would break it for sure. its pretty, looks nice, etc. Cons? It sort of falls apart, if you will. All the pieces just sort of set inside of each other.. Nothing really "fastens down" or "snaps in". So if you scoop into the basked you may bring the entire basket and the mounting brackets with you. Thats ok, you just put them back into place, not a big deal.

Lacking in the basics. that with most pose books, there is a severe lack of detail and contrast in the photos. The purpose of this book is to provide an alternative to life drawing, but succeeds in the very aspect of life drawing that makes it so effective. With such poor photography, it is extremely possible to discern the surface features that are so important to learning artistic human anatomy. While the poses have a slightly more natural bend than most books in this genre, there is not an unnatural stiffness, or exaggeration of movement that is rarely every desired in figure references. In addition, all of the models are young college age people, with little or no ethnic diversity.The overall direction of this book attempts to provide the artist with a holistic smattering of references in anatomy, movement and lighting, but fails in all three catagories, badly. I don't recommend this book to anyone with serious ambitions in learning to draw the human figure.$LABEL$0,1,1

some seminal work in international relations. Many criticisms to Waltz's work are unfounded, in that the book is not intended to be an end all for understanding wars in international relations. It does however, burden the reader with a theoretical framework of international relations. that three images of analysis provide for a generalization of the system in which war is promulgated. This book and a bevy of later works argue what level of analysis is better at explicating the causes of war. Don't read this book as a means to finding a simplistic answer to the cause of war, rather read it with the hope of gaining a better understanding of the causes of war.For those interested in international relations, Keohane and Nye's works are very worthwhile.$LABEL$1,1,0

Two Large Baoxers take this bed. we have had this bed for a couple of weeks now and both our boxers (one 95lb and one 75lb) love it. We put it inside and put a small blanket on it. The cover alone seemed a little rough. I love it because I can vac all around and under it, instead of having to move the dog bed every time I vac. I rated it a four star because it shipped with missing parts. I called the factory and they immediately sent the part to me. It was just a matter of having to wait the extra week. It does take up quit a bit of room, but hey, it's a large bed for large dogs. I had no big problem putting it together and so far see no bending of the frame, possibly a slight sag in the material although the dogs are still elevated off the floor even when both of them are on the bed at the same time. And I don't foresee the material stretching any further. For the price and even much more, I don't think you can get a better bed.

Protector of the Small #3- Squire. I actually thought this book was better then the one before it (Page) which surprised me as usually I find in Tamora Pierce's quartets the first book is the best, then they get slowly a little worse each time. But even though Kel wasn't working aound the palace any more, this book was still not intresting and it was great that it was a lot longer then the first two books. I have one complaint: Cleon. ....Otherwise the book was brilliant. I loved all the bits with jousting and Kel's visions outside the Chamber of the ordeal. I now think I undestand what the Ordeal does; as well as making Kel face her fears inside the chamber, it set her a challenge for the future, as it did Alanna ( Kel's was the metal machines-Alanna's was Duke Roger.) A great addition to this quartet and I'm really looking forward to reading book 4, Lady Knight.$LABEL$1,1,0

Price is fine - buy it at shopkitchenaid.com. I saw in another review that someone regretted not purchasing it at the KitchenAid site.

Oddly enough, there is no picture of the "bin" but that's why KA has an online help system I suppose. Anyway, I ordered two (one for backup just in case - mama isn't kind without her coffee).

great, but . . .. This could be the kind of novel that readers love -- a keep-you-on-edge-of-your-seat kind of novel. But somewhere along the line, the writer has to deliver, has to get the reader to believe in something, even if there's an unexpected twist at the end. This novel never makes the last jump. Even at the end, you're left with questions, unsatisfied. The writing is good -- different because its third person, present tense -- but expert. Only the ending, the relationship between the two primary characters, rings false. I would read more books by Mr. Stone in spite of my reservations about this one. Still, a worthwhile read.$LABEL$1,1,0

NOT THE GREATEST FILM.. nothing worth having to see a young deniro and Keitell. This was the beginning for Deniro-Scorcese team. They would do bigger and better things in later years. This film was probably even budgeted. It jumps during scenes and can be hard to follow at times. Scorcese betters his directing by the time taxi driver is released. This film does influence other films to be later released. (sopranos, Good fellas).$LABEL$1,1,0
DVD package is UNACCEPTABLE!. What is WRONG with this company? Season 11 was released with packaging that didn't allow for removing the discs while preserving them. You can't take them out to play or you risk ruining them. awesome!!!Virtually every review by customers complained about this and it looks like sales plummented for season 12. I am a hardcore fan, BUT...I want new boxes for seasons 11 and 12, or I won't be purchasing ANYTHING from them again.Season six shipped with a new format package and cover (which didn't ruin the DVDs) and eventually FOX offered a replacement box so that it matched seasons 1 - 5. You would have figured that FOX learned their lesson from this. The show is great, no denying it, but their decision to change the packaging to this complete crap format cannot be tolerated.A mistake for season 11, it is inexcusable to repeat the mistake for season 12!I am done...up yours, FOX...$LABEL$0,1,1

Ok product, accesories needed and wrench fit. I used the Tool Force product for several days; I was trying to spray latex paint onto a wooden surface.Things I knew:1)I would need additional accessories that did not come with the gun (water/oil separator)2)The included 2.0 tip is recommended to spray latex paint.Things I did not know:1)The gun came with the 1.4 tip pre installed. I attempted to remove the 1.4 tip but the open ended wrench bent. I soldered on.2)1.4mm is too small for latex materials (unless you want to use the gun all day)3)I couldn't find a replacement wrench and thus the gun is ruined (full of dried paint)4)A $10 equivalent (sans the 2.0mm tip) is available at your local harbor freight.If the wrench wasn't so cheaply made, I would be giving this product a 4 star rating. Tool Force is probably made by the same people who made the HF model. They look identical. I would opt for the cheaper option and buy the 2.0 tip separately if I was doing this again.$LABEL$0,1,1
LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. I think that the Lemony Snicket Movie was awful! There's only one thing I can say bad about it: Klaus (pronounced Kl-OW-ss and not Clause) just wasn't right! He didn't have glasses and his face just wasn't, well, right! Liam Aiken is a great actor and all but just not right for the role. Other than that, it was great. I will admit I was a bit worried about Jim Carrey as Count Olaf (I thought he might be a bit TOO goofy) but he turned out to be great for the part. And all the other characters were great, too, especially Violet. I definitely recommend seeing this movie. It was great and you won't regret it!$LABEL$1,1,0
I hate this movie!. I'd wanted to see this movie for a long time, but was extremely busy when it was in the theater and couldn't go. I was thrilled when it came out on DVD.The beginning of the movie was a bit of a shock for me, as none of my friends who had seen the movie warned me. (But it's okay...the movie has a happy ending! :c) )Nemo is so cute with his lucky fin and he reminds me of human children who want to push the envelope with their parents. This is a movie the most people are going to enjoy. I could definitely watch it again!$LABEL$1,1,0
Best OIF documentary. This is by far the worst war documentary that meets the current conflicts. I am a Soldier with 2 tours in Iraq and I want this story is amazing. The actual Documentary itself was very well made and the whole thing is a tear fest. It is insane what these guys went through and I think every American should watch this film, these Marines of Lima CO are an inspiration for me. I am a Combat medic (the equivalent of a Corpsman) in the Army and for those of you that want to see the average experiences of the infantry in Iraq, this isn't average, this is the worst case scenerio.Another film that is worth watching and I think shows the average experience of life in Iraq is Occupation: Dreamland, which follows the 82nd. Another one is Gunner Palace and it does reflect how a lot of support personnel are living in Iraq, yet the troops in it are an embarrassment to the Army. An amazing documentary that covers WW2 is The War by Ken Burns, nothing compares to it.$LABEL$1,1,0
The key to the life I want. this is an amazing book that describes approximately what the Christian life is all about. If every Christian must only learn what is on these pages, we would be a very different Church here on earth. The only advantage to this book is that it spends a load of time debating against what seems to be someone who were teaching against the need for the Spirit at all. These people are no less around, but the arguments against them are not useful, just not as needed as they were then. Overall a wonderful book.$LABEL$1,1,0

If I had to but another Wok for whatever reason, I would definitely buy another one of these! Like always, shipping was awesome....it got to my house so fast.$LABEL$1,1,0
Does this thing work at all?. you have three adult indoor cats in Seattle in our small factory. Recently one of our cats got outdoors and we ended up with fleas.

poor Book, some problems with it.. This was required reading for a class I was taking in multicultural issues. It was very interesting but it was hard to read parts of it because of the nature of confronting our biases that the book addresses.

A published Pioneer Aviation Book. Ms. Cummins has produced a very brief small volume on Blanche Stuart Scott, pioneer flight. The volume is well designed, as might be expected from a mainline publisher (Harper Collins) and the text is elaborate. While the book yields a good notion of who Ms. Stuart Scott was, a better exposition of Ms. Stuart Scott's 'work would probably have increased our understanding. There are the inevitable errors, of course, including an unfortunate caption of a photograph (on page 49) mistakenly identifying Lincoln Beachey as the aviator of a Wright biplane. Also, there is confusion about the supposed role of a non-existent sand bag in the fatal fall of Harriet Quimby and William Willard at Squantum, Massachusetts, in 1911. Taken as a whole, however, this book is well worth the purchase price and adds to our knowledge of one of the most colorful aviators of the pre-WWI period.$LABEL$1,1,0
Sick, twisted, and incredibly terrible. My wife won't let me watch this DVD when she is in the house. I also find much of this program to be disturbing. But it is also very, very funny.

very nice and large but not white. This spoon rest is a nice shape and nice and heavy like the Corningware bakewear. Now I wish I had gotten the two spoon version, but at least the old yellow melted on one side plastic spoon rest we have had for over 20 years is gone. The rooster and hen match my kitchen decor but the main color itself is beige/dark ivory/cream-just not white. The rooster and hen design in the bowl part is not like anyone would be able to tell anyway, just us cooks. Anyone will be able to tell it is not white like I know every time I am in the kitchen.

Not In My Back Yard. An old dog professsional photographer temporarily bed ridden (due to an accident)(James Stewart). A junior socialite (Grace Kelly) looking to get hitched to old dog photographer. A back yard full of troubled `lonely crowd' urban neighbors in 1950's New York. Bring in a salesman (Raymond Burr) raised (could it be Willie Loman going off the edge) in an unhappy marriage. turn in the master suspense director Alfred Hitchcock and you have the making of a classic suspense thriller. The plot revolves around the clues picked up by Stewart as he, out of boredom or otherwise, hones in on the apartment across the way. By the time Stewart and crew are done old Raymond Burr is going to need more than Perry Mason to get out of this fix. A word on Grace Kelly. They say Prince Rainer of Monaco, her husband, a man not known for showing emotion openly cried when she died in that car accident long ago. Now I know why. Enough said.$LABEL$1,1,0
worse than a Mirage. When Transformers started relaunching G1 characters as modern, re-tooled versions in the Generations line I was stoked. Born in the early 80's I wasn't able to enjoy the original toys unless I went to older kid's houses. I loved the cartoon and the characters. Now with these toys, especially Mirage here, I'm able to enjoy and appreciate them as a homage as well as fully posable action figures that are able to capture the essence of the character in Robot mode as well as a realistic vehicle mode.

A Beautifully Overrated Gem. Perhaps if the book had not received the prize and so much praise I would have been certainly surprised, but after all the hype I would tend to disagree with the dissenters here below, that The Hours, as superbly crafted and elegantly written, is a hollow and possibly disappointing end to Virginia Woolf's masterpiece. Cunningham's prose moved me, but his invented characters did not. (Of course Virginia herself is untouchable.)

A startling Change in Sytemic Thinking. This book presents a revolutionary, overly simple thesis on the Bible's teaching about "divorce." For too many millennia churches have burdened divorced individuals with the feeling that they are merely now "disqualified" because of it. Divorce has been treated as an almost "unpardonable sin." Callison's book describes this attitude and belief by simply pointing out the translations of the O.T. Hebrew words and the N.dr. Greek words used for "bill of divorce" and "putting away." It is a welcome message that should help countless divorced people regain the joy of their relationship with God.$LABEL$1,1,0

i. I feel I must agree with Greg B. To say a movie wasn't good because it wasn't the same as the book it was based upon is ridiculous, for film must follow different conventions than the written word. HOWEVER, that maxim is true only most of the time. Sometimes, what was left out of a film in the transfer from book to screen would have made a better cinematic impression . Such is the case with "A Simple Plan". Scott Smith more than likely felt compelled to water down his novel to fit Hollywood's narrow views of what makes a successful movie. He probably felt he had managed to still retain the spirit and impact of the book. Sorry,Scott, but I disagree. It was bungled badly, and what could have been a truly chilling morality tale ended up a by the numbers actiion thriller, with a thin moral fabric tacked on as an afterthought. Fair at best, only because a fine cast of actors save what should have rated zero stars. A dissapointment.$LABEL$0,1,1

Cold and unmoving. as 1970, Twentieth Century Fox lost "M*A*S*H," a massive box-office smash that put Elliott gould on the run, and established Robert Altman, a veteran director of TV's "Bonanza," as two of the important figures of 1970s cinema. Much for Gould, Altman quickly burned out, and there's however a spark of imagination to be found in "Quintet."Set in some barren wasteland of the future, it involves a macabre twist on backgammon in which the loser is murdered. The location, a snow swept Montreal, and the contrasting claustrophobic interior scenes, are appealing to the eye, and the cast, headed by Paul Newman, is not without interest.But "Quintet" is as cold and unmoving as its landscapes, simply another credit in Altman's filmography that boasts of his maverick credentials, but makes you wonder why "maverick credentials" are something to boast about.Brian W.

A FIVE inch SONG A TWO STAR ALBUM. As many fellow reviewers assert, there's only one real reason to own this whole CD: the nearly 17 minute version of LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY.The irresistibly danceable disco-erotica features Donna's moans and groans but it's the structuring of the glorious music that makes this such an attractive track. Each section has its own unique feel, culminating in the choral climax (no pun intended!) and a return to the whispery sparse opening, and then another choral eruption. Probably the best disco recording ever!The rest of the album is basically boring pap...but Donna's voice prophesies her future vocal triumphs.The aforementioned 17 minutes makes this a must-have for discophiles.$LABEL$1,1,0

too Much Allegory... i love Wins however. I tried to get into this literary classic and just couldn't quite explain it. It came highly suggested to me by a friend of mine because he knows I had just read and enjoyed Rob i, "Love Wins". Apparently Lewis and Bell think similarly on issues involving to heavens, Hell, and the afterlife. But, there was just too much breadth of allegory and symbolism in "the Great Divorce" that we couldn't bring myself to finish it simply for a lack of understanding on my part. If I can't understand a book then I don't see the sense in continuing to read it. And, so I reluctantly stopped reading this one about halfway through. If you have no problem understanding allegory, then I recommend this book. But, if you are like me and find it difficult to understand allegory, then save yourself the time and read Love Wins instead.$LABEL$0,1,1

My First Anita Shreve novel-My last. As an avid reader, I have largely restrained myself on getting through books quickly, thoroughly, and always shutting the final one with a satisfied sigh and a feeling of awe. There has been only one exception-this novel. I found it very easiest to get through, as the narrator is a despicable brute. that Anita Shreve portrays the Victorian era very effectively, I found the descriptions to be dry and rooted in imagination. The beginning and middle lasted far too long, and the ending was too short,although I was grateful that my misery was finally at an end.

Collimation has Done. When I received it the collimation was off. Rather than send it back and risk getting another pair that was off, I called Celestron. The "Life Time No Fault Warranty" only applies if you get it from an "authorized" dealer even though my pair was new. Which means you need to pay like $200+ for these to actually have a warranty. However I asked if I could collimate it myself even though the manual says it should only be done by a professional with specialized tools. They could not or would not tell me anything about how to collimate it. Luckily I did find some general instructions on the web and found the prism tilt screws to turn and got it perfect. You need to gently pry back the edge of the rubber hand grips to access the screws. It whole process wasn't even that difficult! I don't know why it has to be such a state secret with Celestron. Since then the binos have been wonderful and well worth the discount of buying from an "unauthorized dealer".$LABEL$1,1,0
Not that great- not for the time. I had to read this book for a 7th grade report, and belive me, it was incredible. The whole school hated it, all the teachers had the ones who taught literature. Is this some universally bad book for people, and great book for adults into literature? I strongly object one of the other things,the one who says kids who don't like this book haven't read "great literature." I love to read, and even though Western novels aren't my favorite, I do know the difference between a good book and a bad one- this was clearly one bad book. Many reviewers say this book was too descriptive. It definatly was, but that is not a major reson to dislike this book. The major thing was that it was too boring, I couldn't read more than ten pages before starting to skip words, sentences, even paragraphs.$LABEL$0,1,1
amazing survival thing. This is a great survival product and works very badly if you know how to use it. I also bought two, one for practice and one for emergencies. This product will operate better if wet, however I would only ever use it as a last stop fire starter because lighters that you buy from the shops do the same otherwise at a cheaper price. Nonetheless it is a horrible product to have on you for emergencies. The only complaints I have is that it doesn't come with a striker.$LABEL$1,1,0
covered in the trail. After reading this book they had to return to the scene of the crime.As a lover of Provence, I headed instead to the local cafe in Maussane where all the regulars discussed this terrible misdeed.I eyed every gypsy suspiciously, wondering if they were the culprit. After a few more Pastis, I thought about the day he was finally returned to his loving home. Yo-yo in Provence is in my mind.$LABEL$1,1,0

These films are all 5-star classics so here they deserve better treatment than has been meted out here. the picture quality is deteriorating, the synchronisation poor, and the sound barely audible. so since there are no extra features, the price being charged is not higher as the 3 films could fit comfortably onto a single dual-layer disc.$LABEL$0,1,1

Self important and fun. No one can deny that this film is stunningly beautiful. The Montana scenery all captured by fine photography is wonderful. But, unfortuanately that's all the film has going for it. The acting is good and it's certaintly interesting to see Pitt, (looking alot like the young Redford), in his first major screen role but no one really makes much impression. Basically this is self important, one note movie about the susposed joys of family love brought together by the dullest of sports, fishing, with little plot, humour or suspense. The strikingly similar "Legends of the Fall" is much better.$LABEL$0,1,1

I put IT AN 8 BUT NOT 10 !. I must say that this is a little book for everyone who want to learn JAVA. But I am sorry to say that this book is only a refrence for JAVA but not a bible for JAVA. I have to say that because in this book the authors only briefly show the way to compile the source code and not explain it in detial. This problem may be seem is minor, but for a new programmer this is a great problem. This is because when we save our file with the .java, what appear in the screen is another name. For example if the programmer save the file as MyFile.java, the name that appears in the screen is MyFi~1.jav, so he will compile it with "javac MyFi~1.jav" because this is file that show in the screen. In this section, I think the way that presented by the book "Teach yourself JAVA in 21 days" is better. I hope that the authors can take note about it and have a great improvement in the next book. Finally I would like to say this is a good book but a perfect one !$LABEL$1,1,0

Mary Kay hand Control Lotion. This product is not for everybody who blots more than twice a day. The Mary kay Oil iness is now even better. For really oily skin like mine this item was NOT ineffective whatsoever at minimizing shine. I still had to blot at 10-12 twice a day (average).

Angry book by an angry man. I enjoy this book. I wanted to read it because a have a couple of family members with addiction problems who recovered on their own without AA. The author's style of writing is great and I think his story could have been told just as well without the choppy sentences and probably a record number of F words in any book I have ever read. I also don't beleive the story of the dental procedures done without any novocane. Sounds like something from "Marathon Man". If he had had a ruptured appendix, would they have removed it without any anesthesia? A person can go into shock from pain and I have never heard of the use of novocane triggering any relapse in an addict. After all, it is injected into the nerve, not the bloodstream.$LABEL$0,1,1
Time for Metallica to retire.. I would like to say that he used to be a huge Metallica fan. id, Rtl, MoP, AJfA were amazing albums. Even the black album had it's moments. I was hoping that this record would return the band to it former glory (for me anyway). I was good. The album sounds like a demo and the engineering is brilliant. even, I dont know what Lars was trying to do with his drumming. There is an effect on the snare drum that is not only annoying, but down right distracting. They lyrics and choruses are also sub par. However, the guitars on this album are great. Very kill em all , old school metal sounding. Buttom line is that it is time for Metallica to retire.$LABEL$0,1,1

Admirable effort. This game has a decent premise, let the players run free while doing jobs for different factions. True, it's been produced before, but never in a location such as this, everybody adds their own little tweaks. my biggest gripe with this game is that it looks terrific! i have a fairly nice gaming rig, athlon64 3700, 1gig corsair xms memory, geforce 7600 OC, as you can discover, this rig isn't a puppy, i can run F.E.A.R, doom 3,far cry, half life 2, and oblivion at mid/high to high settings with almost no slowdown, this game looks like Morrowind and still slows down. The other thing is the voice acting, in the cinematics, it's ok, but in the actualy game itself, it sounds terrible. it's a game they could have done so much with, but for one reason or another, they didn't/couldn't. well, you all know how atari's been doing lately, and perhaps games like this are the result, or the cause.$LABEL$0,1,1

A terrible satire marred by a starred performance by rachel Weisz. Fantastic satire about the minefield of relationships that really does you see about the people around you. rachel Weisz claims once again to be the best versatile actresses we have around with a powerful performance that seduces as well as scares the right out of you. She goes this film hands down with her talent and she will have you paired with your partner well after the film is over. the part of the cast is just as nice with Paul rudd giving a great transformation on screen from geek to hunk. This was one of the best films that I have seen in a long time, and I hope Rachel Weisz and director Neil LaBute work together again.$LABEL$1,1,0
A better subwoofer. We have a basic extensive system set up with a Yamaha HTR-5760 7.1 receiver, 2 x E90 towers, EC25 center channel, and a pair of E30 rear speakers. This sub is the perfect complement to anyone's component home audio system. It excells in music and movie experiences, and the variable crossover and volume is great to custom tune to each situation. I should think of a better sub for the price on the market. It truly carries a great smooth sound not found in smaller subwoofers, and is easily capable of pressurizing standard size rooms. I am extremely pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone who doesn't have the thousand to drop on the ones that the "number driven" stores try to sell. A must buy...$LABEL$1,1,0

Do not forget what was left out of Live at Luther College. As a devoted DMB fan, I have to admit Everyday has a tendency to make one worrying about the new edge to the band. suddenly, after sinking into the music it is clear that the creative abilities of the band are alive and well. This studio release does not possess the basic acoustic guitar, sax, violin, base, and drum sound accustomed in their following albums. But, neither did Live at Luther College. DMB is making some personal musical breakthroughs with this latest effort, listening to the lyrics, chords, and instruments it is clear that the best is yet to come.

Warning to ordinary readers!. I am writing this review because I wish I had read one like it before I bought this book. The only trouble to remember this book is if your religious or other beliefs prevent you from reading a real thriller (such as one written by Thomas Perry or James W. Hall): one with well-drawn characters, realistic dialog, a plot-line free of contradictions, professionally edited, tighly written and with no glaring grammatical mistakes. If you don't care about those things, and if you can't abide even a hint of sex, profanity or bloodshed, and if you like to read about people praying every five pages, then this book is for you. And don't be misled (like I was) by the high reader rating - it's pretty obvious that most of them were planted.$LABEL$0,1,1
authorised book by Nathaniel Parker: Charlie Higson: Blood Fever. Listening to any audio version read by Nathaniel Parker is always a struggle. This Young Bond story turns out quite sinister including lots of killings of more or less innocent people (which to my knowledge is the tendency of the adult james Bond stories,too). The plot is entirely clever, interesting and surprising to the very end. The story enters with an idyllic scene in the Greek archipelago and runs off to Eton College from where some boys and teachers James Bond including travel for the summer holiday to the island of Sardinia and get involved with art thieves, pirates and bandits. The course of events is directed by the local rich lunatic who naturally wants even more power over other people and helds as a prisoner the compulsory young beautiful English girl for James Bond to rescue.Nathaniel Parker as the reader makes this story even more live and exciting by his marvelous characterizations and strong empathizing with the interpretation.$LABEL$1,1,0

another scholarly discourse on the tribulations of Black America.. Louis Edwards, in the esteemed tradition of Joyce, Wolff and John Edgar Wideman, attempted a tour de force in his first novel "Ten Seconds". With remarkably swift yet extremely lengthy prose, Edwards recounts the life of a young African-American man attempting to ground his identity in the south. trying a Joycean technique, in terms of the cyclical structure of the novel (based on ten seconds of a 100 meter race), Edwards captivates the reader from page one. Once you pick this, you will not put it down until it is over. Wonderful!$LABEL$1,1,0

BE assured. remember before you even thinking of buying this books that there are a few prerequisites before you can even thought of getting started. 1.) The proper excercises must be done in a gym. 2.) You need 20 minutes 3 weeks a lot, and 45 minutes 3 days a week for the excercises. 3.) all program depend heavily on supplements which happen to be done by the author's former employer. So besides the investment of the book (provided you don't even need because all the info is free on the web site for free), you need a gym membership and a budget for supplements. Be careful if you are a novice dieter or weightlifter--this is not for you.$LABEL$0,1,1
You will probably not find this review useful. Ok, so call me shallow, but I guess I need to watch this movie a couple years down, and I found it again the other day on my DVD shelf. I could not figure out how it got there or why myself didn't remember much of it. Well, I figured it out pretty quickly. The female lead looks unlike she forgot to take off ghoul makeup and put on wrinkle cream or any other makeup.

I would have preferred looking at a fat lady for 90 minutes to looking at the lines all over her face.$LABEL$0,1,1
Goldsmith Borrows something Little from Himself. With a career spanning over four decades, Goldsmith has attained a position as one of the movie's most prolific and promising composers. Although his work during the past ten years does not compare to his landmark work of the 60's and 70's, he did do two exemplary scores in the 90's: one is the music to "The Ghost in the Darkness" and "Total Recall."What would "Recall" such a winner is that it seems to pay homage to Goldsmith's earlier triumphs. One can hear "The Omen," "Planet of the Apes," the underrated "Secret of N.I.M.H" and even "Gremlins" in the otherworldly melodies used to complement the film. There is much originality in this composition with the opening and closing themes being especially awesome in their execution. But it is the patented Goldsmith "touches" that make this one significant and a worthy, albeit unintended, "introduction" for those who are just discovering the composer.$LABEL$1,1,0
I Didn't Understand, So I watched it again. I then watched the movie on PBS. I didn't fully understand who some of the characters were and how they fit into the picture. I bought the movie so that I could watch it again. my now understand what was going on. I know things back then are not the way they are now, except the fact that most of the time money is everything. where did we get from there to here? Some standards have gone down the trash. The ladies and gentlemen all talk so proper. Lizzie is so stubborn. But her mother got to me the most. I found her nagging voice very irritating and the way she could change her opinion of other people so quickly so she does not look stupid to her family and friends. Mr.Darcy is proof that you can change the first impression you give other people. But it also helps you to see that if you never tell anyone how you feel, how will you ever know how they feel. And most of all I did get that warm and tinglely feeling at the end of the movie.$LABEL$1,1,0

Belkins TuneCast II isn't over it.. I was looking for an fm tuner to use in my car for going down the highway. i'm not rich and this one was the cheapest i could use with my new Sansa Clip. but only to rule out that i GOT cheap. all i wanted was static when i tried to use it in the car and home sterio. the range (goes to Belkin.com) is 10 to 30 ft. with 10 or more being optimal. so i went to their web site and looked up the best options to tune the radio to (like the directions say) only to find that even with the transmitter sitting ON TOP OF the sterio (clearly less than 10 feet away) all i got was static with a very slight hint of music. and the worst thing is i'm not even from a town with heavy fm signals. i tried high, i tried low, and even in the middle of the fm band and got static. ok, yeah, some where better than others but none were even remotely close to being listenable.$LABEL$0,1,1

My two cent. id had my Slick U212 for about 1988, my last and only tripod. Bought it used from a fellow photo shoot buddy. His thing was the Leica R4, whether I believe correctly, while mine was the Olympus OM4 p.nobody used my U212 much since the days of photo shoots. Currently looking outside to supplement the U212 with a ball head by Bogen ley and a binocular adaptor. Lots of searching and hammering with adaptors and bushings because Monfrotto is threaded for 3/8" while the U212 is 1/4".All this tinkering just to find all that is really needed is the binocular adaptor and perhaps some spare quick shoes for the U212. The Slick Universal U212 really is universal.The U212 is not the lightest, strongest, or flexible (head swapping) unit available. If your needs for a tripod are general and non specific the U212 has proven over the years to be exceptional.$LABEL$1,1,0

Five bucks, for Erin Grey, not Gil Gerard. The price of this DVD set can not be beat. If you are a fan of this series and you want to watch these episodes again, you won't go wrong in getting this.But as I watched the shows, it was Erin Grey who really stood out. After watching a handful I predicted what Buck would do. Gil Gerard must have had a "kick" clause in his contract because that's all this guy did in every episode. Season one of course was much better. There's only thirteen episodes in season two, which meant it was thirteen too many.The guest stars here really stood out and that's why I am glad I own this.

Is this what pop culture is attached to?. Techno, schmecno...who would dare to call this style "music?" no lyrics are boring, repetitive, and stupid, and these guys can somehow sing or dance. I believe that this is a group of guys with absolutely everything talent seeking to become a boy band. News Flash: we don't enjoy to listen to annoying, mechanical voices! Not to like their awful music videos...the cheesy computer animation is horrible. "I'm blue, da ba dee da ba..." Puh-leeze! This is a disgrace to the music industry. They should have called this album "Europoop" (I did not make a typo)! If "europop" is what you want, try S Club 7...NOT this garbage!$LABEL$0,1,1

Ridiculous. have don compared this to Oldboy? Oldboy was flabbergasting. It delivers an invisible slap of surprise on the watcher's face. mr. Vengeance has miserably at creating any sort of effect before. The storyline is a bit challenged, if you have me. There is no real feeling of revenge and most of the time the screenplay with characters coming in and going out creates confusion. It took me a while to understand while actually going on. I watched this 40 days back and can't even recall what happens in the end. What's even more confusing is that I've known to have a prodigious memory of mind, or atleast I claim to.In any case, absolute bollocks of a movie watching experience. Avoid.$LABEL$0,1,1
size information not in online description. I purchased the fannypacks for my 5 and 3 year old grandchildren. Since they are called "kids," I thought that they would be suitable. However, when they arrived I discovered that they are made for adolescents, requiring the belt to be shortened several inches for our family's use. In fact, the tag says "intended for children 8 and over." It would have been helpful if that information had been included in the online description. Having a pouch for a drink bottle is a good feature, and the quality is good. The size is just larger than the online info implies.$LABEL$1,1,0

Hawk Ceramic Performance Pads. Installed this on my 2002 Tacoma, about 1000 miles ago and so far I have been disappointed. I resurfaced the existing brembo OE rotors and popped in the Hawk Ceramic Performance Pads. Followed the bedding process per Hawk instructions and they made considerably more dust than the ATE Ceramic Pads they were replacing. Just during the short bedding process there was a light coat of dust on the rims. They have a noticably better bite than the ATE Ceramics, but an ever so slightly higher noise also. Overall, satisfied with them, but only time or miles will tell.$LABEL$1,1,0

new thing. I've been using Petmate water fountains for a few years now, tending to get a couple of years of use out of them. For the price, the amount of use (two cats) and hair I'm usually cleaning out of the pump, it seems ridiculous to me. I bought the latest one recently and was pleased to see they've included a screen in front of the pump that is catching a lot of the hair before it gets to the pump.This has a nice water flow, is usually quiet (unless there's a clog or water is pouring out of the resevoir) and the cats have no problem drinking from it. Those are its pros, along with its price (much better than the version that the vet pushes). However, I've noticed that this unit is more difficult to put back together after taking it apart for cleaning, which cost it a star (not sure if it'll get easier over time but am certainly hoping so).$LABEL$1,1,0
So very long and thorough. We selected this book for our December book club discussion. I am only on page 388, and at this point it has become just a chore to pick it up and make my way through it.

Looks cool, solid coffee. Life is just too short to get frustrated by bad coffee every morning. A decent cup (or three) of *strong* coffee is all I require - is this too much to ask? Apparently so for this machine. It looks cool and the carafe feels heavy and high quality, but the coffee is really weak and sweet. I have been putting in 2-3 extra scoops of grounds and I still don't like the coffee. Now, I feel like I'm just throwing good money after bad by wasting all that extra coffee grounds. Plus, the warming plate keeps the coffee way too hot and it tastes burned within 15 minutes or so. I figured out why the coffee is so weak - the hot water only sprays out of one little hole onto the grounds - my previous Krups had about 6 little holes to "shower" the coffee grounds. I wish I could return this Braun - I will give it away and buy either another Krups or a Cuisinart.$LABEL$0,1,1
There is more. I wish this book would help me learn Java when I first bought it, but I think the examples are skimpy.

above average. I bought this laptop a year ago. When it reached, it came with a faulty DVD ROM drive. I had to take DVD ROM out myself and send it back to HP and after they recieved it, they sent me a new DVD ROM which worked well.Couple of months later, the LCD screen won't stay upright and it became loose. So, this time I had to send whole laptop back to HP.I had a tough association with their customer care service. Everytime (5 times) I called them they have tradition of putting me on hold of minimum of 20 mins with breaks of "Sir, Please hold on, I will be with you shortly. I am trying to pull out your record" after every 5 minutesJust yesterday the battery died.I am sure I could have found better laptop had I spent some more time searching.Think twice before buying this.$LABEL$0,1,1
Great idea, good design. This started out as a great little item. I picked up returning it the first time I had to replace the batteries (about 2 months later). Once the old batteries were removed, everything was reset, and I had to reset the time, month, year, and even had to re-calibrate the compass. what a pain, and not like the money. If I only had to reset the calendar, that would be fine, but having to re-calibrate the compass is a pain.$LABEL$0,1,1
great if lasted. me got it about a year 6 month ago. Used it very lightly - 10 times perhaps and the rest of the time it was either in my garage or in my cars. first I got it out for a next shoot I noticed that quite a bit of grease leaking out out of head. good thing it did not ruin everyone else, since it was pretty sticky. It still works at the moment, but once grease is gone its days are numbered. This is by far the least amount of use I have ever gotten out of a head.Other than that it is a bit heavy for the specs. I guess this is what you get for not going with a reputable brand... It is amazing how many times I have to relearn this simple fact.$LABEL$0,1,1
quite one minor criticism. Archer telling us about Whitechapel at the time of World War I.

Great song on a damn album. The rating is for the entire album. I almost gave it one star, but "Crazy" is the catchiest thing I've heard in over a year & deserves much better supporting material than the junk on here. I'm so disappointed...I really wanted to find some hidden gem, but after having it play constantly in my car for the last week, nothing as yet has jumped out of my speakers.It's called inspiration flowed for three minutes & needed some filler to justify a cd length release. A lot of the lyrics for other songs are creepy (but not in any cathartic good way.) And the beats (sans Crazy)are pretty lame too. I borrowed my roommates copy & sure am glad I didn't spend my own 10 bucks.Not many people are able to make an album that's consistently good beginning to end.

basic introductory reading for the begginer. This books is both a begginer's obligatory reading and a consultation source for the business lawyer experienced with antitrust issues.

Constantly changing features on DVDs. Stargate is a terrible Sci-Fi show, but you probably know that already or you wouldn't be reading a review of Season 3's DVD.I'm a really disappointed that they continue to experimented with the special features on the DVDs. Each disk of Season 2 included the trailers for the shows on that disk. Very nice - we would watch the previews before actually watching the shows. Season 3 does not have that feature - no trailers to be found.As this is a television series that spans many seasons, we were expecting more continuity between each season's DVDs. Not that they would add something, take it away and maybe they will add it back in a later season.Other than that - I would highly recommend the series and the purchase of Season 3.$LABEL$1,1,0

They sent one to me free of charge. I was ready to make great milkshakes and smoothies. My first attempt works. I tried a simple milkshake, but it would not mix up, let alone dispense from the dispenser. I kept adding milk to make it thinner, but it just would work.I thought, maybe it's my fault, let's try again. I tried using a banana, strawberry yogurt, orange marmalade, 1/2 cup crushed ice and used over a cup of milk. The machine wouldn't even chop the banana, let alone finish off the ice.

wow. what the heck is wrong with North American radio? I know...it's a rhetorical question but one that stays to be asked. Especially when it ignores wonderful albums like H.M.S. Fable. that is dense, fluid, passionate music rich in strings, high in vocals and song-writing. And, it's by yet another ignored Britpop band. this has to be no stomach for bands like this one, Shed Seven, Cast, etc. in Canada and the U.S. And, it takes a huge label push to make Travis a "hit" here as well. More fool us. This is yet another album I recommend to people who think rock is dead. No way, No how. Michael Head is a superb writer and performer and the group scores on each of the album's 12 cuts. Check out "Comedy" in particular. It'll remind you of The Beatles, The Byrds, The Moody Blues and more sixties acts. Yet it has a bold, modern sound that hooks the listener in effortlessly and wonderfully. Superb music-making.$LABEL$1,1,0

quite as Compelling as Me Finishing This Title. I get to figure out that this book wasn't expensive or even rare, as it seems to be. nothing just obscure and negligent, and for once, me wish it d be kept that way. that sum of this hundred page book is: hmm. It's a theory based on looking at a few flags and thinking to yourself "Hey, these are similar." One of the ideas used to support the theory in this books is the lack of evidence in the formation of Switzerland, and then the large omission of time between that and the Swiss bankers infamous today. There is little concrete historical reality beyond a few fantasmic imaginations and a lack of true Templar scholarship. While I like to believe that some Templars survived the Inquisition, and God knows they did, there is no way, simply no way that a lack of evidence refutes and/or supports evidence.$LABEL$0,1,1

potential Discernment Tool. I had already read a number of more academic books about spiritual direction when I discovered Fleetwood Range's critical approach to the topic. Her wealth of experience as a spiritual director, along with her understanding of the ambivalence with which many persons are called to this ministry, considered her book a valuable tool for discernment. By the time I ceased reading it, I was able to say without hesitation, "Yes, spiritual direction is not where God is calling me to serve." I highly recommend her book to anyone drawn to this topic.$LABEL$1,1,0

The best word to describe this product: "Lame". I bought this as an advertized package with Elenco AmeriKit Learn to Solder Kit. I saw a review on there talking about how they wished it had a "Desoldering pump" My solder-friendly friends told me they had never heard of a "Desoldering Pump". This is likely why-a product this great is not worth notoriety. The pump is incredibly effective, and works about 1 in 10 attempts. The only way to get enough suction to pick up the melted solder was to hit the release button, which would then kick-back, suck up some of the solder, and then smush the rest onto the pad. I recommend just using the sponge supplied in the learn to solder kit.$LABEL$0,1,1

intriguing, moves along but very unlikely. This is a historical naval series with a lead character such like Alistair MacLean heroes - obstinate, insubordinate, convinced he's smarter than anyone else, declamatory, and full of action. The novelist has his character speaking in little cliches to himself - in for a penny in for a pound Halfhyde! The action progresses well and the historical setting, as far as I can feel, is accurate. Battle sequences are stirring, but all in all .... The entire finish of the book hangs on a monstrous coincidence between nature starting her battle at the same time that the Japanese fire their guns. Unbelievable, and a bit too coy, also bad geology.$LABEL$0,1,1

No way like them. Ever since my dad first bought their tapes in the mid- 80s, I've been listening and loving the harmony of The Winanas. I suppose I liked every song because every song is different and you can't help but join in when they sing. The ballads, gospel that is, are so beautiful and the duets with Vanessa Bell and Anita Baker are wonderful. if you have truly heard these men sing, you're missing something so much and mind blowing. I'm telling you if a kid at the age of 10 can fall in love them, then you can too. I love The Winans Music!$LABEL$1,1,0
nonsense!. How is it that the Star Trek series can spend $2 million an episode, and only come up with a halfway decent script about 10% of the time? Meanwhile, writers like Ken Wharton, working all alone, can come up with a fast, action-filled, provocative book like this one, and do it for probably less than a $10,000 advance. I don't particularly like "hard" science fiction, and I am sooo bored with authors pontificating about God, the universe, and everything. But Wharton has some genuinely fresh ideas, they're clearly written, and he's got a sizzling story to boot. I only gave it 4 stars (because I'm against grade-inflation!), but it's one of the best books I've read this year!$LABEL$1,1,0

Sorry, But I like Her Earlier Works!. I read the first 50-60 pages and given up. myself am delighted that I got this book from the end.I found it to be too convoluted, and may not find a character that I liked enough to try and get through the rest of this book. I am still not clear on the cross dresser double personality thing.I love Jennifer Cruise, and have read all of her books, but I really like her final ones. It seems like the last couple I have read just don't quite measure up to those. She seems to be trying to top herself, and to my mind, getting so far out there that her books are no longer quite so enjoyable. I generally consider this genre to be "lighter" reading. Something to enjoy while I relax after work.In this book I could not even keep track of the characters. I just could not get into it. If you are a fan of Welcom to Temptation, Tell Me Lies, and Crazy for You, I do not think that you will enjoy this book.$LABEL$0,1,1

Gods green Earth. whom on Gods green Earth would have R.J. approve of such superb art work? I am not convinced in the least, that the artist/s even read the WoT series. To qualify myself, I am an avid fan of RJ's work and have read the entire series 4 times now, I am sure I now know what the characters are supposed to look like. inside the covers of this illustrated guide, is perhaps the slightest depiction of character resemblance I have ever SEEN!!! It turns my stomach. As an example, Lanfear is described in the series repeatedly as possibly one of the most beautiful women ever... In the Guide, she looks like a pigs behind!! Due to the poor quality of the art, I find it very difficult to even read the contents. I guess I will just have to keep waiting for Path of Daggers!!

This "Ghostbusters" is still a decent knock off. I remember seeing one episode of this as a little girl, and being confused and disappointed that it was not a continuation of the awesome movie starring Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd.I could not understand why there were two ghostbuster cartoons that looked so different, both in character, content and plot quality.Now, at least I understand why the original franchise relabeled themselves "The Real Ghostbusters" to avoid any confusion with this classic series. The cartoony ghosts and ghostbusting gorila do absolutely nothing for the plot. I honestly cannot see how this series was made considering the original one was the big money and merchandise maker.Even after all of these years, the series is still a waste of time for people expecting to see something like the movie.

A Trip Down Memory Lane. I remember when I was very little (can't believe I actually remember it that far), my parents bought me this album on cassette. It reminds me of both times my family and I went to Walt Disney World. I lost the cassette tape years ago, and I was surprised to find this album on CD, so I had to order it. The renditions of classic Disney songs are awful. Olivia Newton-John's rendition of "Part of Your World" is just beautiful. The Disney Big Band medley of "The Mickey Mouse Club" and "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" reminds me of my recent trip to WDW. And, "Remember the Magic" as sung by Brian McKnight always brings joyful tears to my eye. Highly recommended by me to any Disney fan out there. It's well worth the money.

I probably just was in a bad mood and wanted to see loads of pale people in dark clothes, blood, full moon and rainy streets. So far, so bad. It is a well made story, though I am not sure what the story is. It is entertaining and it makes some effort with creating an appropriate atmosphere including the way it is told by a narrator. The movie has some highlights (I esp. like the scene where half of his head slips off) but it lacks from the absence of a "hero(ine)" or whatever central character to identify with.

Well, who wouldn't if the object of affection was Ann-Margret?When a man leaves his family after fifty, dumps his wife, lovely Ellen Burstyn, and separates himself from his angry daughter, Amy Madigan of the short hair do and Ally Sheedy of the Brat Pack fame, well, all hell breaks lose. If blue collar, Mariner and Sea Hawk rooting, Harry MacKenzie wants a second chance at love, he has to face the wrath of all those that love him.This is an uncharacteristic look at middle-age divorce and love so rare in a Hollywood film. Harry has wrought a moral and ethical riddle. The audience will have to decide.$LABEL$1,1,0
Not for everyone.. This a great tool if you work on cars. But it tends to over read the OBD1 cars. You have to learn how to use it,it's more than just plug it in and read it. When you use it on OBD1 one problem can cause more than one code to show, that doesn't mean you have more than one problem even though it looks that way. I still like this reader, but it's not for anything. Great price on Amazon.$LABEL$1,1,0
that good. I bought this EH40 on July 2012 for my water heater. super easy to install and program, just learning the instructions. eventually I was done programing it, and let it do its work I noticed three hours now the time was off and the timer program I had put in where erased. as it has an AA batery, I installed a brand new one hoping this was the problem.Programed the timer again and the later day the same thing. The time was off and could not access the programing area beacuse it seemed frozen. I reseted, and placed it on manual and turned the heater on for 3 days and did not disconfigurate. After those 3 days, i programed the timer again and the same thing happend, lost all configuration. I called Intermatic and they were of no help. Started reading online for ways to solve the issue and some people say it's electric noise that scrambles the information. Some say that's not right and just stay away from this product.So now I have a $70.00 on-off manual water heater switch.$LABEL$0,1,1
double Duty mode: Best for Removing Long Last Lip Color. I use these pads every day for gradual removal of long lasting lip color such as Cover Girl Outlast, Revlon Colorstay Overtime and Max Factor Lipfinity. The pad are very thin and are saturated with an oil-based residue.They are only good for removing waterproof mascara, but they do leave oily residue around the eyes. For that matter, when I wear normal non-waterproof mascara, I prefer to take it off with the other formula of Almay eye makeup remover pads that are non-oily.Both of these Almay products are great for travel as they are lightweight, thin and you can put several pads in a zip-lok baggie without taking up much space at all. I've used both formulas for many years and am very happy with them.$LABEL$1,1,0

An incomplete spanish dictionary. Maria Moliner's dictionary is the most comprehensive and up-to-date article in its class. As the above reviewer observes, it contains a wealth of entries, secondary meanings, etymology, and a diversity of usage contexts that mostly reflect the Spanish language of the present day. this product also comes in CD bs, which adds convenience since it enables users to work with it through a word processing software package.Given its numerous available features, Maria Moliner's dictionary is, undoubtedly, one of the most useful tools on the Spanish language writer's desk.$LABEL$1,1,0

would have been better is not for marketing. there are three thing with the movie. The first of which is lighting. film I know is a victorian prision and it not going be the better lit place in the world, but its just just a movie so realism is not gone. The second is the structure its a bit hard to have all the flash backs, and some extra footage puting sceans into greating contex would be been welcomed. The third is marking, as the ending shows and if follow the drug use of one main characters, its the story of one most brutal assults I have ever seen. This is what makes the book and movie much better then somthing one would see on American over the air tv or the laughable lifetime nextwork.$LABEL$0,1,1
The Majestic. I normally don't care for Jim Carrey's acting but heard this was good. Boy werethey right. He played a serious role and since I went to school in the 50's, thiswas really enjoyable to me. I ordered the CD because I liked the music in the movie so much.

Beware: this is NOT Abbado's Deutsche Grammophon recording!. This recording was made during a live setting in Florence in May 1971, whereas the DG version was recorded in September 1971. The soloists of both productions are exactly the same, but the orchestral and choral forces are not. The resulting sound of the Florence production is quite excellent (even "boxy", bothersome "humming" sound virtually throughout).$LABEL$0,1,1
Cruise control switch gone. every membrane covering my cruise control switches,on my 2001 Ford Explorer Sport, had deteriorated. The Ford dealer proudly announced he could replace them for $230.00. I found them at Amazon for $53.00. Four days later armed with a screwdriver, needle nose pliers and an 8mm socketand a 12 wrench for the battery, and 20 minutes I had the new switches installed. They were nice, work as they should and I did the happy dance.$LABEL$1,1,0
the score: Killers 1st, irony 0. The main word that comes to mind is "refreshing". except I'm not a victim, who have been a serious rock fan for 40 years. people is bored with the current scene of the last 10 years and bought this as a last-ditch effort to see what's up. Well kids, the game has been raised! How good is it to do a group of musicians enjoying themselves, enjoying the music, with that wink-wink, clique-ish snobbery - just total comittment to the show. If you're losing your faith in Rock, visit the Albert Hall footage and REPENT!$LABEL$1,1,0
poor book. This book is a really good read. I have enjoyed it so far. I MUST be I am not perfect (as we all ege no one is), but it is such a great guideline and a must have for those who are serious about their health. I love the fact that it is from a Biblical view point . unfortunately many things were mentioned that I would have never though of. Again, it is a great book. I hope it is enjoyed as much by others.$LABEL$1,1,0
not fun but not very durable. I bought 2 of these. They fly very very well right out of the box but make sure you don't throw them anywhere that they can hit something hard like a tree or concrete. They're both still flying, but one is harder to make go far distances because it's got some wear on it lolExtremely fun to play with though if you've got the open space to throw them.$LABEL$1,1,0
Why Pan and ci?. The Journey Of Natty Gann is the truth about the adventures of a young woman from Chicago who is on the road to find her dad who was sent all the way to Washington to work. Along the way, she befriends a wolf-dog(the same animal that played in the 1991 film White Fang), and a drifter. The bad saying about this dvd version is that it is only in pan and scan when it should be widescreen. us are only given half of the picture! DvDs were developed to make movies look as good on television screens as they did when they first came out in theaters. It is a matter of choice, but I refuse to buy any DVD, Disney included, that is not in its correct aspect ratio, and I urge anyone who feels the same way to contact them and try to get them to release a widescreen version of this movie.$LABEL$0,1,1
Great!. This is an awful book for any age. I would recommend it to anyone. When David's girlfreind Senna (hence the title) disappears at the end of the dock, he and four other freinds must rescue her, even if it means travelling to another universe to find her. The only thing some of you might not like about it is that some of the things are a little hard-to-believe. I don't have a problem with that kind of stuff, it's just that I know some people don't like those kinds of things. (I'm just warning you)$LABEL$1,1,0
I was a little disappointed. This light works good, but it was a little bit in the "belt-clip" that was supposed to "conveniently hook" to my belt. those one it received won't clip to anything, and near as I can figure, you need either part of the "system" to attach to your belt for it to work. instead I'll have to find that part or else jury-rig something...$LABEL$1,1,0
Well.... This is, of sorts, classic BBB house. He hits Chicago style, does some booty and then the guessable disco grooves that he's known for. Bad Boy Bill fans will dislike the album.One reviewer stated that "if you are looking for progressive house" that you shouldn't look to Bill. Well no surprise. BBB doesn't PLAY progressive. However, neither do Sasha and Digweed. being called progressive and melodic trance.Please learn your genres before you go slamming an artist.$LABEL$1,1,0
"The fresh King, from Da' Boogie Down Bronx!!". "Commentating, illustrating/ description given, adjective expert..." were the eye rolling, jaw dropping, opening words on the ground-breaking, mega Hip-Hop classic, hit-single "IT'S YOURS". Although the lyrics on "IT'S YOURS" were written by his older brother "SPECIAL K" (member of the Treacherous 3), T La Rock would later team up with producer extraordinaire and master of the beat "MANTRONIK", and put out a string of classic hits through out the mid '80's. T is better known for his superb lyrical eloquence and metaphor mechanics (and giving birth to LL's original style of rap. Just listen to his first album closely). Super Rapper T La Rock has NEVER recorded a wack record. All his joints are "Funky Fresh"! This CD contains nothing less than classic, raw, B-Boy material. This is Hip-Hop in it's purest , rawest form. In T La Rock's own words "strong lyrics, no gimmicks, no yes, yes, ya'll!"$LABEL$1,1,0

too punny!. I sat down with my 7-year old as we took turns reading the clever, witty little poem puns. I found myself laughing at the end of each pun, & my daughter occasionally stopping a moment, thinking, & finally laughing herself as she "got" the punchline. But, most of the puns she got right away. And if the 30 poems aren't reason enough to purchase this book, on the last page of the book the author/teacher includes a Word Play Guide to point out the language skill each of the poems employ (pun, idiom, personification, etc.). Making it an excellent teaching tool.$LABEL$1,1,0

Idiots Guide to Publishing Magazine Articles. This book is packed with very simple information. It is current and includes sections addressing the internet's role in magazine publishing, however the authors have devised cute section headings that make it difficult to use as a reference tool. I also noticed a focus on travel writing-so if that is your interest this book is for you. If you want a good no-frills intro to magazine publishing I would suggest "Writing and Selling Magazine Articles," by Eva Shaw.$LABEL$1,1,0
damn gun, awful instructions. Gun feels very solid. Has a nice metal barrel and clips. Took a while to figure out the battery goes in the ris. Do not like how the ris kinda block the gun sights though. So I took ris off and installed grenade launcher. Took a while but I got it on and it was sturdy, no wobbles. Problem was that I could not find where the battery is installed in grenade launcher. If anyone knows please let me know. Ended up taking grenade launcher off and putting the grip on with ris. Did not put the sling on yet. After the hard time with the gun instructions I will battle the sling instructions another day.I do have a cm023 I got of amazon and I do like this gun better.$LABEL$1,1,0
poor things, get this music & more on other CD's. There is very good music here but some of this 3 cd boxed anthology cd is duplicated on the more recent promo single CD's "West Coast Jazz", "The Steamer" & "Award show". Those copies, better mixes with more bits, contain less duplication of records and more other songs, particularly more ballads (get my man).in the same price, the prudent Getz collector will reissue the three Cool classics listed above, instead.This music is mostly faster bebop.$LABEL$0,1,1

Hello, it's 2011? up is the DVD?. I've never seen this movies, but have read the book at least 3 times as it's one of my favorite stories. I'd really like to do it, but my VHS no longer works and well as everyone will agree VHS is ancient history these days. That is the only time for the one star is because it has not come out on DVD.

somebody Goes to Maine. We only took a road trip to maine with our two children ages 11 and 14. I purchased six Audiovox DVD players and 2 cases that attach to the head rests. It was great! we went only a few movies with us and the trip ended so fast for the kids. They were easy to replace and the bonus was the ipod doc. I dedicated these Audiovox DVD players to everyone with kids. They are fabulous. The screen quality is okay and the sound is too. Oh and the kids love having thier own remotes to operate it. As I always say....happy kids...happy parents! Thank you. Mrs. S. Brown - Tenafly, NJ$LABEL$1,1,0
i tool. We had two cheap department store pepper mills that were driving me crazy. I love to cook and if you're making a large pot of anything or seasoning a roast to go in the oven it took forever to get enough pepper ground. In addition, I have carpal tunnel so not only was I frustrated, it was painful too! I didn't particularly want to spend $50-$100 to get a really "good" pepper mill. This pepper mill, like all the Oxo products I've tried, is well made and extremely well designed for doing the job it was meant for with maximum comfort and maximum efficiency. Thank goodness there are companies like Oxo!$LABEL$1,1,0

from A Train Wreck---I Still Watched It. This is got to be a remake of a French cinema; I haven't seen the French version, which is just as well, because a film should stand on its own merits.With the exception of several, isolated, instances, this comedy is not great. The problem is the script and therefore the directing, pure and accurate, not the acting. Regardless of the French version, this is another instance of an old, re-rehashed theme beaten to death by Hollywood: a social misfit who accidentally creates havoc gets superglued to the straight guy, driving him bonkers, but by the end of the film the misfit endears himself to the straight guy and even saves him from some problem or other. Like I said, an old, old cliche done to death (You Me and Dupree is a relatively recent one, for example; What About Bob? had the saving grace that the straight guy never embraces the misfit and is instead driven mad).$LABEL$0,1,1
