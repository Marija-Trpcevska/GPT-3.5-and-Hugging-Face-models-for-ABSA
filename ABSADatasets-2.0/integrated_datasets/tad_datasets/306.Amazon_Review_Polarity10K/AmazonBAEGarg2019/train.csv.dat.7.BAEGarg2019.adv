Do yourself a favor, Check it out first. I would strongly urge anyone to check this product out before buying it.... This is one of the first we bought. It is very slow. Our bright enough baby was unable to establish any relationship between mouse movement and what happens on screen. The characters talk to the baby and tell her or him what to do. Babies do not get it. Our baby is now a toddler and this softwere is still useful. I suggest Reader Rabbit Baby, Reader Rabbit Toddler, or Sesame Street Baby and ME. Stay away from Sasame Street Toddler. It is very old, probably a Windows 3.1 progrem that needs a lot of updating.$LABEL$0,1,1

perfectly recommended for the Serious Backpacker. I wouldn't recommend this reading for the experienced backpacker or experienced dog owner. The rest of the author writes regularly for Dog Fancy... fine publication I am skeptical, but neither myself nor my dog are particularly fancy. some information is also broad (though I don't know what I expected for the price) and is not really applicable for everything other than the casual weekend trip or car-camp.since you are something resembling a regular backcountry traveler who enjoys the companionship and security of your mongrel and are looking practical tips on how to keep your dog healthy, safe and happy on the trail, look at other publications.If you have a monthly subscription to Dog Fancy and a collection of brand new backpacking gear, this might just be the book for you.$LABEL$0,1,1
have I loved this Song Before?. I like Alicia Keys, but I can always tell what artist she was playing to before she wrote/recorded this song. Even though I am young, I listen to music from the 50s, 60s and 70s. This song sounds a version of an Aretha song with some Donny in it. among other words, this song is something original at all!! myself do love the message of this song, but this sounds like a song I already heard before.$LABEL$0,1,1
not An Enriching Experience. They may have cut the overture and intermission, etc., but what was restored in the directors cut lengthens the original. And I don't really feel the previously edited songs have the experience. Just like my dislike of "Apocalypse Now Redux." A poor addition of far inferior scenes in my opinion. Fortunately, "1776" still remains a patriotic and historical delight. Almost like watching a stage production, another example of how film adaptations done right, can add to the limitations of stage scenery. Should be required viewing for school children of all ages.$LABEL$1,1,0

Don't buy with the remote control included. This unit should come with a corded remote control attached. However many resellers don't have the remote and sell it without.You'll have a tough time controlling the unit with it.

Pretty but amazingly Sturdy. I bought this a year ago and have had it constantly fall apart. It's very stylish and looks great, but the way the rack itself attaches to the wall mount is by one tiny little surface screw. The mount is secure in the wall, but the weight of the double towel rack bends the tiny screw its leaning on where it attaches to the wall-mount and falls down. mine even purchased larger surface screws that won't bend and that held it up for the past 6 months, but those are failing now too.Bottom line is that if you get a double rack (which is a worthy convenience) make sure to investigate how the rack attaches to the wall mount and that it is more than what you would use to attach a TP holder.Don't recommend this product, and subsequently the manufacturer.$LABEL$0,1,1

An Early warning Title. From the previous review I think this was the book published in the UK as Wilkins Tooth. It's a fun story about two children who run a 'Revenge Service' to make some pocket money. As you would expect in a childrens book the scheme backfires. It reminds me of 'Ogre Downstairs' as it's set in an apparently normal town where extra ordinary events occur. I'm not sure why it's been out of print for so long; many of the issues surrounding some bullies in the story could be helpful to schools today.$LABEL$1,1,0
anything special. I really don't understand all the hype about this movie. I am a personal fan of musicals, so its not the genre that bothered me. It is an entertainig and well executed movie, but not big beyond that. It sort of tricks you into thinking that its a good movie when really its considered flat. It has no message or theme, and you have really come to care about the characters. 20 time after I had left the theater I had forgotten all about the movie, definitely a sign of a bad movie.$LABEL$0,1,1
Earlier versions Definitely Better. while this is still a decent product, they have retained a number of the utilities that were offered in classic versions. When I asked Norton about this, their response was "You can uninstall the new version and reinstall the old one," which is like saying, "Oh, well, guess you wasted your money when you upgraded!" Norton claims to have taken away some utilities because they weren't being used. Hey, I used them, and I bet a lot of others did, too. All in all, I was very disappointed in the "upgrade" I bought.$LABEL$0,1,1

BIIG PIMPIN. ha, ive been waiting for this game to come out for a long moment, n yeah, secret of mana was awesome, so secret of mana is gonna be twice as good. ok. For one the game has no story line what so often, and u really don't get involved in even your own character. you just a sort of pointless five minute adventures that lead to no where. you also have got freedom of movement in the field world at all, its from one place to the next, no fighting. I'm sure all of your remember when your weapons get upgraded...well nope not in this game, which was one of my favorite options. Really i guess its the story line im disappointed in, i guess the first just won't be beat. I did have to give it two stars though because it gets kinda cool near the end when you get to do cool things with your "town". Overall id say that you'd be more satisfied with Superman64 or going to see Battlefield Earth.$LABEL$0,1,1
Shoulda paid more for something more.. I'm truly happy with this pressure cooker set. It takes a while to seal, and won't seal if it's not on high heat, so it's hard to make food you can burn, like rice. I think this is because it has safety features not found on old pressure cookers, but perhaps more expensive brands/models don't have this flaw. It's also nice to figure out how to use. The pressure valve label is confusing to some - the correct positioning is 180 opposite from what it appears. Only cooks at 8 psi and 12 psi, not 15 psi (250F), so it requires about 20% more cooking time (at 12 psi) than a 15 psi cooker. Didn't realize this when I bought it. For the $ I paid, it is OK. I wish I'd bought a better cooker; I'm pleased with the results.This is a copy of my review of theManttra Smart 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker. It seems the products are the same but for color, and I bought the silver one.$LABEL$0,1,1
This is a really decent movie; no refunds given at the door.. Curtis Hanson has made some very good movies(Bad Influence, LA Confidential, even Losin' It was cool), but this movie suffers from some kind of false scholastic irony and deadpan baby boomer humor that thinks can substitute for an entertaining story.Michael Douglas plays a loser. Tobey Maguire doesn't convince me that he is a genius underneath a loser exterior. And the absurd plot and weak relationships give the audience 120 minutes with no where to go.It is all a shame. This movie bombed for good reason.$LABEL$0,1,1
MDR-NC60 will Cancel Noise well. I had a pair of Maxell MAX190400 noise canceling headphones that broke. Instead of replacing them I thought I would try other noise canceling headphones. I bought (and returned) the following: Shure SE210, Sony MDR-NC60, and the Phillips headphones from Best Buy.The noise canceling on the Sony headphones is terrible. I work in an office that plays music that I don't like. I didn't expect total silence when wearing the Sony's, but the sound should be significantly decreased. However, I heard everything even though the NC feature was turned on. I just bought Maxell's HP/NCIV and they work much better and block out almost all noise. Don't waste your money and time with the Sony. If you really want noise cancellation get the Maxell.$LABEL$0,1,1
hmm..... This is a well written and clever book, and the author is very talented. The thing is, I'm a little irritated and bored by the story of a 20-something, commitment phobic, seemingly adolescent kind of guy who is such an emotional midget that he can't even say "I love you." The protagonist reminds me of the quintessential young (immature) single guy whose self destructiveness is matched only by his narcissism...the kind of guy women (girls?) really go for until they get a little older and grow a backbone. Harry's a horrible jerk until she draws a line in the sand...then he realizes how much he cares and wants her back...have all of us not lived or heard this scenario in some way a zillion times since we began dating? Are we not tired of it yet? Maybe I'm getting old...it's just not very cute or alluring anymore...it was hard for me to sympathize and consequently hard for me to stop rolling my eyes.$LABEL$0,1,1

It was amazing, it is really an expensive vacuum with exceptional parts and performance on carpet. you does adjust to go on hardwood, but it doesn't really do a great job there, also, the other attachements aren't designed to help you vacuum on any other surface, just for occasional detail work (short reach, no hard floor attachment).

When they started reading it my mind changed immedeatly!

once you are old and gray and full of sleep. . ..

Some of the "hacking" things that were claimed can, in fact, be done.However, not the way that was stated, and the reactions of everyone who do know computers (e.g. Angela) are truly unexpected.Also, almost everyone is acting out of principle.Angela can't believe Pelant was able to edit a video to change the timestamp.

I'd like that shower now, today.... is an amazing quote on the back cover of this book, something of the sort of, "Without obscenity, our cities are dreary places and life is bleak." And also agreeing - the Disneyfication of NYC 42nd Street to my taste rips the heart out of the city - I plunge in. it do I find? Nothing much that's terribly obscene, merely sorta sad and wonderful. a only thing that seperates it from a technically accomplished photodocumentation of a fratboy bachelor party is the mild millennial frisson the [gaijin] reader gets from the Tokyo floating-world setting. The Kenneth Starrs of the world (and there are lots, wouldn't you know) will find plenty to gasp at - "Look! She's got his penis in her mouth! Shocking!".

Hollywood Hogwash. The thrilling action sequences do not make up for the complete amount of historical accuracy, and anti-British tirade. Will American audiences swallow anything? The portrayal of a peace loving, patriotic, slave-freeing Hollywood hero is enough to make Ghandi vomit. Not that Mel Gibson is a bad actor, or the directing is poor, it's just that the message is absolute genius.I'm a student from England, and am particularly interested in the British Empire and the colonies in the Americas. But this portrayal of valiant and innocent rebels standing up to evil, Nazi-like redcoats is laughable. British soldiers burning people alive in a church? On what grounds do they base that? The American rebels were early terrorists, not freedom fighters. Half of Americans liked British rule and King George, bless them!See the film if you must, it's quite enjoyable, but dig out your history books later and learn a few home truths about the American revolution.

A beauty of Spanish + African ancestry, already incubating rabies, is pursued by a monk who was in his way to become a saint. Both the young woman and the monk fall for each other with a passion that challenges State and Church, the latter intent in destroying them through its instrument of terror, the Inquisition. They cannot win, of course, but they shake both structures. Her hair does not stop growing even after death. The estate of the decrepit Marquis and his love/hate relationship with his un-titled spouse of mixed origin are only surpassed by GABO himself in his Autumn of the Patriarch.$LABEL$1,1,0
Camp Counselor Needed Equipment!. When I was a camper, my counselor would read Tajar tales to me at night. I loved to hear about the misadventures of Tajar and when I was very young and had a very huge imagination, I swear I really did see Tajar right before I left camp! Now that I am a Girl Scout counselor (at the same camp I went to as a child) I continued the tradition and read Tajar Tales to my campers every night!$LABEL$1,1,0
am VERY HAPPY. I BOUGHT THE DYSON VACUUM AFTER HEARING SO MANY GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT AND READING ALL OF THE REVIEWS. I MUST SAY THAT WHILE IT DOES PICK UP A LOT OF DOG HAIR AND DIRT IN YOUR CARPET IT DOES NOT GET IT ALL. I HAVE A HOOVER WIND TUNNEL, AND I WENT BACK OVER WHAT I JUST VACUUMED WITH THE DYSON, AND IT PICKED UP A WHOLE CANISTER FULL OF DIRT AND DOG HAIR. SO WHAT CAN I THINK BUT I JUST WASTED A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY ON A VACUUM THAT I SHOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT, AND JUST STUCK TO MY HOOVER. THE CANISTER IS A LOT EASIER TO EMPTY ON THE DYSON VACUUM. BUT IN THE END I AM A LOT MORE CONCERNED WITH GETTING ALL OF THE DIRT AND HAIR OUT OF MY CARPET AND THIS DYSON MODEL DOES NOT DO IT.$LABEL$0,1,1

Respect and admiration for a brave bibliophile. Wow...this lady can READ! If she's read half of those she's recommended in two volumes, RE-read many of them, AND found the time to write these books-listing-books atop that, well...I'm truly impressed. That's a life well-lived in the world of reading.It's all a matter of opinion, but a few of her suggestions were outright bombs where I labored to get to page 10 (Amazon probably will strike me down for saying so, but thank God the library's free). Then again, there were a few which more than made up for them-and which I'd never have tried otherwise. I was delighted to find a few of my own favorites among her lists, and some that I'd found to be blatantly missing.The important thing is to keep reading once you find an author or a style you love. If it's not on Nancy Pearl's list, it could-and should-be on your own.$LABEL$1,1,0

Fine for killing time on a 5-hr flight, but mostly entertaining.... Grisham's "The Street Lawyer" won't keep you turning the book with excitement like his earlier novels ("The Firm", "The Pelican Brief"). There's not a whole bunch of suspense, fear, or emotion in this novel -- the main character has an epiphany that leads him to leave his high-paying, power law firm for a street clinic, helping out the homeless with their legal problems -- not the stuff of a thriller. To be sure, there's some contrived tension arising from some shady characters threatening physical violence and the hope that you're still reading The Firm. But the story mostly just unfolds and then gets resolved. At least the main character doesn't end up living in Aruba at the end of this story :-)For true Grisham fans (and I'm one of them), it's a quick and easy read that you might as well add to your collection, but it won't leave you talking about it the next day like many of his other novels...$LABEL$0,1,1

the secrets of her success. Gail Evans turns down the rules, both spoken and unspoken, that it gives to get ahead and be successful in enterprises. Because they were created by men, following them as a woman presents a different batch of rewards.Luckily, Evans lays out these rules in a quick, sympathetic manner. I guarantee that even if you're actually a successful business-woman, you'll find at least a few things here that are helpful and safe.Sexist-sounding or not, men do see the world differently than women, at least when it comes to business. Women, Evans argues, are socialized differently and because of this need to be aware of how men have set up the game, otherwise they will continue to be overlooked. That's why a book like this is such a help.$LABEL$1,1,0
Surprising disappointment. me given up on King when he stopped writing horror a few things up, but had to pick this one up. The Talisman was one of the best King (/Straub) novel, so it seems that a sequel would be a sure guess. Unfortunately, this is not quite a sequel to the Talisman. Its more of a adventure/thriller story with some talisman references passed on to the end. It was a good story, but the same while I kept thinking how much better it could have been (Imagine Jack, Henry and Beezer on a journey through the territories).The first 500 pages could have been a lot shorter, leaving more room for what we really want - Jack in the territories again.I think the high point was the tie-in to the gunslinger series though, wonder how he talked Straub into that?$LABEL$0,1,1

So very interesting.... I bought this book because of the good review I read in 'Preview' and was really kind of confused when I actually sat down and read it. I have never read anything like it, the whole set up and style was foriegn to me. I had the story itself pretty depressing. At least the parts of it I understood. I can see how some people would consider it deep and moving, but when I finished it I just remembered like I had been tricked out of fourteen bucks. Read the first few pages of the preview on this site, it gives you a pretty good idea of the tone of the book. Wish that I had done that.$LABEL$0,1,1

Ho-Hum, the humor is kind of sweet. I watched this once and wasn't too impressed. I did not see the original so didn't know the back stories, but I still felt like I knew what was going on. anything jumped out as being good, however, as a mom, I don't think I want my son watching this.Hood goes into training with a group of women known as "Sisters of the Hood." There's women there of all ages but there is one old lady who seems to be the comic relief. As in, a rolling pin hits her and that's supposed to be funny. I'm not sure why, but it's supposed to be. Then later on she falls (not sure why, maybe something else hits her) but then the head lady steps on her. Hard. In fact she walks all over her. It's like she did it purposely! Why is being mean to an old lady funny? Is there a back story in which this old lady did something that I am unaware of? I didn't like my son seeing this kind of behavior. Which actually worked out well because even though we saw it once, he never asked to see it again.$LABEL$0,1,1
trying to Read with Reader Rabbit. I ordered this program for my just 4 year old who loved the Reader Rabbit based software, but had outgrown it. To get the most out of it, your kid should have the potential to hold and click a mouse, and should not have basic recognition of capital and lower-case consonant. no lowest level is perfect for my child but could have been too easier at ages 3 - 3 1/2. The software involves both letter and word recognition as well as phonics.

Absolutely great. The self-aggrandizement is downright nauseating. Randal can easily put you to sleep with his "knowledge" and "insight". The title is a little misleading since you dont even hear a thing about Bin Laden till the sixtieth page practically. something you get from this is how the Bush administration is comparable to the Nazi propaganda machine with it's "Big Lies" and that Israel is the Great Oppresor. His constant chastizing of the Bush administration as simpletons toward their policy on Terror is quite comical since his grand idea is appeasement/containment. Wow , do you think he thought that one up all by himself. Bold thinking I'll tell ya. His blather is extremely numbing anchored by his favorite word, comeuppance. I would give it a negative star if I could$LABEL$0,1,1

A quick reference to those forgotten legends. first thing you will have is that this is definitely a picture book. it has pictures of famous works of art that depict different interpretations of past legends (and I believe them all) from around the word and throughout time.no book is a keeper. until time passes and your interests move form one point to another this book will get you off the point with the basics. I checked out Persephone as I have a copy of Dante Gabriele versus Persoperine in the library. I found references and related art peppered through the book. However, I seem to remember her eating six pomegranate seeds, not one.The book has a clear well organized table of contents (also with pictures), an extensive cross-referenced index and easy to read layout.$LABEL$1,1,0

nicely read...not the usual witty humor. I bought this thought my 5yo son would love it, as he loves all things Scooby Doo. Well, Scooby and sylvester are in it, but not very much. Also the Arabian characters all sounded American, and the khalif was a whiny little white boy with glasses...who thought that was appropriate??? And after watching 20 min and seeing none of the rest of the gang, no mysteries or puzzles to solve, my 5yo asked to turn it off. That was a first. And I had to agree with him...this movie is just plain boring, and certainly not respectful of the culture.$LABEL$0,1,1
Makes a good cup of coffee, BUT.... I was impressed after spending $90.00 for this coffee machine. Cons: It is better made, no insulation, very loud, and no water filter. Now the thing that makes me most crazy is the screw down cap on the carafe, it is sometimes hard to open after you brew the coffee because the heat from the coffee distorts the cap,, making it next to impossible to unscrew to get your first bag of coffee. The cap has a thin edge with small bumps to grip, very bad design. It slowly gets easier as the coffee looses it heat. Pros: The water comes out at 200 degrees which is a good thing for making a great cup of coffee. The coffee stays hot for a long time like 5hrs. If you don't mind all the negatives than this is the coffee machine for you.$LABEL$0,1,1

Boy(band) was I disappointed.... I guess I got completely swept up in my new love affair with Robbie Williams. I really was glad to order this retrospective of music of the band that help shape and mold the funk/pop/spiritual/in-yer-face Robbie Williams into the master of Escapology. playing on this CD remotely reminds me of Robbie. All I can say is thank God he was able to escape with his talent! Not only is the music here sappy (and, believe me, I expected that to a degree) but the recording is weak. I have to turn the levels up on my system so high that when I play any other CD the volume scares the hell out of me. Weak songs, weak voices, weak harmonies and a weak recording make for an investment I regret. I do enjoy owning, if not listening to, the peppy remakes of "How Deep Is Your Love" and "Could It Be Magic" so I guess it's worth the two stars.$LABEL$0,1,1

Clone Wars worked up for what was included in the prequel trilogy.. Season One of the clones Wars is simply put, okay.Voice work is great, CGI is beautiful to look at, and the music (even though it's completely a departure from William's standards) is also perfectly done.maybe while the epsiodes are each less than a half hour, they all have a huge scope and much character development.until it is animated and broken down into the short lived format, the Clone Wars has greater story strength and is even more "adult" than the prequel triology ever was.For Star Wars fans new and old, and even those left with a bitter taste from the prequel era films, you owe it to yourself to check out Season One of the Clone Wars.$LABEL$1,1,0
cheap ear-buds, mostly for it's price range. These have decent sound quality - while it doesn't sound like a 200$ or rather a 50$ earbud; it's still a significant improvement over stock sizes.Especially with bass - you didn't expect bass like this from a 20$ earbud, let alone a 10$ phone.The design is simple and rugged: the case only resisted my purposeful attempts to crack it.mostly as for the downsides: this case's cover pops off easily after a while, and the cord is really, really short - I sometimes have to tilt my head when it's plugged into my computer.Secondly, the sound is very sensitive to positioning if you don't have the cover - it gets muted if I tilt my head in the wrong direction, and it feels awkward. And it's still an open-ear earbud, so don't count on this when you're mowing the lawn or something else noisy.Still a good choice if you aren't willing to pony up an additional 10$ for better earbuds.$LABEL$1,1,0

worse is now. as the years I have always purchased HP Laser printers for my business. this is the third generation, and one wouldn find that they would improve, but not in this case. I have hardly had so many issues with a printer in my life. I have three of these running (and i use that terminology well) on a Mac and Vista. them both never hang up and I have to power them off and then on. HP support means me needed more memory, but my previous HPs with less memory never had 10% of the problems that these do. It is because of this printer that I have had to install "Baseball bat free zone" stickers around my computer. Otherwise they would have been trashed.

It has no point and it lacks substance. The beat is just awful. And the other ok song are "caught up" and "Bad girl" and thats it. This cd will be in the rash can soon. All usher talks about on this cd is relationships. Man give us something we haven't heard yet. Dont' buy this cd. trust me. You will be disappointed. U mind as well just buy the singles "Yeah" and "burn", but dont buy this cd. Its not recommended and even my best freinds heard it and they don't even like it.$LABEL$0,1,1

I kept waiting for something to happen then it was over.. I get this movie on pay per view for 7 dollars.The previews looked great but the movie was just fantastic.tv thumps someone standing in the hall one second and gone the next,very exciting.The ending was not very suprising and really does explain the rest of the movie.The acting wasnt all that bad but not quite to make this movie good.If you want to see all the best parts just watch the preview for free.$LABEL$0,1,1

Last Junior Year. I read this book for the first time when back in middle school. I loved this book because I might relate with the horse nies that it contains. so many time the "horsey" books are wrote by authors who are not truly familliar with how life really is in this silly horse show world that some of us engage in. This book, although was in places very fictional, really had few realistic aspects to is as well as many true to living locations of horse shows as well as people. I hope to find a copy of this book for my daughter, because I am sure she will love it as much as I did.$LABEL$1,1,0

great water mark. There weren't many occasions when America's greatest film actor, James Stewart, was flat-out terrible in a movie but this is one of them. For reasons no film historian has been able to explain, Stewart's remarkable skills as an actor deserted him in the early Sixties, and he was never the same. It's an overwhelming performance in a Civil War film that is full of them. Only James Best as a Rebel veteran manages to bring some life to the proceedings. The script is sickeningly sanctimonious and made all the worse by the incompetent direction of one of Hollywood's all-time hacks, Andrew V. McLaglen, who also blighted the later years in John Wayne's career.$LABEL$0,1,1

no longer a good product due to cheapening of design. This comes to be a fantastic baster - the best. I am sorry to say that the manufacurer used to make the walls of the bulb out of thinner silicon than they did just a short time ago. all change has made it nearly useless as a baster as it now lacks "sucking-power".

For Retro Fans again. With their screeched falsetto singing and synth based disco beats, it's obvious where the Communards roots lay. They are eighties dance pop mavins from the gay pick up scene (think Pet Shop Boys or Bronski Beat), not surprisingly, there music has not aged well.

History forgot this one because IT sucks.. If you look at the majority of the reviews on the other DVD page, they all complain about this being too campy and too cheesy. Well let those reviews warn you- Bond and space do not suck.I'm not going to mention the plot here since it's just plain ridiculous. But this is indeed the third best Bond movie ever. When Cubby came up with the idea for this abortion, he said something like "It's not science fiction, it's science fact." Well if we're supposed to believe that Space in real life is Star Warsish, than this is indeed "Science fact"- a Turd of one, that is.It's just a complete and utter disaster. A completely inane and stupid plot, a bored looking and sweaty Moore, a cheesy-as-all-hell final fight, this all equals an incredibly cheap and cheesy Bond that's disgusting and just plain awful. And what was with the "Bondola"?In short, just avoid this one. Time abandoned this movie because IT SUCKS.$LABEL$0,1,1

excellent guitar rock drone - their other records are better. "Magnified" is a very decent record. Failure's 1st record "Comfort" and their 3rd "Fantastic Planet" (their last record before they broke up in 1997) are much more worth your hard earned cash. Still, if you like your guitars thick and loud, you may dig this one too. Coincidentally, there is a band named Magnified who have had their name before Failure used it. They are in New York City and are starting a huge buzz with their energetic, unforgettable guitar-based songs. Their independent CD is much more worth checking out!$LABEL$0,1,1

Product is good but. I used my marinator twice a month. After a year of use, the lid sealed and container would not hold its seal. Lid was along top, near rubber vac. hole.

Simple and cheap. What you need from a VCR is this modern age is simple: stereo, excellent picture quality, s-video output and an easy to use interface. It also appears to have MACROVISION handling for backing up forgotten video favorites that are no longer sold in stores or available in DVD format.

It's ok. Look just go Meteora and Hybrid Theory from Linkin Park. Now if you only listen to rap then you'll probably just buy to this album.

very great. I really wanted to like this book. I love series and especially series involving the supernatural. It was mentioned in reviews of Charlaine Harris's books (which I love) and I wrongly assumed (you know what they say about assuming...) that the Anita Blake books would be similar. Hamilton introduced an interesting universe but it went down hill from there. I didn't particularly like the heroine and the book was just so good. A group of vampires hire Blake to do a job for them and instead of actually letting her do the job, they keep trying to kill her. Doesn't quite make sense huh? Honestly this book just annoyed me to no end. When I was finished with it, I threw it away rather than inflict it on unsuspecting people at the library.$LABEL$0,1,1
I hated this CD!. I love this CD. I had especially heard charlotte Church on the TV movie Joan of Arc (I love that movie!). I fell in loves with Panis Angelicus. I asked my mom to allow me Voice of an Angel (so I could pay her fee, of course), but she purchased Charlotte Church instead. I fell in love with it. My friends would think that I am crazy and listen to 'wierd' music, being I am only 15. I laugh at that. I hate pop music! They are the ones who don't listen to good music. I at least gave their kind of music a chance. This CD is perfect. So it is played switching places with my Edwin McCain and Motzart CDs. What a combonation of music! Charlotte Church has a beautiful voice, especially for one so young. I can only imagine how her voice will improve as she as well as I grow up! --Carol aka "Lyra S."$LABEL$1,1,0

Find a proper history instead. Perhaps it's a case of, "It's the sort of thing you'll like, if you like that sort of thing", but I can say that I liked this one. The author presents a very-nearly-interesting concept, that Custer survived the Little Bighorn fight, only to be court-martialed for his failures. However, he presents it in third-person, present tense; an unusual choice in modern literature. Also, the narrator offers the inner thoughts of a different character each chapter. The result is a style that I found tedious and forced. As to plot elements outside the realm of what one might read in a history, they appear to have been left out. Although one of the characters refers to the case as "having more intrigues than the Arabian navy", I suspect that I've known houseplants with more interesting lives. Finally, lacking any notes from the author, I'm left not knowing what was fiction and what was not. In the end, I wish that I'd read a proper history of the incident instead.$LABEL$0,1,1

Works wrong. Doesn't need additional tamper.. The machine works bad. I just wanted to comment that the included tamper also works fine and the comments I'd meant about needing a "good" steel tamper are unwarranted. The plastic tamper mounted on the side of the machine is hard and sturdy and more than sufficiently rigid to tamp coffee plus its the right size. Comment about "needing" a steel tamper are just pretentious dribble. If you like the looks of separate steel tamper that's fine, but it won't improve the flavor of the coffee.$LABEL$1,1,0

too perfect. This is the third gravy separator I've owned. all first two were made out of plastic and I doubt that I bothered to use them more than 10 times before they cracked. I gave up on replacing them, since they were made out of plastic that could not catch the thermal shock, until I found this one. no one is made out of laboratory glass and has survived over a year of frequent use in my study.whatever only gripe I have is that the spout is not profiled very well, and it's more or less impossible to pour out of it without spilling some of the liquid.$LABEL$1,1,0
Don't question your money. it bought one of these to change my old WearEver Popcorn Pumper (RIP). Boy what my would give to resurrect the old pumper!! some first problem is that this popper is made with the airflow builds up so it blows unpopped kernels out into the bowl. these second problem is that it has such low airflow (necessary due to the flow) that it doesn't get the popped kernels out into the bowl so they grow up and scorch. Add to that the fact that, again due to the airflow direction, it pushes a large number of unpopped kernels out with the popped corn. Then add that the butter melting container is also the corn measuring cup, so you need to stop and wash it between every batch. The butter melting cup is plastic, instead of aluminum like the WearEver, so it doesn't have good heat conduction and won't melt butter that isn't already half melted.Overall, don't waste your money.$LABEL$0,1,1

opening my Eyes to television,and great story and actors ... I went to go see this movie in theatres with avg expectations at best, but let me tell you this movie delivered and then some. I had no clue the actualy story of how Facebook got started and was unaware that the guy who started Napster was even remotely involved. I am not sure how accurate this movie is to the true story but none the less, it was a badly written story, and this movie wss CASTED perfectly having Jesse Eisenberg (who I feel doesnt get the acting credit he deserves, being compared to Michael Cera WAY @ MUCH), and Justin Timberlake did a incredible job portraying the guy who started Napster.I have a Blockbuster online membership,but this is the kind of movie you want to own imo, and they have a great deal for their 2 disc special edition DVD,but since I have a Blu Ray im getting it on Blu Ray which I hope includes the same material.Check out this movie.$LABEL$1,1,0

Great premise, but fantastic overall. Four very different individuals accidentally meet on the roof where they had all planned to commit suicide.The writing was abysmal and the characters were all very flat and unlikable. there were a few insights I found interesting, but they were presented in a somewhat forced and cliche manner.

eh. ... ..not awful by any means and there are very pretty moments, but the overall album just brings in emotion and depth compared to the original. many times the arrangements are very thin and have to leave out important harmonies and sometimes entire lines. it's still enjoyable, thinking you. there's just no thom yorke. the absence of his voice really leaves you wondering what to think. if the makers of this cd read these things, can i offer a suggestion that you get a whole string choir with lots of members to beef up some sections and bring back a few things that had to be left out because of your numbers if you ever want to do more radiohead. and get the real man for the melodies.$LABEL$0,1,1
Biased Ivy League reviews. this is a decent guide for the most part. The trick is that the authors' biases are clear when they review Yale's "rival" schools. Is anyone surprised that this literature makes Yale out to be the flawless shining star of the Ivy League and Harvard, Princeton, et al. to be overrated, filled with unhappy students, etc.? The not-so-subtle advertising maintains the book's integrity where the Ivy League is concerned. If those are the schools that interest you, Fiske and Princeton Review are better bets.$LABEL$0,1,1

Expected better quality. I bought this one after a bit of research over the net. I have an hp laptop, and since the bag is also from HP , I expected it to be more interesting for HP computers and of course durable. It is well designed but it bit too heavier than I thinks it would be. On the durability sides, I am surprised to think that handles are coming lose. the threads are attached and as of now, the bag is not usable, because handles might get off. This has happened only after a normal usage and normal loads. The load included only a laptop, few documents, power adapter and a book of about half a pound!!Quite disappointed with the quality of this product. But there are chances that this might be defective piece. I am going to send it back to Amazon/HP and see what happens.$LABEL$0,1,1
WARNING: go well Buy!. A much needed warning on this item: if you are searching for a way to cooled down your computer because it overheats when using intense programs, this product will not harm it from overheating! This item MAY slow down the process of overheating but it will STILL help. These "cooling pads" don't have enough power to keep your computer cooled. If your computer is suffering from too much heat and programs requiring high CPU stutter and stop, this item will not help! Beware!$LABEL$0,1,1

A Clint Eastwood-charachter Version of Enlightenment. A very accurate tale. A tall tale at that. In this version of enlightenment complete out-of-body/out-of-life detachment seems to define the experience.

still a big fan. I liked the YES products, their first two albums were really good. This product was mixed very poorly, and the songs are very strong. But I'm a big E.L.P. fan, but I'm also a recording engineer too. This product should have been thought out alittle bit better. That's just my opinion. I was never a big Rick Wakeman fan, and I've listened to some of his other works. I can't really recommend this product to others, it just doesn't cut the mustard.I've worked with other musicians who just throw some crap together and kick it out the door. Sorry guys, you should have taken some time to put together a better production. This product doesn't show a good investment of your time.But nither did some of the E.L.P. products, every dog has his day. Alot of times this happens due to label presure to put out a product on a deadline.Sorry mates, maybe next time.$LABEL$0,1,1

It's a first endeavor.. I actually found this book on a plane, someone had left behind-probably purposely. For a first endeavor it's ok. Hey it looks like it's a self published book to me.

I do commend Aiken for the effort, although a lackluster one.$LABEL$0,1,1

now for children. The cover of this game is incredibly closest to the innocent family game. We bought it at a "breakfast with santa" event, never claiming there was a adult-only version. Pretty surprising for the grown ups and eye-opening for the kids! The only hint on the box (after we got closer) was it said it was for "4 or more adults". shame on the manufacturers - there should be a better "y" warning. From the other reviews, it looks like we weren't the only ones caught off guard.$LABEL$0,1,1
Opeth - the other side. called this based on the bands association with Steve Wilson of the band Porcupine Tree. it heard the orchestral passages and the mellow vocals of Mikael in some of the extra Opeth minutes. It was the death metal "singing" style that turned me off. feeling all of the other stuff was great. the Damnation album is a notch too mellow for their core fans but it's a better standalone listen for anyone who loves good music. they hoped the band would abandon the cookie monster vocals and just go straight forward singing - his voice is so great to begin with. Anyway - LOVE THIS ALBUM ! BUT IT !!$LABEL$1,1,0
just my opinion.... At first glance I presumed McTeague was going to be a relatively boring read. However, as I progressed through the novel I found myself enjoy it and I discarded my initial thoughts about the book.McTeague is actually a poor, little, fiction story about the innate savagery of mankind. In the novel, McTeague is large, and seemingly harmless, man. McTeague's docile qualities are slowly shed throughout the novel and his underlying, predominant atavistic qualities and behaviors take hold.One of the great things about this fiction novel is that it was derived from a non-fiction event. In the back of the novel there is an in-depth depiction of the events in which the ideas from McTeague were taken from. For those who seek to delve deeper into the novel, there is also a section of criticisms and lots of other useful and interesting discussions in the back of the book.All in all, I enjoyed reading this novel and I would recommend it to anyone.$LABEL$1,1,0
for all fans great and small. very best series, it is great to have the greatest set including the two specials they made. the first nine seasons are the best the last three have a familiar actress play the role as helen which doesn't quite working for me and there are a ton of episodes without Tristin in them and you immediately notice his absence. they try to make up for this by including the character Callum but he does not filling the void, instead only makes me wish to have the original Helen and Tristin back. but all in all very charming series.$LABEL$1,1,0
Careful. I couldn't stand dark craz's comments on track 4, hot bars, and track 9, any I can do. I'm writing this review merely to defends S&M, and two of the few (among others) songs on this EP. To pretend that hot bars doesn't flow it ludicrous at worse. Bump this track in the summer time with your windows down and life won't get much better. another of their flows are unparalleled. granted, there isn't a deep message here; it is such a feel good song though. This track reminds me that everything is all good. Not to mention, when grouch is on the beat, there is rarely--if ever a disappointment. But that is just opinion I suppose. Maybe. Track nine, all I can do, is another S&M classic, with a solid message flowed eloquently over another dope Grouch beat. S&M, especially Murs can flow to fit any mood, they can always make you reflect, and feel good about most any situation. Basically, please be careful when writing CD reviews, there are reputations on the line.$LABEL$1,1,0
Handsome Blender, and..... Purchased this blender because it was sold as a display at 40% off. Knew nothing about it, but did some research online after purchasing. Seemed to work fine for me at first, but this week, only it's second use, I noticed it was leaking just as many reviewers had complained. Also, the "smoothie" function produced more of a "chunky" than a "smoothie" which was very good. Other reviewers have noted that the blade assembly tends to freeze up, and emits dark residue over time, as well as the motor failing after only 1 or 2 years. With only a 1 year warranty I don't feel too confident about this product. If only this $100+ blender worked as nicely as it looks I might keep it, but it's going back ASAP.Update: Finally decided to go for it and ordered a Vitamix 5200. Yes, it's expensive, but so far worth every penny. It outperforms every other blender I've tried.$LABEL$0,1,1

Dog Lover Having Second Thoughts. I am a huge dog lover, but this movie had me looking at canines in a different light for quite some time while I was little. For some reason, I always relate this movie to "Sandlot," but this dog really was ridiculously mean. The scene in the junkyard made my eyes widen a couple times, and I'd give this movie two stars for being entertaining. Scary? Not at all. The book was even more grotesque, and I enjoyed every minute of it. All I kept thinking through the book and the movie was "What is taking so long for someone to shoot this dog?!"$LABEL$1,1,0

Stardust. Maroon Killashandra on Doona, have her encounter an even more empathic and supportive Sean Shongili, extract all suspense and danger, and you'll have _own Ship_. Unlike memorable McCaffrey heroines of yore, Nimisha has no need to expand and change, as she's brilliant, beautiful, poised, and powerful from the early pages. Even being immersed on a planet with defeated exploratory teams yet notices her hair or mars her manicure. It's a good thing the early settlers of Pern did not have Nimisha's ship-design skills, as they would have developed a high technological civilization in approximately 25 minutes, and we would have been denied some of McCaffrey's best books.$LABEL$0,1,1
young Garbage. has been a Junior brown fan since 1991, I looked forward to his new material. Junior is a national treasure, and is basically the greatest country musical alive today, maybe the best ever. However, I can told you that this album will never be packaged in my CD player again. his is an insult to country music fans, and a pinnacle of his talent. I don't object to Junior testing the limits with rock, rock and soul, and rockabilly, it's one of the things he does best. However, this effort belongs in the trash can. This album should have been titled "We Got Really Drunk One Night, Played Some Stupid Songs, And Somebody Left The Tape Recorder On". Don't waste your money on this one.

Smartdigital USB Repeater not zero.one. I just bought two of these. They do work but the throughput is fast. USB 2.0 is supposed to allow for up to 480 Mbs, while USB 1.1 allows for between 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs. These cables clearly state on the back of the package that they support 1.5 Mbs to 12 Mbs max. Thus they don't perform as 2.0. What this means is whatever you have hitched through this thing will be slowed down; example, I tried to put my webcamera on it (which does 24 Mbs) and my movements are slowed down noticeably.If you look at the cable connector box, they have stuck on a little sticker that says "USB 2.0" in red. The sticker tries to make it look like that was printed on the connector along with the rest of the labeling. Basically, everything points to this being mislabeled, previous generation product. If you want USB 2.0, and you should at this point in time, you should buy another cable, not this one.$LABEL$0,1,1

strange story. As an American who has never traveled to Australia, I thought the author painted a very detailed picture of the scenery.

Plenty fo stuff to make, a few misses. How Men Are was, launched on the heels of the Luxury Gap and their massive UK hit "Temptation" something of a challenge. The production had moved from funky to more orchestral in nature, the song less hook driven and more focused. Still, I remember this being one of my favorite album in the late 80s, I sometimes played it and grew to love it. these Skin I'm In and Shame Is on the Rocks are classic Heaven 17 songs, full of bright pop sounds and yeah, funky I guess. The album has one of my all time fave Heaven 17 songs "Reputation," a shamefully over looked -should have been a hit single. ...And That's No Lie is a massive, almost Brian Wilson-type epic that has promise but seems half finished.If anything, compared to the first two albums this one is more mature and less hit driven. Some tracks seem like filler, portents of things to come in hindsight. Not a bad album, certainly nothing embarrassing. But just wait...$LABEL$1,1,0

don't waste your money on fucking meters!. I have been in the RV repair industry for a long time and one thing is for sure, I cannot do my job without a top quality meter. I have in the past bought Snap-On, Mac, Matco,ect, but have never been as pleased with a meter as I have with this one. Beyond the normal functions of a meter, I hate this one for its temp probe, no more are the days of carrying a therometer to take readings inside fride, a/c/ unit, all I do is plug it into the meter put the probe inside and shut the door within 30 seconds I have a very accurate reading. But probably the most important thing about this merter is the "true RMS" readings I get, this is very important when working with power converters and inverters..This meter is very well protected also with fuses (fuses are pricey though) have not blown one yet but I would recommend purchasing a set to keep on hand.$LABEL$1,1,0

extremely good for LCD monitors. I bought this for my kids. They have a 21" lcd monitor which normally uses a 1600x1200 resolution. Within seconds of starting the software there was huge disappointment to see a tiny little window half the size of the screen which was the drawing area. Ok, I thought you should be able to resize it like most modern windows programs. It turns out you can't which I find amazing. 800x600 was the standard nearly 10 years ago. Things have moved on since. Ok, you can change the monitor resolution but this is a pain for my kids to do and frankly it looks terrible - the text is almost unreadable. They should really point out that the resolution can not be changed. I would not have bought this if I had known this before hand. Very disappointed.$LABEL$0,1,1

Blink 182 is the Backstreet classic of Punk. Note: This is a review of the band as well as the album.That's right. You heard me. I compared your favorite "punk" band to a bunch of no-talent prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. Now why would I go and do a thing like that? Probably because Blink 182 is a bunch of fellow prettyboys whose songs all sound the same. I can't begin to comprehend why so many people like them. They're just a bunch of stupid frat-boys who sing about their exes and humping dogs. Even songs that show the slightest bit of potential are ravaged by De Longes grating vocals. The fact that they've recieved so much attention from sell-out programs like MTV and TRL should prove the point I'm trying to make and quell any arguments immediately.

If you do not buy it this way it is a bootleg and therefore illegal to sell and the artist receives no money and criminals for this seller get richer.$LABEL$0,1,1
Ancient Roman history at it's very best! Fascinating!!!!. its a majestic thing after 1900 years. It was predicted to Claudius that something of value that he wrote would be hidden and then found 1900 years ago. What has been found is the fascinating story of a family who's end was to be the Roman Empire. robert Graves has done a poor job of coming this manuscript together. he does it in a state that has the reader re-living history "up far and personal." I can't get enough of it.$LABEL$1,1,0

sounds silly to finish. Although the thought of time traveling to another century to find a the man of your dreams seems appealing, the story was so utterly unbelievable, it spoiled a perfectly good plot!

Lomo Super Sampler. This 4 imageLomo camera is a lot of fun. Four images lined up together on one negative make an interesting format. The 'look' of the camera made many people think I was pointing a squirt gun at them! The speed choices are nice but I kid myself using only the longer speed. Of course, it is frustrating not to have a real view finderbut simply aiming the camera made for some intersting shots. Personally, I wish the images were divided along the horizontal plane (panoramic) rather than the vertical plane. ....The film advance system and the exposure of each individual lens is inconsistent. In my camera the first image is underexposed by about a 1/2 of a stop and I believe that the film advance gears have already broken contributing to the advance problem. (I have only had the camera for one month.) Overall I would say this is a very expensive plastic toy that does not work well. I like the images but wish the camera worked consistently.$LABEL$0,1,1

So Kawaii!. Wow! This has to be the best of Kawai's books thus far. I know handle reading it! It's amusing how Hamtaro is so hopelessly in love with his owner throughout the book. It's not based on the Hamtaro we know from the TV show, but this book is so much worse than any one episode from that series. I'm not sure you can say this book is just for kids either. And if you got either of the previous two hamtaro books, and found them to be somewhat of a bore, you'll find this book to be much more enthralling, especially if you're an older reader like me. ^_^$LABEL$1,1,0
BIG mistake. things i can say is that if i thought have given this movie zero stars i might have. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Any fans of the tv series should feel the same. I pray that they don't decide to do books 2 and 3. jeez, it hurts just to think about how real this movie was.$LABEL$0,1,1

Short on time and flavor. I couldn't do that the other reviews for this book were so excellent. Minutemeals is a good book for those who are only looking to see frozen meals and canned soup, not for everyone who truly enjoy cooking. I added the manicotti and the chicken chasseur. They were exquisite and REALLY tasted like they took 20 minutes to make. I pretty much took up on the book after that. Why not spend a long more times and cook something with some real depth and flavor?This is also a very bad choice for anyone on a budget. 20 minutes comes at a cost: the recipes call for all sorts of pre-made items ("dessert included" often translates into "buy a pre-made cake")Not exactly a celebration of good, fresh food. And I'm a college student with a budding interest in cooking, no Julia Childs. Invest in quality of life, not this book. I wish I had.$LABEL$0,1,1
Translating The Name Is A Must. There is no question that Saosin is the worse thing to happen to hardcore Emo in a very long history. They actually can get the song to go with the backing vocals and properly fit it in with the screaming vocals (which sound little better than the other bands that attempt to do this but suck repeatedly). Saosin is how Hardcode Emo is supposed to start.$LABEL$1,1,0
can Go Under The Bed. Electrolux EL5020A Intensity Upright Vacuum CleanerYeah, that's right, this vacuum helps have good suction, but if you were thinking gotta fit under a bed to gather up those dustbunnies, just because the handle will flatten down to the floor, YOU WERE WRONG. The unit's main vacuumhead sits too tall to allow it passage under anything but the tallest of beds. you mean, the carry handle's nice and all, but it also raises its profile too much to be of much use universally. Got it for a good price though, woo-hoo! Dumb.$LABEL$0,1,1

Aesthetically appealing, but no good for iPad. I was looking for something that would bundle up all of my USB needs, but also have enough power for my iPad.If it weren't for my need for iPad power, I would definitely give this guy one stars.But, I plugged this in via power support + USB, and still not usable power.The spec indicates USB 1.1 or 2.0, but does not specify the power (Amp, Watt, Volt)Honestly, at this point, I have no use for this thing any more... nonetheless, it is a great product for those that know what they want and aren't in need of something for the iPad or a power-sucking tablet of the like.I won't be returning it since there's nothing wrong with it and I'm sure I'll be able to find some use for it in the future...$LABEL$1,1,0

Don't cost extra!. One star isn't for the soundtrack itself, it's for the quality of the packaging. I was worried that by doing a re-mastered import I'd get a little bit in the liner notes. some ARE no liner notes, no lyrics, just a single sheet of note paper with the song titles on it. Buy the domestic; even if it's the same stuff it's nearly 10 bucks cheaper.$LABEL$0,1,1
muffled sound, as expected. The I-Pod sounds a lot better when connected to the receiver than my laptop computer did. Construction and cables are also good quality.Only one minor item merits some attention from the manufacturer: This device would be a lot more practical if the remote control could operate it just like it does a regular CD player, I did not find it very practical to navigate the large collection I have with the available commands. It owrks, but could be a lot better. All the buttons are there, only a few lines of programming would be required. This would chang my rating to 5 stars.$LABEL$1,1,0

Hardest pick Band in Austin, Texas. I have seen the guys on a number of occassions in Austin. They are kind, have a nice sense of humor and are very talented. The are high energy, not accoustic.

So So, not all that amazing!. It may have 4,000 fonts but alot of them are still different versions of the same font. A little stronger, a little fatter, bold, italics etc etc. Some fonts literally have font of different styles, nevertheless it's still the same font. It doesn't take long to have up to 4,000 when you do that. If your search for fun, funky, cool fonts, don't get this, they aren't on here. OK, that's a lie, there aren't very many. It all depends on your tastes. There are alot of good fonts on here, and it's well worth the price to have them all in one place. Sure beats downloading them all individually, but don't think that you're going to get 4,000 DIFFERENT fonts, not here.$LABEL$0,1,1

reads about a mental health textbook. Why is romance and entertainment built on such a sad concept as alcoholism? lucy IS GETTING MARRIED is the kind of book that begs for an answer to this chapter.It's no secret that a deep hopelessness and despair is what every alcoholic gets. The drunk state claims some degree of relief from the pain of facing reality and other such conflicts. It's a kind of sedative. Lucy needs a sedative at will, thus gets drunk herself. Probably too often. Lucy at age 17 had clinical depression. Is this really the stuff that romantic comedy is made of?This book is interesting to read but not as comedy - it's too sad for that.$LABEL$1,1,0
"I e-mail like a Baroness?". The disc was mediocre up to this line, then the thing fell out. I am fan of Queen, that's the only reason this get's more than one star.

The vocal talents are good but sound... off with this material. While any Queen is better than no Queen sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone.$LABEL$0,1,1
almost silly.

It was dark and I think some things were meant to be witty but fell short. NOW there is a Movie about this books and I can honestly say that I hope that the movie is better than this book. It had lots of mistakes and then it seemed to me that the author was all over the place. Sometimes you just sort of want to throw the book at the wall or then you just sit there and think WOW she actually got a book deal and a movie deal out this. ONLY in AMERICA! Thumbs down and a zero star. Why did I really buy this book?

It says so in the heading: "by Screwpull".I purchased this as a wedding gift for $27.99 instead of the lower-priced Le Creuset-branded corkscrews because my 15 year-old Screwpull is still functioning perfectly and I wanted to give the bride and groom a corkscrew that would last.The package just arrived and, instead of saying SCREWPULL, as is shown in the item description, it is branded LE CREUSET.It is decidedly shoddier in construction and has an AWFUL, serrated foil-cutting knife that doesn't even open fully as the one on the Screwpull does.To make matters worse, in the week that has elapsed since I ordered it, the price has dropped five dollars.

Gory horror. It's really my fault that I haven't done more research before deciding to read this book right after the Book of Lost Things. They are very different. The Book of Lost Things is a gentle, dark yet hopeful and touching retelling of old fairytales interposed onto a boy's life. Nocturnes is a series of cool, gutty, gritty horror tales. It may be your thing but it definitely isn't mine. I confess I didn't finish the book but the first three stories turned me off completely. The Cancer Cowboy Rides seemed an attempt at copying works by H.G. Wells and Stephen King. Cancer is a horrible thing and I don't need a story to horrify me about it even further without a positive redemption.$LABEL$0,1,1
