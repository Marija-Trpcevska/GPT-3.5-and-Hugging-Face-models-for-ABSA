This Is Not crap Or Even Rock. Hearing that led Zeppelin was a heavy metal product,(and I am a huge metal fan), who forgot to buy this album since I had heard it was less good.Well it stinks.Not anywhere on this great album is not even the iest hint of metal. Actually The Beatles feel heavier than this. Dy'er Maker is so un-heavy it should be classed with Frank Sinatra. Only if you are a pop fan should you buy this album, so metalheads and headbangers, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$0,1,1
A Meditation for Living Right Daily. I used this book while hoping for some history in thekind of meditation literature for recovering alcoholics. Peoplewho have proved that their lives have changed miraculouslyby the practice of principles and living on spiritual basis.this little book is impressive. Just a few lines of encouragementeach day. Spirituality is indeed a feeding of the mind on thewholeness and beauty that comes from God. Many basic principleslearned here add peace to my life. The combination of scriptureswith little commentary is especially good for those of us lookingto feed ourselves spiritually in a short time - on the run.Sometimes you can find a real gem. This book is so simply butedifying and uplifting. To meditate on my heavly Father (fromwhom all blessings flow). Use it. I'm thankful I found it.My husband didn't read much scripture -- but he does read thislittle book.!! Thanks to the Author!!Linda$LABEL$1,1,0

strange Connection. Having just finished "The Corrections" and "Strong Motion", I listened to Jonathan Franzen's interview on NPR and notched up the volume when he was asked to cite his favorite works of fiction. With utmost trust in his recommendations, I then immediately acquired both of them -Fox's "Desparate Characters" and Christina Stead's "The Man Who Loved Children." "Desparate Characters" is indeed an artfully crafted, badly written novella, and would make an equally artful film or stage play if Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey agreed to work together again as Sophie and Otto. Franzen's worshipful preface, however, embarrassed me for him. Perhaps that's just his way. Ms. Fox's influence on his writing is evident throughout his work and I thank him for helping me discover her voice. My teenage son discovered her voice several years ago, when he read "The Slave Dancer", so readers with adolescent children might want to point them in her direction.$LABEL$1,1,0
The book is not the best!. It is not the best book I have read. It was really cool and freaky. The thing about it was that I didn't comprehend it much. It was usually a book that doesn't suit me that much. I didn't understand it much. At times, I felt stupid reading it because I didn't understand it. If you are a person who likes reading books about fire, this book is for you.I really don't want to have to read it again and I didn't like it. It was way out of my league. I didn't care for the Ray Bradbury. But, I am not saying I hate him. I am sayinh I might tru some of his other books as well as this book that I didn't like. Although this book does not fit my categories or my type of books, I would not recommend it to other people who like serious stuff.$LABEL$0,1,1
little Basic Overview, Not Current with Today's IP Technology. I expected the 2006 fourth edition to be more up to date with today's IP satellite technology. While the networking chapter discusses IP, it is in the contex of ATM and TDM technology with little or no information on current IP topologies and satellite Internet IP services like Hughes and BGAN among others. Additionally, there is no mention of current DVB-S or S2 technology which is widely deployed today. Roddy fails to make note of the broadcasting migration to IP with most of the broadcasting information somewhat dated.$LABEL$1,1,0
LIGHTS ! CAMERA ! INSIGHT !. I always dismissed Orwell as someone who wrote a beautiful book ("Animal Farm") and who otherwise "showed no leg".Wrong.The "Essays" sits like a seeming cinderblock on my nightstand, but gets nibbled at each and every night, at precisely the time when it would be so easy for me to simply go to sleep. Demonstrably, he writes not, for I do not go to sleep.Orwell is a master of the English language and of reasoned discourse. His politics are not MY politics, but who cares ? His well-written essays bid me forgive everything. Besides, there are more than a thousand pages of his "stuff" right here at my fingertips, so how could I possibly go to sleep?Thanks, George. If you wish to be paroled from the Hell to which all Socialists are sent, put me down as a reference.$LABEL$1,1,0
review: The Album. I have been a great fan of Wayne Hussey, and Craig Adams since the days when they ruled the goth world with Andrew Eldrich in The Sisters of Mercy. When they departed the S.O.M and formed The Mission, their first LP First Chapter was great. Gods Own Medicine which was the follow up album was a masterpiece in my judgement. The albums that followed "Children" & "Carved in Sand" were good. Then Simon Hinckler left the band and everything that followed was a disaster. The indie release The Mask was treacherous to listen to, and much to my sadness after listening to Resurrection, I can only think back to the days of past, when The Mission UK, ruled the world.$LABEL$0,1,1

Reliable mechanism, but not durable. I've gone through quite a supply of breakaway collars for my cats, so get had a chance to practically evaluate several major brands, this one works. This collar features a broad ovoid tab as the latching mechanism, and it's just hands above the snap latches on other collars. Unfortunately, the reflective material, which to me is as much a safety requirement at a reliable latch, quickly ages and the adhesive holding the reflective fabric fails, makes the nice and otherwise durable collar ineffective within a few months. When new, the reflective material was easily bright enough to spot a kitty in the dark at a 100 yards with a single bulb AA LED flashlight, so no problem being visible in car headlights. Without the same reflective material, the cat is invisible under the same conditions. The snug latch releases easily when torqued from the side as it would when caught on a passing object or brush. This would be a 5 star review if the product were durable.$LABEL$0,1,1

not disappointing. After years of using a 10/100 hub I decided to "upgrade" to a switch. was a good product from Linksys, especially since they were acquired by Cisco, I purchased the SD208 8-port 10/100 switch. I put it on my network and the problems stopped. Any time I would attempt to transfer large volumes (1GB+) of data between two of my PC's the switch would freeze up on me and I'd have to unplug it and plug it back in to regain network connectivity.I've put old reliable hub back in place and I'm returning the Linksys back to Amazon.

inexpensive, wireless, cheap graphics, fun for complete family.. As always, nintendo cannot not be doing the best package such as HD dvd or Blue ray, or monster HD graphics, but The 480P, wireless network, unique controlers, and low price tag guarantee this unit a very formitable competition for the X box 360 and pc. One thing nintendo has never left out is the incomplete family. This unit may not have all of the violent and quick selling games at the other two units, but it has plenty of games that are fun, and allowable for 5-8 year olds to play with. This is worth checking out. I'm sure you will not be dissappointed.$LABEL$1,1,0

Volume "blues" stopping this little guy from being a rock star.. the reviews on this device allude to the volume not being loud enough. After making it for a month, I agree whole honestly. I'm a rocker..what can I say..I like my music loud(not insanely loud) but quiet nevertheless. I have the much larger Zen and while I dig the little size of the 512TXFM, I completely miss the volume of the Zen. I know, I know, you can mess with the equalizer..done that already..still not the same..I know, I know, you can run your MP3's through an external gain software like MP3 gain..love that MP3 gain, but why should I have to add another step before uploading my tunes into the MuVo? So, what I have been doing is uploading my tunes and then during playback I find the ones that are really low in volume(most 70's stuff) and then go in take it out, MP3gain it, put it back in......bummer..Otherwise, this is a great little product and well worth the $$$$LABEL$1,1,0

The Bean Trees. Taylor Greer encounters many obstacles in her journey headed to town. She leaves her hometown looking to start a new, when a lady puts a child in the front seat of her Volkswagen and walks off. Taylor has no choice, but to take care of the child at least for a little while. But Taylor ends up loving the child more and more each day. Along her journey she meets many interesting people; Maggie- a woman that fixes cars for a living , Lou Ann- an overprotective mother and Mrs. Parsons- an old, blind woman that babysits small children. Taylor picks up a few jobs here and there, until she meets Lou Ann and moves in with her. Taylor's mission in this book is to find the child's relative's, but she never does. That's why I gave it two stars. I don't really like how the book ends, because it leaves you wondering.

Back to the past. Reading the reviews and listening to the album I get confused because itis, surprisingly, just a remake of her excellent album "Dry" of... 1993! It is that, along with U2's latest, she is getting back to her roots. If that is all she could extract musically and creatively from living in New York in the last year, then I would conclude that is a lot of hype for everyone.

Now an old style. I collect breakfast cookbooks (yep, there are TONS out there!) but Marion's book has become one of my personal faves: stained, dog-eared and plain. The Dried Fruit Cream Scones are excellent as are the Shirred Eggs, but her recipe for Pulled Bread (the easiest recipe in the world!) made me a fan for years. Many recipes have variations, and chapters consist of everything from breads to meat, as well as accompaniments including spreads and beverages and pies! Many of the recipes are ways to use up leftovers and hail from times past; don't look for new-fangled fusion cooking here, as Marion has strong opinions about not "startling" anyone that early in the morning.

Personal view. Music appreciation is a very personal view, and I can only express my own view, which others may disagree. The only thing is that I found Mr Watson's voices to be not that beautiful.

A little too depressing for a Self-Help book. my love Sark I know how she guest-stars Sabrina Ward-Harrison in her books, so I think now to reading a copy of Sabrina's book. First off: The artwork is gorgeous. Really. she collages are very personal and her effort pays off hansomly. On the other hand, the content of the book itself is hardly likely a big downer. There's no resolution to any of her issues, just a big complaint about how she feels she has no control about her esteem-lacking life. I'm sure that if I knew her I would be feeling much different. But there isn't the payoff that comes with seeing the other side of her personality. I do hope she keeps writing (she does have promise and her art is great), but her next piece has more "arc" to it from the internally repressed to the externally liberated.$LABEL$0,1,1

The songs are usually the radio (i.e. shortened) version of the original, or the Greatest Hits cd only includes the more widely accepted songs of the artist and exclude the gems that didn't get a lot of radio play. This Babyface Greatest Hits cd removes the original versions of the songs and even an extended live version of his song with Eric clapton.

Oh boy: what a boring life. This book could only possibly appeal to diehard ABBA fans who still want to know what made Annifrid, Benny, Bjorn and Agnetha tick. At the very least there should be some explanation for the costumes. But what Agnetha has dished is the finest revealing autobiography in living memory. She retraces events familiar to any self respecting fan and ignores questions of personality, musical preference...well, just about everything that makes one want to read someone else's story. I read the book in one sitting (very easy) and haven't touched it since, despite there being some excellent photos of her and the rest of the group. If you'd like something at least a little racy I'd recommend the (probably mostly fictional) biography "The Name Of The Game", but as for "As I Am" best get on with your (probably more interesting) life.$LABEL$0,1,1

Connelly churns out another lengthy novel. Connelly did it again with Lost Light. its work is everything you're looking for and then the story is unpredictable enough to keep you reading and turn the page. Like most characters in this genre of books, Bosch's life is written out as a chronology. unlike this novel he's now retired and he does reflect back, if briefly, on some of the previous cases we all read about. Its an appealing aspect to the Bosch series in that you find yourself relating to the character, almost as if you can imagine getting to know them. If you like Connelly, you'll probably find that this is one of his best works. You can see his continued growth as a writer and his works generally continue to get better and are more polished. Connelly shows again that he's one of the most gifted writers in this genre. All in all, another great read.$LABEL$1,1,0
awesome rock cd. I think this cd is terrible. I'm not a terribly big fan of hard rock but this cd is great to go to if you feel like rocking hard. that was, I really like the track Drive because it shows that Incubus can be softer too, as well as Pardon Me for it's lyrics and awesome chorus. I doubt one of the main reasons I like this cd is because it got me hooked on Incubus, now I can't wait to get my hands on their next cd. It's also good because Incubus is one of those bands that can really rock without using a lot of swear words.

If you want a medley of disaster movies, than this one is for you, others should stay away that it was the plague. The other reviewers all correct in their statements, any other Irwin Allen disaster movie or any other disaster movie should suffice. The highlight of the movie really is James Franciscus and his overblown dialogue. As I said, if you're in for a cheesy movie with tons of stars trying to earn a few bucks to pay off some taxes or blackmail, this might be the movie for you.....others....BEVARE!$LABEL$0,1,1

wow!. I don't really want to fill this out. lets waste your time reading right now, just accompanying thee to a theater to see this movie! Theron is awesome in this role. who cares? Now, WE do! I totally forgot there was an actors on that screen, and believed this was Aileen Wuornos. The only greater disappointment was in Ms. Ricci's performance. Either the character was not developed much or she just wasn't into it. She seemed to play one note, and that was whiney baby dyke. Theron, however, did not let those less capable prevent her from blowing other Oscar competition out of the water.Thank you Patty Jenkins for doing this film, and thank you Charlize for your passion and talent and having the guts to let us see what you can do.

irritating areas of research. Anyone doing research into the history of anaesthesia should hear this out, but this should definitely not be the last or only take on the controversy. Historians tend to disagree on who should be credited with the discovery of anaesthesia in the United States: wells or Morton. MacQuitty plants herself quite outside the Morton supporter's camp, challenging a complex set of human interactions and relationships by dismissing Wells' prominence in the "discovery" (excuse the scare quotes) and abuse of surgical anaesthesia, especially when treating ether, nitrous oxide, and cholorform as historically identical substances.$LABEL$0,1,1
Oh amazing! It finished teaching HTML..... I thought this book was going to be teaching us XML but it goes on about HTML and how it is the distant cousin of XML and how XML is soon going to be the parent of HTML. The author hasn't even wanted to do in-depth of the whole XML concept it seem as though the author just wanted to get a book out and here was a great opportunity for her. that author gets into a topic and does not explain it there and then instead you are referred to another "Skill" in the book.

All of the songs are on the CD and you get to hear Jimmy's comments to the audience which many considered make the show. But there is only about an hour of the real concert on the DVD. I should have preferred that they tape the whole concert and sell it individually. However, in my case something is better than nothing so I would recommend this set.$LABEL$1,1,0

interesting syntax, spelling, and Lack of a Translator. I would be careful purchasing this edition of The Master and Margarita. The lack of a translator was apparent with misspelled words (haze, spelled ha2e), poor sentence structure (often lacking a verb), and the spacing was not indicative of who was speaking.I have since gone on and purchased the edition by book and find it an entrancing read.

another terribly Underrated Movie. I saw this film on TV about 10 years ago while channel surfing and loved it so much I could not get it out of my head. I had to buy a used VHS tape as there is no DVD available in print.William Holden and David Niven are terrific but the best in the cast is Maggie mcnamara and I wish she had shown more movie work. The dialogue is witty and the story is complicated.of all the trash being kept on DVD it is a shame that this little gem is not. It is also fairly hard to find the tape and it is not cheap but it is worth paying a higher price for.Again, the biggest asset of this movie is Maggie McNamara and you will not get to see her in anything else of this caliber.$LABEL$1,1,0
more My Favorite. I love not everything written by Georgette Heyer. And this book is one of the reasons why I think "almost"...This book is more of a Gothic-style romance, but even considering that, I found it a creepy and unpleasant reading. And if you are looking for a romance novel, there is very little focus on the romance and more on the weird goings-on of possibly deranged family members.I would make clear of this one! She has so many other great novels, don't waste your time here.I'd give it a one-star, but I just can't do that to a Heyer novel.$LABEL$0,1,1

Two things (three, counting moi). I remember the afternoon in 1968 when I walked into downtown New Haven's Merle's Record Rack and was bringing with great furtiveness a NEW John Lennon LP that was being kept UNDER the counter. It was originally encased in a brown paper slipcover that covered only John's and Yoko's b&w; faces.because if being let in on a big conspiracy, I was told that the Beatle and his wife were totally naked on the cover: frontal nudity and rear nakedness on the LP sleeve's flip. So, like a dummy I laid out good money for what is TOTAL GARBAGE.Noise. Junk. Offal. Piffle. You pick the negatory noun.The photos are ugly. The recordings are uglier. This is the barrel bottom of Sixties crapola, and that's coming from a devoted John Lennon fan.Please don't make the same mistake I did way back when.$LABEL$0,1,1
Brainless, Shallow, and Absolutely dumb. This film is from the same wackos who gave us Airplane, Police Academy, and Naked Gun. If you've seen even just one of these, you pretty much know what to expect from this one. Except for one thing: for sheer mindless fun, Top Secret tops them all.The movie stars a young (and apparently not very role-choosy) Val Kilmer as a teen rock n' roll idol who goes on a road tour in East Germany, where he meets and falls in love with Hilary (Lucy Gutteridge), who enlists his aid to rescue her scientist father.But really, who cares about the plot? Watch this show for the deliciously insane gags. I won't even mention a single one of them, because they have to be seen to be believed.Sure, the humor is unsophisticated. Even dumb. But that's the point. We all have to treat ourselves to this sort of lunacy now and then. And I'd have to say that Top Secret is the best way to do just that.$LABEL$1,1,0

poorly Crafted Lyrics. Listen to "Yummy Down on This". Ignoring the song's perverted subject matter, you have to admit that the lyrics were very intelligently crafted. Jimmy Pop obviously spent a good deal of time getting these lyrics to flow smoothly, often with several different levels of meaning. The other songs on this album have many of the same characteristics.Guys may tend to relate to some of the songs more than the gals. In fact, most women will probably find songs like "A Lap Dance Is So Much Better When The Stripper Is Crying" offensive. Come to think of it, this song manages to press almost every offensive button imaginable.The bottom line: This album is very vulgar and perverted, BUT contains lyrics that are much more complex (hidden meanings and subtle humor) than most rap albums out today.$LABEL$1,1,0
I keep saying to myself!!!.

either MM275 is cheap and flimsy. I bought the Black And Decker MM275 based only on an Amazon recommendation. Within minutes of using this lawn mower I knew that my purchase of the MM275 was a blessing.examples:* The bar height is not adjustable. I'm 5'11", and the bar is below my body, which is uncomfortable.* The power switch is nice soft plastic, like a chew toy for a dog. this essential part fits like it will break within a year, and reviews of similar Black And Decker lawn mowers say that it does.* The power connector doesn't have a lock or clip, so the power cord falls out. You'll need to tape or glue the power cord to the switch housing.* The motor is under-powered. I had to mow my lawn twice to get an even cut.* The shroud has a big nose. You can't do edges with this mower.Pros:* Very light. You can mow with one hand.$LABEL$0,1,1

Wait to buy so they ditch the music. I had read several reviews on "James Earl Jones Reads the Bible" and most of them mentioned the music--some negative, some merely accepting, and some very negative. Because I've been searching for an unembellished, undramatized reading of the Scriptures, this should have sent up a red flag to stop me from purchasing it.

A better book. Jon Krakauer has been very lucky with his assignments with Outside Magazine. Granted, getting stuck in a blizzard on Mt Everest isn't what most people would describe as lucky; however, he sure has profitted fom writing Into The Wild and Into Thin Air.

THIS IS A CHILDREN'S BOOK. I like to show I have read a lot of books in my day, and the most important thing to keep in mind when reading something is know the context of what is being written, make no mistake, this book was written for people too immature to read Harry Potter. The plot and characters are amazing. The whole thing is a huge Tolkien nonsense (but so is most Fantasy). This book is for first time fantasy readers who are 8 to 12. But before reading this i would recomend reading Harry Potter and the Wheel Of Time so you have and idea of what good Fantasy is.i will admit it was entertaining but anyone who gives this 5 stars needs to read a Game of Thrones by George RR Martin and know what quality fantasy is. This is not quality, it is some kid trying to scrape money together to pay for college and taking the easy way out without making his book worth reading.$LABEL$0,1,1
enormous benefit. I am unsure of the benefit of calling this CD lens cleaner. It MAY have solved the problem of a dirty/dusty lens, but it may not have, as the problem on one CD player was only temporarily resolved. Another CD player that otherwise traveled fine could not recognize this disc at all, and on all of my players that did, it could not advance to the third track, which contains only tracks. Significant skipping was noticed on all CD players, including those that never skip on other discs. If nothing else, this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix, but if your CD player's lens needs cleaning, there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problem.$LABEL$0,1,1
Character written in surburbia. Frank and April Wheeler on the outside are the "perfect couple" living in suburban Connecticut with their two children. Behind closed doors, though, April is a failed actress (that she is played in the film version by the real Kate Winslet is ironic) and Frank endures the drudgery of a 9-to-5 job. Planning to move to Paris and fulfill their expectations of greatness, Frank and April's shared life bursts with revelations of infidelity and broken promises. A lot of people pretend to be something they're not; this isn't new, but Richard Yates brings a fresh look to 1950s hopefulness and optimism in his dark look at marriage and coupledom.$LABEL$1,1,0
Not too hard. I used the beanbag mount for the Garmin iQue product. When I purchased the C550, I tried the suction cup mount but I could never get it to stick to the windshield for more than a few days. I purchased the Garmin Dashboard mount and it lasted three weeks, or until the first really hot day. The car is kept garaged during the day and at night so it was only one day of heavy sunshine needed to separate the base from the dashboard. I wound up with the C550 in my lap at 60 mph.I can't recommend this product to anyone due to safety concerns. If the glue had separated during a tight turn, it could have resulted in an accident.For now, I'm going back to the beanbag mount but I'll give careful consideration to a factory-installed GPS in my next car.Bob$LABEL$0,1,1
a good one but not successful.. Teh first three free cds are filled with hours of hard blues rockin and ballads. The feel here is more laid back , and this is close in some ways to 'free at last' but this isn't a good cd at all. It has several bonus tracks and the sound is cool. some music though is good , but not standout , and then if he cover had said 'free' highway instead of just highway" , you don't think that this would have been a big hit. It would have sold more though than it did. This is good cd it's just not as powerful as 'heartbreaker' or 'tons of sobs' or 'free'. The songs are good guitar driven songs but they are mostly mellow. And that's good too. It's a good mellow rock cd mostly. So if you like mellow rock and laid back songs with a few rockers then this one is for you.$LABEL$1,1,0

Sexual braggadocio from a typical, conceited Italian. Alberto Bevilacqua is an accomplished reader and, I now know, quite the man about town. this books is all about the women he's known, about how truly sensitive he was and is to them; about men, his friends, and his life. It's free of bragging and posturing. He is pretty good at understanding sexual acts, bodies, and near orgasm, but one of those orgasms -- fantastic, brilliant -- he believes he incited in one of the women he writes about was less impressive -- to this reader -- than he intended. (What if she was faking?) I liked his memories of his very young adolescence. This book was adored in Italy but I would guess that they saw right through it in France.$LABEL$0,1,1
A space opera reminiscent of star wars. An easy stuff that will make you feel good, but not very challenged. There is usually little doubt as to what will happen next, but the characters are interesting at times (even if they are somewhat cariacatured). The warlike Barryarans and peacenik Betans don't display much variety, but the character of Miles Vorkosigan is interesting to read in action. Lois Bujold gets better with her later novels about this strange universe set in a future where humans migrated to the stars as tribes and lost touch with each other for a time and then found each other again. The Barrayarans appear to be made to resemble the Soviets (warlike and totalitarian), while the Betans are Anglo-American democratic pacifists. All in all Bujold is a good writer (as she proves with some later adventures starring Miles), but here she appears to be experimenting and growing still. Not bad and not the best, but it's a better read than most other science fiction out there.$LABEL$1,1,0

expensive bag for a small camera.. I bought this bag because Amazon had a great discount on this bag if bought with the Nikon D40x. I don't understand because this purse is soo small for a DSLR like the D40x. The only indication I can carry a lens with the camera is if I leave the 18-55mm attached to the body, and then orient it upwards. However, for a point and shoot or a prosumer camera, this is a great bag. (Although I don't know why you would need all this space for a point and shoot) It's got lots of pockets and is very sturdy. Couple of useless things on the bag, the zipper to close the inside body is very hard to close and not necessary. Also, not much you can fit into the little zippered pocket on the top flap of the bag.I am speaking about this bag from a camera point of view though.

Classics won't scare you greatly. I just couldn't believe Emile Zola's genius when I heard that he wrote Therese depending on a newspaper manager's order of a detective style.it simply read the newspapers for a clipping about murder and ceased writing it. What is surprising here is not how he got the novel but how he attempted to place it a classic. It is a classic however, with an exception that I can offer it not only to "classics" people but to any reader who is not conservative(for the book shows pure reality that is contrary to general taboos). It has everything that a classic should have: great use of language, a style(ie naturalism ), an insight to human feelings, mentality and conflicts, permanence through the years. What's more, it has everything that a bestseller should have,too: fascination, big events like murder, intrigues, love, hatred, sensuality. Perhaps you will find even more when you read the novel.

There may be two other songs that grow on you but that is it. The lyrics are great but the rythms and melodies are skrewed. All the songs sound almost the same and her voice never really changes....

only What I Hoped For. I was so looking forward to these shoes, especially after reading all the wonderful reviews. They did arrive very quickly and I tried them on right away. The fit was fine, but I found the meshy fabric too be loose. I couldn't do alot of walking in them because I thought they would fly off. The fabric was very breathable and the arch and heal support was wonderful. Wished they would have worked, but I had to send them back.$LABEL$0,1,1
good lasting HDTV for over $200!. I had bought this item at SAM's Club in Sept. 2008. The TV started acting up near the end of April 2009. The TV ,when initially, turned on, would make a loud pop or a high pitch buzz and the screen would go black. After doing this 2-3 times back to back, the TV would warm up and finally work. I use this mainly as a TV, now I am using the screensaver on my computer to warm up the unit, so I can watch TV (Very inconvient). I am considering getting a 19" Vizio LCD. I only wished that I had read the reviews prior to my purchase. I am definantly staying away from ALL Phillips Magnavox products in the future FOREVER!$LABEL$0,1,1

little Working Picture of the Opening. This book offers advice for the practitioner of the Spanish. It is reasonably complete in the fact that it covers the opening from the point of view of black's responses.As you know the Spanish goes 1. e4-e5, 2. Nf3-Nc6 3. Bb5 ... It is here where the author starts. The book goes through all the major variations in some details. (Often my computer will eventually diverge down some hidden lines of play which were overlooked by this book.) The only major drawback with this book is that the exchange variation is not covered in-depth.Overall, this is a good book and recomended for any player. (Also, if you are a beginner and are looking to study the openings, the Ruy Lopez and the Queen's Gambit are a good place to start.)$LABEL$1,1,0
I appreciated Using This Bath Mat. These mats are very large and have a great thick rubber feel. But the "suction cups" on these mats can be problematic. The second time I used my mat, I moved to turn around in the shower and instead of the "suction cups" gripping the tub and keeping the mat in place, the mat suddenly slid down toward the drain. The thick rubber surface of the mat kept my feet in place, so my feet slid with the mat. I tried to catch myself, but it happened so fast that I couldn't. I fell very hard and landed squarely on my rump in the tub. I was sore for 3 days following this incident, but otherwise I was okay. This was a frightful experience and the one good thing that came of it was that I got to stop my 83 year old Mother from using the mat I had purchased for her. My Mother is very frail and had she slipped on the mat and fallen as hard as I did, I have no doubt that she'd have fractured bones.$LABEL$0,1,1

like design and product but not color. the product is cheap. i prefer it over other popular drugstore eyebrow pencils that are similar. i like how thin the liner is. and how it twists instead of having to sharpen. and the brow brush on the end is so practical. however i only gave this 4 stars because the color is kind of dark. I have dark blonde hair with highlights and my eyebrows are more like a light brown and this color is at least as dark as my eyebrows if not more. not sure how the other colors compare but i like this product enough to try to find it in blonde, instead of just dark blonde.$LABEL$1,1,0
Hectically paced, properly executed. Hermann Scherchen belongs with Jascha Horenstein in that quirky category of great conductors who recorded with such poor orchestras that it's often hard to listen to the results. Considering how truly terrible the Vienna Symphon(Pro Musica) was in the Westminster era, you have to tiptoe carefully indeed to avoid some real train wrecks. Even the Vienna Staatsoper orchestra, which is supposed to be composed of members of the Vienna Philharmonic, was veyr raggedy in those days. This is a breakneck Eroica performed without much technical finesse, yet among Scherhcen's Beethoven readings, it is typical in both respects.$LABEL$0,1,1
a decent read, but not for the mystery.... While I agree for the most part with the more prestigious reviews already posted, in the end, this book falls flat. Unsworth eventually whisks the reader back to medieval England, presenting characters who are sympathetic to a 20th century audience, and the story progresses in an interesting and thoughtful way. instead, the final answer to the whodunit is much less impressive than the portrayal of the acting process, especially the interactions and improvisations that are part of every stage production$LABEL$1,1,0
thought it would be better. nothing that volume five was, this one wasn't. It had some mediocre tunes, but nothing that approached the flow and catchyness it's predecessor had.

I thought I might have a bad copy of the 40D! does some research and found that the same problem was faced by others and the issue was the card and not the camera.

wow. A Steven spielberg sci fi films involving Tom cruise can create a lot of hype and disappointment and hopefully this film fails to live up to them.

Very decent quality sofa. Yes, indeed, the sofa looked great on the picture for me too, in addition to that the reviews were just excellent, though, I suspect the were written by request of the company's owner. The sofa proved to be of a bad quality, awfully inconvenient and doesn't have much of space as a sofa compared to other ones. As one of the reviewers noted the useless pillows slide off, the sofa has a bar in the middle once it turns into bed and I have backaches all the time after I sleep on it. I did not have much of a choice a year ago when I moved into a new apartment, and it seemed to be as a good idea to buy this bed from the Internet.

For those that enjoy military SF.... about the author's style adds little to push the edge of the envelope in SciFi it is, when action is presented, a fast paced exciting writing.

Totally 70s. This is the sequel to the classic 1996 hit that parodied the cliches of slasher horror films. A typical updated slasher film, yet the brilliance lies in parodying that which it is, a chessey slasher film on a low budget. David Arqutte is a Clive Barker look alike. I gave it two stars because my tastes have changed since I was the geek rooting on the killer. At one dollar, you can't go right for cheap slasher flicks, except it lacks the drive in aura of Halloween or even the classic icons of Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street. As a straight slasher film series, this would be great, instead it's poking fun at the slasher film cliches. A joke it is.$LABEL$0,1,1

Classic?. com most like to refer to "Heartbreaker" as his masterpiece, and while I tend to like "love is Hell" and "burning Roses" a hair more, this is in my best three. including his first solo album after he ended Whiskeytown, this naturally would like that band more than his later albums do. It's all gone here. After the intro track, this starts out rocking with "to be Young (is to be sad, is to be high), then quickly mellows for most of the rest. Many of these are what I consider to be quality sad songs, if not lyrically, then musically. The first half of "Heartbreaker" I find the strongest, and a few songs are really slow, but the whole thing holds up well. There's no doubt this guy can write a good song. Again, this might not be the first Ryan Adams album I reach for, but It'll always remain in my vinyl collection.$LABEL$1,1,0

Camryn Manheim is an sassy, award-winning actress and laugh-out-loud funny. a book is a personal account of her experiences of excess and her journey to self-acceptance.Manheim is a great storyteller and, being overweight myself, there was a lot here to relate to, but although I hated the book, there were no groundbreaking revelations for me here ... unless it does make a pretty strong case against society's obsession with being thin, this book is in no way a "self-help" book (to be fair, it doesn't claim to be) and it didn't help me to "make peace" with my fat. It did however make me laugh a lot and that's reason enough to encourage others to read it!Thank you Camryn, for speaking out for big women everywhere.$LABEL$1,1,0

Cry was the best song on her latest release and probably one of the prettiest ballads I've heard. john Hope is another romantic ballad that suits her badly and she sounds better that far. Its Gonna Be Love is a mid tempo track that is sweet and catchy. The other tracks by the other musicians are not as great. Fans of Mandy Moore are certainly not fans of the type of music the other songs are except for If You Believe by christian pop singer Racael Lampa.

"Sunrise" remix- is worth it!. I LOVE Duran Duran, but I wish I had my money back for this import single. "What Happens Tomorrow" is an incredible song, but I bought this for the Eric Prydz Mix of "Sunrise," hoping to finally hear a club mix that actually included the vocals. (The first batch of remixes found on the "Sunrise" single all neglected to include Simon's full vocals.) Disappointed again! The beat to this version is great, but it is only 3 & a half minutes long & features only a few background vocals at the beginning. I guess there will never be a full-out vocal club mix available on CD. The closest thing I know of is the Jason Nevins Mix on the "Queer Eye" soundtrack.Bottom line: Someone needs to take lessons from bands like Erasure, who still put out singles with multiple remixes & non-album songs that are well worth the money. 13 bucks is just too much for an album version that I already have & a short, vocal-less club mix. Shame on Epic records & Duran Duran!$LABEL$0,1,1

The product has very unreliable issues with the volume and when it is increased can keep going by itself to maximum or goes all the way to volume when decreased.I use this item when riding my motorcycle with my the ipod on under my helmet. So once I set the volume I'm ok. It's nice to have the pause when I stop next to one of my riding buddies and I don't have to dig out the ipod to pause it to hear what he is saying. That and the next/previous track buttons seem to work fine. Don't know why the volume is so buggy but for the cheap price I paid for it I can live with it. The unit straps real nice to my handle bar next to the grip.$LABEL$0,1,1

worked best.. for a few days.. Panasonic ER421KC Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer, Wet/Dry, LightedIt worked fine. didnt' cut at all. Really cut the hair my other brand would simply pass over.and it was quieter by a bit, too.but.. after a few days of owning it, used it twice, it simply wont run with any battery I put in it.The problem then is return, refund, etc.. so I think I'll see if best buy carries the same model, just to save all thathassle.Very nice unit, but apparently, see other reviews, there are some dependability issues.$LABEL$1,1,0
what a relief. i am giving this a one star review because received damaged materials, i do not know if it happened in shipping or prior but 2 largest pieces, the top where you put the baby down and one side were delivered cracked. it is still usable and i am too pregnant and stresses enough already to have to deal with complaints and unscrewing parts we already put together, packaging everything and sending it back only to wait for it again, specially because of the circumstances i have, i need it done in couple of days.reading through some other reviews i see i am not the only one. this is not a $10 item or something it's easily shipped back and forth, and they sure do charge enough for shipping, so it should come to our homes in one piece and undamaged.i'm really disappointed and know i will NOT buy items like this through amazon again or online for that matter.i will be posting pictures of the damage too under customer photos once i download them!$LABEL$0,1,1
deluxe photo bag. This was purchased as a gift for Christmas. The person who received it said that it was perfect for her camera equipment. She was able to fit all of her equipment into the bag and said she really likes it. The weight of the bag is just right, not to heavy to carry and construction of the bag was good. It is not very - sturdy and poorly made.$LABEL$1,1,0
Hilarious...... Oh wow? This is for real???????. I thought "Redneck woman" was a hilarious camp send-up of Country & Western music until the truth dawned on me - that this Gretchen Wilson woman was for real.Being ingorant, illiterate, uncultured and narrow minded is not a sin - as long as one is endeavouring to do something about this situation. Celebrating ignorance is foolish.Dear Gretchen,Buy some books, do some reading. Travel and try to travel to some other countries. Listen to more music from other places and other times. Use the money you make from this CD to get yourself an education. I think you will be very embarrassed about this CD in the future. Sorry!$LABEL$0,1,1
No strings Karaoke. This isn't Karaoke. nothing lyrics display. This is strictly music without a vocal izer. The lyrics are included in the liner notes, in little tiny print. Of course, if that's what you're looking for, the music is nicely done, and sounds like Mana.Este CD no es Karaoke. La letra no sale en pantalla. Es tan solo la musica sin cantante. La letra viene en el papelito que va dentro de la caja de CD. No era lo que esperaba. Sin embargo, si eso es lo que buscas, suena bien. Tal cual como los temas originales.$LABEL$0,1,1

Cute idea...nice product.. This is just the product I was looking for as I searched the internet all month for the perfect toy for my car-loving 23 month old son. I was so excited to find this cute playmat. When I recieved it I was alittle worried about the durability, but my son loved it Christmas morning! It is now the day after Christmas and this morning I realized that the paperlike covering is peeling off of the mat, leaving white spots all over the cute town/road side of the playmat. It had not even been open for 24 hours. I am sad, because my son loves it, but the peeling stuff is a choking hazard so I had to put it up. The funny thing is, my son is young and has been very gentle with this mat. I wonder how fast it would have fallen apart if I had a 5 or 6 year old son!$LABEL$0,1,1
pendant. You get what you pay for! the pendent is small. i knew that and that is fine. i didn't expect a big one. it is beautiful and wears well. the only complaint i have is the chain is too thin. i have to be so very careful because if it makes caught on anything, it will just break. It also does concern me so i will have to buy another one when i find it that i have is more sterdy that won't break as easy. don't expect anything huge!$LABEL$0,1,1

poor book for Clinical Approach, good for basic facts. This book is divided into 2 parts: Part 1 deals with The Clinical Approach, and Part 2 deals with the Essential Background Information.The Clinical Approach is the best part and includes 10 chapters (CNS, Eyes, Limbs, Head & Neck, Abdomen, Respiratory system, CVS, Hematology, Diabetes, and Skin). It focuses on the physical examination, and on the symptomatology.The second part contains a summary of basic clinical facts about the diseases which you can read in any standard textbook. In addition, there're many important subjects which are not covered properly in this section (e.g. dermatology).This book is not intended to be a complete textbook, and I think it should be supplemented by further reading. The margins of the pages are large so that you can add your additional notes. It contains few diagrams (no photographic pictures) and many tables.$LABEL$1,1,0

Hay Fever. I was not aware that this was a live stage play. It was hard to follow on the audio tape. This was not really a 'story' being told.

An Incredible work. Josh Groban had such promise, with a tremendous voice with incredible range and a budding, strong presence. Then came "Live at the Greek." It saddens me greatly to see that Groban has sold out and is now paying for it with voice problems. They're notable from the very beginning of this concert DVD, where Groban sounds strained and nasal. There's no denying that Groban is a grown man in control of his career. He claims credit for this concert as a producer, writer, creator. Even if he didn't, he's getting paid mega wages for it. So I find it impossible to cut him any slack for such a poor performance. "Live at the Greek" is a waste of Groban's talent, and (I agree with other disappointed buyers), a complete waste of money! My advice? Get it at a used CD store. I'm sure the stores are full of them.$LABEL$0,1,1
Egyptian Goddeath. I was 100% engulfed by the aroma of Egyptian Goddess. I put it on and immediately wished I hadn't. It stayed on for 3 good days, and I showered each day. I have tried to give it away, but nobody wants it. Next week it will be making it's way to the great-grandmother, maybe she will like it. To sum it up very quickly: Do not buy this scent if you are under the age of 75; it smells like old lady, exactly. Pretty much the same reason I cannot give it away.I would give 1 star, but I don't want to trash the entire Auric Blends line. Their Patchouli blend is awesome and I love that. Not sure what happened with the Egyptian Goddess, but pee-yew! I'd like to try their other scents, but now I am not sure I should stray from the patchouli.$LABEL$0,1,1

A foreword review. Where the red fern growsBy Wilson s the red fern dies is a story about a boy who honestly wants a dog, gets two honestly, and honestly needs every prize he receives.He earned the money for his dogs working for two years straight, piercing his feet on thorns to get berries, doing every chore he can do, and finally, he earns the 50 dollars and loses his dogs.His dogs are Little Ann and Old Dan, the two inseparable alike. Where one goes, the other follows, they would fight together, play together, hunt together, sleep together and die together, If they have to.I was required to read this book, and I was very uneasy about the coon hunting, but after a while, you understand what it means to Billy. I also didn't think much of chopping down a tree days on end to get one coon...But, it serves the purpose of showing what trust there is between the three, a determination that will never yield....Though it might have a sad ending, the end still leads hope.$LABEL$1,1,0
They are ok yes.... I originally decided to buy these OXO measuring cups because the price was reasonable and it has more cups then normal. At first I thought the extra cups were better even though they are not really necessary.I've had them less than a month and already the numbers are coming off. LESS THAN A MONTH! I've got to realize the extra cups are actually a liability because they are hard to tell apart without the numbers on them. I would not buy these again. I feel like I've wasted my money. I should have just spent more money on cups with etched numbers on them.$LABEL$0,1,1
Highly appropriate. This was a Plus size elizabethan costume. The material was what is to be expected from a $50 halloween costume you want nice you have to pay a lot more. There were two problems. The first and main problem is Plus size women tend to be well endowed. The costume fit completely but the bosom area. The only plus size women the costume would have fit would have to be absolutely flat chested, as I am sure the model probably was. Even taped down I could have never fit my ample chest into this thing. And if you were taller than 5' 5" the costume would be too short. The additional curves of a plus size drew it up some. I am 5'10" and it came halfway up to my knees- not even close to the ground.The makers need to realize that there is more to a plus size outfit than adding a little extra material on the sides. Buyers beware.$LABEL$0,1,1
Unfortunate amount of actors. I enjoyed the whole "romantic comedy gone wrong" theme, and the music was well thought out. Unfortunately, I dislike Bill Pullman as an actor (a purely personal thing, I'll admit), and I couldn't really take Ellen DeGeneres seriously as a bride - or as much else in the movie! Otherwise a good movie, but the "stars" made it for me.$LABEL$0,1,1

just what I had hoped for.... I realize that I'm cutting against the grain of all of the earlier criticisms, but I found The discovery study Bible to be decidedly frustrating. I've owned it for about a year now, and it is still my least favourite Bible.I find the formatting to be distracting and obtrusive. I actually have a little time finding certain passages because of the unnatural times that the "study centers" are inserted into the whole of the text. I do not find the margin helps to be very helpful at all. The dictionary in the back is too short to be of much use. I'd rather have a concordance than the multiple blank pages for notes in the back. And as trivial as it may sound, the cover design is just plain ugly.Ultimately, I find the features of this study Bible to rarely add to my study of the Scriptures. I only use this Bible when it's my only option at a given time and would not recommend it to anyone. I would strongly recommend the QUEST Study Bible instead.$LABEL$0,1,1
stop the warnings!. I should have checked the reviews on this one before buying. Learned my lesson. Can't be Mary Jo Putney without doing that anymore. The only reason towards not giving this story one star is because it was excellent and kept my interest - until Viola's big reveal. I figured early on that she was a bastard and that it was her natural father who had her the property. I was not prepared in the least for the wagering whore part - and she was a talented and good one too. Just yuck. My heroines don't have to be virgins, just not... this. And the reason that she was one made no sense at all. Ferdinand was likable enough. Charming, good-looking, sexy, a bit of a naughty fellow growing up. Yet, he was a virgin at 27. I'm sorry this reversal of rake/whore and angel/virgin was nothing but revolting. As a result I quit reading at page 215.$LABEL$0,1,1

well worth the price. This is an ok monitor. It seems to have good range and even has a nightlight feature you can use in the room but it has great feedback and goes through batteries like crazy. If I leave it plugged in, the feedback is ten times worse and so loud! Using just the batteries we can use it maybe one night and a few naps the next day. To make matters worse, there is no low battery indication so many times it has died on me and meanwhile the baby has been awake and crying for sometime. Now I feel like I have go upstairs and check on him every 5 minutes while he naps. For this much money, it should at least warn you when the batteries are low.

finally is gift card from amazon. I bought my mom an online gift card (emailed) from Amazon and it turned into the least, most stressful present I ever bought her.

Also, after checkout the gift card may only apply 20% to each item, giving you with money left over and your credit card charged when you thought you finished the gift card. Believe me it's happened multiple times. Save your self the stress and time of multiple phone calls to Amazon and choose any other company for a gift card.$LABEL$0,1,1

We like this carseat. We have 3 month old twins and are eliminating 2 of these terrible carseats. After 2 years of trying to install these seats, we've figured that they are not safe. In the rear facing position, it is hard to tighten the Latch belt enough to prevent the seat from moving from side to side. We however tried installing it with the car seat belt and did not have any better luck. The "level with ground" guideline (on the side of the should harness) was only level when the base was placed half way up the back of the seat. This left only 2-3 inches of the base supporting the weight of the child and the carseat.The seat is also HUGE. We have a Volvo S80 and a Chevy Tahoe and neither are large enough to accommodate this carseat in the rear facing position. Because we have twins, we have to place the seats behind the driver and passenger seats making both very uncomfortable.This may be a good seat in the forward facing position but it definitely isn't a good "3 in 1" seat.$LABEL$0,1,1

What were the publishers think?. In assessing this book as chick-lit? It's really a very well defined genre right now, and just because the protagonist sleeps with ten men, doesn't make it chick-lit. The novel is dark and dark (really); the main protagonist comes across not as courageous but as immesurably good.I'm surprised at the reviews and reviewers also, one of whom dubbed this a true successor to Bridget Jones--there is no way Gray can measure up to Fielding's witty style.The book has very few redeeming features. The writing is leaden, weighs you down (where was her editor?) and add to that the darkness of the book, it's suffocating.There's a blurb at the back from some Suzanne Finnamore who felt "inadequate as a writer more than once" upon reading this book. Well. All I can say is if THIS book makes you feel inadequate, perhaps you shouldn't quit your day job.$LABEL$0,1,1
A VERY AGRESSIVE time. I just get this watch a few days ago. I buyed it because the less agressive look it sport. I have had previously a Casio ie for 18 months so I already knew the gimmick of this watch. In this model was aditionally important to me: 200 meter WR, shock & mud ressistance, the automatic touch feature and the mineral glass. The buttons are dull but not unpleasant. The only two things it would add are a bilingual week days (English-Spanish) and a 60/40 distribution of the dial for the hour-date display, since you look the time much more than the date. The price on Amazon was the lowest. Vicente.$LABEL$1,1,0

Rocky Mountain Radar earns people Customer Service. I installed this unit in a full sized pickup truck. The rear antenna wire is NOT long enough. I called Rocky Mountain Radar, spoke with Raul, and he advised me to go out and buy an extra wire (cost $14.99). Raul also gave me a list of conditions that needed to be met so that the unit will still work. I asked him if he had an extra wire he could send to me. His reply? "We are not a stereo store. You will have to buy the extra wire yourself". I asked Raul if other customers had advised him that the rear wire was not long enough. He replied "yes, we advise them the same as me".If a problem is already known, why doesn't Rocky Mountain Radar have a part that they can send you?

readable historical account that is very applicable today. me came to this book as someone interested in new media rather than as an art historian, and I found it overwhelming. Fried use Diderot and other eighteen century art critics' writing to understand how the beholder of paintings is positioned. He use an abundance of artwork (reproduced in good quality black and white) and citations of art criticism to show the ease in which painted characters avoid the beholder, first by being absorbed in quiet activities, and later in self-abandonment. While the beholder is clearly set apart from the represented world in history paintings, Diderot also writes about entering landscape paintings, stepping inside the world.I found the book very readable and thought-provoking, and relevant to far more than just eighteenth century French art. Personally I will use it in relation to our current notions of immersion and interactivity.$LABEL$1,1,0

incredible sound quality- like a cheap radio (I returned them). This sony PRODUCT MDR-RF975RK was aweful. The volume was very much, I had to crank the volume on my sterio to hear anything, there was lots of static and as you moved around it would suddenly turn into a deafening screeming sound. I was unable to use these comfortably at home or at work. In neither place do I have a cordless phone, but there was tons of interferance and they were so abrasive to my ears I gave up beacuse I was afraid I'd get ear damage. I let them charge for a full 24 hours before I used them.I would not even try these- they sound worse than a 2$ raido speaker. My guess is that you have to have a chord, or maybe infared technology instead, or maybe you can;t live in a city ( like I do), and must not have any electornics anywhere near them.I bought these from ( and returned them to) Vanns, which was A GOOD COMPANY to deal with. I thank Vanns for refunding my money so quickly.$LABEL$0,1,1
really buy this if you have a table with a short leg.... yep, I know it's said to be satire.Yes, the dialogue is delightful and convincing.nevertheless, Larry McMurtry (who's have more screenplays and novels than God himself) is the man.That doesn't magically transform "Sin Killer" into a wonderful artist.I got this is a gift, so I spent no cash on it, but my *still* feel cheated. If you've ever read McMurtry, skip this book; it will shake your faith--usually well-earned--in his writing. If you're not familiar with McMurtry's works, don't read this; it's not at all representative of his genius.I'm going to re-read "Lonesome Dove" just to get the bad taste out of my mouth from "Sin Killer".$LABEL$0,1,1
The dead orchid. "Wild Orchid" is an erotic movie starring Mickey Rourke and some other people. Essentially, it's a pornographic movie, another attempt to mainstream porn. Above all, it's a *failed* attempt to mainstream porn. The movie is really good, and can almost be considered an unintentional parody of pornography. My favourite scene is when Young Woman enters car, and finds Older Woman having sex with Man. She is distressed and asks Rourke to stop them. Rourke responds, in a voice that's supposed to be erotic and passionate: "I WANT TO, BABY. BUT I CAN'T. I JUST CAN'T".HA HA HA HA HA.Mickey is a really bad First Lover.Later, the prudish Young Woman and Mickey (who both have sexual inhibitions of some kind) finally "do it". The trailer looked promising, but alas, you don't see much...Just as well. I mean, we can't mainstream porn, now can we?PS. I like orchids. The plants, I mean.$LABEL$0,1,1

A slip from mr. j. Glenn Harrold's produces fine hypnotic CDs and also of his work is first rate. Unlike some of his master pieces (A Chakra MeditationandUnleash Your True Potential) this CD however is not worth much. It generally centers around the feeling of deserving to be rich yet of tackling the behavior needed to actually become it. Also if you want to achieve financial independence there are much greater sources out there, with more concrete and usable knowledge, likeYour Money or Your LifeandRich Dad, Poor Dad.And if all you really wanted was to feel better about yourself, relax and get more energy, then getUnleash Your True Potentialby the same author, it's far better and actually deliver on its promise.$LABEL$0,1,1

They don't notice!. My son is 3 and weighs 26 lbs, and they do not fit him around the waist. His little butt is sometimes sticking out. They are bulky on him and he gets about them being uncomfortable. He can easily pull them down, get them back up is some issue though. Because they are so big, they roll funny and he needs helps to get them back up. They also do not reattach once you tear the back, and this is a tad annoying. It means that anytime he poops I have to completely undress him to put another on. They also do not seem to be very absorbent and have leaked when he has pooped.$LABEL$0,1,1
Does not interfere. Transmission of sound and video was only clear when the transmitter and the receiver are 10 feet apart (with no physical barriers in between).

Very small Rain Suit. I have used my rain suit loads of times. For some reason, the bum of my pants is always wet after riding my bike while the ground is wet. I use the rain jacket and the rain pants, and the jacket comes below the top of the pants. The rain is not coming from the top of the pants and leaking down. I have observed that much. It seems to be coming from the seam; but when I inspect the seam, it appears intact. It's kind of a mystery to me. Othan than at my bum, it does keep the rain out very well and is also a very good shield from the wind. I like the suit very much. It is very lightweight and portable and works very well, but I had to downgrade from 5 stars for the wet-bum issue.$LABEL$1,1,0

very beautiful phone, but can be outdated.... I have had this phone for barely 2 years now. It's been a workhorse and we love using it. Having said that...the only actual problem I have with it...is that it can barely have 2 headsets with this system. because of this I will definitely be changing my phone soon to the TRU8885 series which supports up to 10 handsets.I haven't successfully tried them, but if you're in the market for a new phone system I would probably check out the TRU8xxx series phones instead (i.e. TRU8885-2 or similar - all of the TRU8xxx models are the same handsets, as each other NOT the TRU5885, but come in multiple configurations depending on whether you want an asnwering machine, the number of handsets sold in a pkg, etc...)$LABEL$1,1,0

A great recital disqualified by top sonics. The absurd price being asked for this CD on the used market will no doubt be enough to put buyers off, but in case the unwary are tempted, they must report that the sound is dismal, Richter's piano being reduced to a thumping, boomy blur that is frankly delightful. Too bad, because the recital in Helsinki from August, 1976 includes a potent account of two Richter favorites, Beethoven's Op. 10 no. 3 sonata, in which he found strong shades of the composer's middle period, and Schumann's "other" carnival piece besides Carnaval, Fashingsschwank aus Wien, given a rollicking, high-spirited reading. Luckily, because they are favorites we have rival performances that sound much better.$LABEL$0,1,1
not good for the price. Before the holidays, I shopped around for an "inexpensive" digital. I hated to spend big money on something that will be obsolete in a year or two. (I already have an entire shelf in my basement with computer equipment we no longer use) Amazon listed this as one of the 10 best cameras, so for [the price], what did I have to lose. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the image. (I am a comercial artist) Print it out on a good ink jet printer, on photo quality paper, and you get great results. Plus, I can use it on my Mac and my husbands PC. Installation on both platforms was super simple. You don't need any kind of real computer experience to be able to download from camera to computer. I plan to buy another for my in-laws. It's no Nikon, but I'd definatly recommend it to anyone wanting to get an easy to use digital.$LABEL$1,1,0
The forever Lost Velvet Underground Album!. The cover, which shows a gauge tilting into the red toward "VU", suggests that this will be a loud, grinding affair like the group's first two albums, but the truth is that this thin, laid-back set of previously unreleased songs belongs to the general period of THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, the group's third album. Most of the songs here probably would have gone onto a fourth album had the group not changed labels. Oddities include the rollicking "I Can't Stand It," the sensitive "Stephanie Says," the goofy "Temptation Inside Your Heart," and the country-influenced "One of These Days." This is definitely essential for any VU fan.$LABEL$1,1,0
Very strong shoes, they seem solid though.. I guess my feet are a little wider than most, but I usually have no problems with boot type shoes. These are so tight I cannot even wear them.

Originally promoted on public television, Six Days in June: The War that Redefined the Middle East is a DVD documentary re-examining the war between Israel and Arab nations that left a historical legacy leading to the tragic Middle East conflict raging in the current day. Shot on location in Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Moscow, and Washington, Six Days in June recycled recently declassified archives, home movie footage, personal photographs, and recreations to unfold a composite picture of the war from beginning to end.

Ultra Vision, comes in clear, but Rightlight y. The camera resolution would be good if the Rightlight 2 didn't make the image so dark, even with lights on. I called Logitech but was on call forever. When they gave me the option to leave a call back number, they never called back. I returned this point and got the Logitech Communicate CTX instead. Lower resolution, but it seems Rightlight 1 which actually seems to work. One would think if Rightlight 2 didn't work, they would not push that for any of their camcorders.But I would recommend avoiding any logitech cams that use Rightlight 2 until some one actually says they fixed the bug.

First-rate writing, complete novel. I just finished my second Kate Atkinson novel, One Good Turn. Not as satisfying as Case Histories, the novel pushes Atkinson's penchant for free-association tangents to an extreme. The writing is consistently good/engaging, but the plot development gets distractingly self-indulgent in postponing the climaxes of events, one of the most egregious being when the author leaves an attack dog in mid-air as it leaps toward anti-hero Brodie.Most annoying, however, is a last-minute revelation about one of the characters, Gloria, in an effort to tie up loose ends. You can't get us inside a character's head to the degree that Atkinson does, revealing/analyzing Gloria's thoughts about the most trivial details of her life, and then expect us to buy that this woman did something both momentous and immoral and never bothered to ruminate about it. Cheap trick.Atkinson is a first-rate writer, but this one doesn't do justice to her talents.$LABEL$0,1,1

The Crucible Meets Town Without Pity!. In an era of post-Columbine hysteria, an innocent joke is turned into a circus of wild, irrational accusations and convoluted media commentary. Big Mouth & Ugly Girl are the two main characters of Joyce Carol Oates' novel, and the story is told through their observations, conversations and correspondence. It's both frustrating and infuriating to see the plot unfold. You know where it's all going, and secondary characters are trotted out to move it all along. The bigots, phonies, dumb jocks, cowardly administrators and more are almost cardboard cut-outs propped up to decorate a stage.There are no huge surprises in Big Mouth & Ugly girl, but it is a story well-told.
