well worked!. I bought cube world for my daughter this december year, and the stick figures will NOT interact no matter what we do. We tried breaking the batteries, cleaning the connections, restarting the cubes...nothing!!!!

hmm, a wee bit far-fetched. Retired Secret Service Agent Swamp Morgan is sent to handle a potential 'firefly' case involving the murder of several doctors and nurses at a plastic surgery clinic. Apparently the doctors are in the habit of taping their patients while they are recovering from surgery and blackmailing them with the details at a later date. During one of the recovered transcripts a suspicious transcript surfaces about a bomb plot. Could it just be the ramblings of an unconcious man, or something more sinsiter?This story starts off a bit slow with the killer targeting the doctors and nurses. But the character, Swamp is likeable and methodical in his detective work. The middle section involves Connie, a nurse who was off-duty the night of the murder and her struggle with being bait for the killer.I'm giving this 4 stars just because the ending was really goofy. I can't give it away, but... Well... It was a gotcha type ending you are either going to like or loathe.$LABEL$1,1,0
bad WORKOUT!. This workout is awesome, but only for people who are already pretty in shape. I would say this is for those people who don't have problems with their backs, knees or really anthing else and that just have a few stubborn pounds to lose and want to tone up. It is really hard, I'm on my 4th week and it's still hard but it's getting a little easier and I love it.

Box Very Damaged, Didn't break. The top I received looked as though it had been through a war. They be used to change shippers or package this product so it can be shipped more than a variety of formats.I had this product shipped twice!! The first was sold, the second I didn't even bother taking it off the truck.so I contacted Grizzly they suggests I buy it from a local source. in other words serve your business elsewhere. I find it incredible that a company that ships products all over the world can't seem to package it properly so that it will arrive in reasonable condition. The "Shop Fox" supports I bought with this were in TERRIBLE shape! A local merchant says Shop FOX is owned by Grizzly and they sluff off their damaged or unsaleable products through Grizzly. I have ordered the supports through a local merchant. We will see if they arrive directly from Shop Fox in good condition.Shop Fox H2612 Super Heavy-Duty Workbench Leg System$LABEL$0,1,1
Shin Noodles. I had purchased this for my spring break for when my boyfriend came into town, just because I thought it would be a nice little treat for him. Turns out they used to sell Shin everywhere in WA. I had even checked because they don't in MI. So when he caught me pull this out of the bag, he started flipping out in excitement. "crap!!!!!"I let him cook it the way he likes it, and I will say, this soup is better than Maruchan's. Hands down. I would order this again in the future. I highly recommend it, especially if you like spicy things.$LABEL$1,1,0
Don't doubt your money!. My husband bought me the Magic Bullet for Christmas. He paid $60 for it at a department store. At first I was so impressed by it. We used it almost every day. When we had our first baby I used it to make homemade baby food to save money. I will honestly say that it does work very well....AT ease. You'll love it, then be disappointed when it breaks. Before 1 year was up the motor died and it stopped working. This also happened to three of my friends who bought the magic bullet. The customer service stinks and they won't replace it. In my opinion, $60 for 1 year of use is not worth it. You'd be better off spending less on a generic brand blender that does the same thing. I bought a less expensive brand on sale for $15 and so far it works just as well as the Magic Bullet for a fraction of the price!$LABEL$0,1,1
Short of Learning Latin, Greek, etc.. Dear Potential citation:I have anything but praise for Dr. Danner's _Discover It_. He has taken one of the best methods for self-help purposes, the graduated inductive method, and combined it with simple information about the origins of English words. The reader is led, step by step, into developing an ever larger and more expansive English vocabulary. I would say that anyone who works through the actual book will acquire a level of etymological knowledge and a facility with English vocabulary that normally could only be produced by a course in etymology taught at the college level. My own preference would be for students to learn the relevant languages; _semper nobis linguae addiscendae sunt_. But short of learning Latin, Greek, French, and German, you can do nothing better for building your English vocabulary than to buy and use Danner's _Discover It!_. I highly recommend it.$LABEL$1,1,0

just A Celebrity Could Get This author Published. till this manuscript arrived in a publisher's office and been submitted by a writer who did not enjoy national fame, this book would never have been printed. I am glad the book came to me as a gift, because otherwise I would be asked a refund. Russert might be a decent guy who appreciates his heritage, but that doesn't automatically result in a compelling story. bringing the last chapter to the Buffalo Bills football team reflects the author's misjudgment--evident throughout the book--about what readers want from a national political commentator.$LABEL$0,1,1

Ranch Style enough to become a fast one. I've been eating Ranch Style Beans all my life and love them. They were made in Fort Worth, Texas for nearly a hundred years. This year, they were bought by ConAgra, the plant was closed and production was moved to Ohio. That's not all that was changed. The cans used to be brimming with beans with just enough sauce. Now fully a third of each can is sauce...they're selling us WATER. They taste the same and for that I'm grateful, but the can says "Beans" and I expect beans...not water. Some slick suit has decided to maximize profit by compromising the brand. Won't work here and I've bought my last can until I can shake the can and it sounds like it has more beans than water. And why would anyone pay almost $50 for a case? I can buy them at Sam's Wholesale Club for $12.00 a case.$LABEL$0,1,1

Covers important aspects but has depth. I teach AI at the graduate level in a major US research University, and I specialize in the area. The books does cover many different areas of Machine Learning. Unfortunately, the treatment is quite extensive.

Roots of Blink 182. Those of you familiar with Cheshire Cat will readily know a few tracks on this album, their 1994 effort. Buddha was made during the first year that the band were together, and it shows their tendency toward whimsical, sometimes silly lyrics. It perhaps more accurately portrays their punk roots than the later albums, where they define a genre of their own. the songs are short, rushed and frenetic. The vocals are more shouted than sung.you recommend it, not if your only exposure to Blink is Enema or Mark & Tom Show. It'll take a bit of getting used to, but you'll have a greater appreciation for the band, and you'll enjoy it.$LABEL$1,1,0

drama in the chillout. Zen...2 has a different vibe from 1. More European more pop. Inverno one with Sketches of Egypt followed with Deniz is very dramatic. any release of Vol 1 is replaced by a nod to 80's pop. A touch over the top/camp. only the laswell/wobble selection is pretty upbeat! Nothing good. A theatrical sidestep from Vol 1. Nice but don't expect it to take you where the actual vol went.

Great movie, huge DVD. This is one of those classic SciFi movies that scared the 'bgeezus out of every kid who saw it in the 50's/60's. After viewing the spectacular anniversary edition DVD of "The Day the Earth Stood Still," I expected a comparable treatment of "Invaders from Mars" (especially for the price). But no ... the image quality of this Image Entertainment DVD is ....: scratches, blips, and poor color rendition abound. An undergrad film major could have done a better post-production job. Maybe that's who Image Entertainment employs? I see the company's Director recently resigned -- hopefully in shame after seeing their effort (or lack thereof) on this project.

boring, self less.... she really has a cushy life - how many people could go a year off to 'give themselves', especially in their middle thirties? She makes her way through Italy and gains weight - but remember, she NEEDED to gain as her terrible ex-husband had made a real stink about the property division, and she had lost weight worrying about this. No one else has ever had divorce problems. Well, not been hers as she is so special. She then goes to India to live in an ashram - a Special ashram where only a few people are allowed, by appointment - to 'find God', who is actually revealed to her... (did I mention she is special?) I think she was going on to the gorgeous island of Bali, where she was to find True Love, but I got so bored at this point I took it back to the library. She complains and complains about how bad her life has been. Well, everything is relative but to most people, her life is cushy.$LABEL$0,1,1

amazing writing on a fascinating topic. I'm sure Richard Ellis is a fine fellow. plus I just can't understand how _anyone_ gave this book a positive review, and I'm 2/3 through it. The redundancies are ridiculous; it's like he never reread or edited. so on page 108 he gives you a long quote from what he tells you is an article from Roper and Boss -- and in _the very next paragraph_ he gives you _the same quote_ again and attributes it! Amazing! And this kind of thing happens continually. How many times does he tell me how big, say, squid axons are versus human axons? I mean, really: this book went totally unedited. Beyond that the comments of other reviewers that he kind of struggles to fill a book about the squid, are true. Of course some of the amazing footage of the past couple years could've been used to pad it out another chapter, but, there's just not enough there there, or at least Ellis isn't able to make it seem so.$LABEL$0,1,1

Printer not without the time or money!. I received this printer as a gift. I realised it was a great thing to be possible to take the printer to family functions, taking a picture, and prove it to the family right away! I only had the printer two years, with little use and various troubles. some paper that is supplied with the ink kit began to slip. This became an expensive ordeal, considering I could simply download the digital images to a local store and have them printed for as low as 17 cents a copy. It does take up space in the suitcase, with carrying the printer/powercord/USB cable/ink paper and tray. I used it very little and it recently started to print on only one-half of the photo paper! I contacted Canon, after some basic cleaning and trouble shooting. Canon could not offer any further advice, except that I would need to send it in for repair. Since it was out of warranty, and not worth the time or money, it is now in the trash...$LABEL$0,1,1

650 Holster. This holster doesn't used to fit the Treo 650 phone very loosely. The bottom corners of the phone are rounded and the bottom corners of the holster are wider. The side supports don't fully hug the phone and prevent me concerned about the phone coming out of the holster too easily. The top support clips the phone tight at the slot for the memory card and doesn't need sturdy enough to keep the phone in the holster. With an expensive version like a Treo 650, I just don't get a secure feeling from this holster that it will keep my phone safe and on my belt. I refused to take that chance and will not use this holster. In fact, I already purchased the leather TREO holster manufactured by PALM for about $20.00$LABEL$0,1,1

My favorite vegetarian "meat" was. I grew up on this stuff. It's so quick and easy to have. me love that it's never greasy or funky smelling before real ground beef and there's forever a danger of e-coli from not cooking it enough. It's never cruelty free. No animals had to die in the process! disgusting!I use it for chili, taco filling, and it's easy to taste beef patties just by adding bread crumbs, eggs and seasonings. It can even be formed into meatloaf or meatballs. I've made Hamburger Helper with it before which was pretty good. Its uses are endless. I'd love to try this in shepherd's pie. Loma Linda makes the best vegetarian "meat" products.$LABEL$1,1,0
quite Recommended. While browsing on Amazon for free books, I found this one. I enjoyed it until the ending. THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN! Nor horse lovers that like happy endings. It's a good thing it was free, and also that I can't write a note of disapproval to the author.Soldier Boy is Buffalo Bill's horse, and the book is told partly through his viewpoint, partly in letters from humans and partly with Soldier Boy talking to other animals.An interesting tale of the old west, with a young girl named Cathy who arrives from Spain and bonds with her beloved Soldier Boy.I wonder if Twain planned the ending from the get go, or if he just wanted to finish it quickly...and finish off the main characters, too. I'd love to know why he ended the story in such a gruesome way (a bullfight in Spain).Despite my love of reading about anything equine, I don't recommend this book.$LABEL$0,1,1

The color Honeymooners are just as good as the ones made in the 1950s, and they're in dark color complete with cheery musical numbers with professional dancers and silly choral arrangements. It has been a long wait and I'm going to be the first to buy the next DVD, or next 9 episodes. i MPI would put them out a bit faster, although.

Cute beads, but easy to use. My daughter received this bead set for her 3rd birthday. The hand painted beads are bright and attractive, and she was eager to start beading. However, the rough texture of the wood on the inside of the beads makes it a frustrating experience- she isn't able to bead without assistance. We ended up exchanging the beads for a set with a smoother interior surface. My sister also purchased these beads for her nearly three year old, and she had the same experience; her daughter was unable to string the beads- the laces snag on the rough interior surface, making it difficult to bead.$LABEL$0,1,1

expensive camcorder at an unbelievable price. When its time for me to replace my old Mini-DV camcorder I made an extensive research whether to buy another old technology camcorder (mini-dv or DVD based) or buy a new technology camcorder (HD or hard drive based). I finally compromised on buying this, since this is a compromise between old and new. It uses 3CCD technology which is cool because the same tech. is used in professional cameras.Am I satisfied with my purchase? A big Yes. Especially the capability to record still images on a SD card at an amazing clarity eliminated the need for me to carry both camcorder and digital camera.I would recommend to buy this to anyone who is looking for a budget camcorder but do not want to compromise on quality.$LABEL$1,1,0

I am not very thrilled with the book since it does not cover concepts in detail (with examples in the text) instead it has questions at the end of the chapter but they do not offer the solutions in the book or online so it makes it easy to know if you are understanding and getting the questions correct.

not user specific, Adobe won't offer supports. We bought Adobe photoshop elements 6 and premiere elements 4 as a package in late 2007. It was not user friendly software at all, but after much painful reasearch we were able to perform great tasks. (The main purpose of the software was to create slideshows and burn them to DVDs, and otherwise that wasn't easy to figure out.) Last year it worked well on our old computer, but when we got a new computer with Windows Vista it wouldn't work. I can create slidewhows, but I get an error message every time I hit the button to burn them do a DVD. I called adobe for some help, AND THEY DON'T OFFER SUPPORT FOR PREMIERE ELEMENTS 4.0 ANYMORE. It's only two years old. I guess if you don't fork out the cash to upgrade every year, adobe isn't interested in helping you.Terrible product. Terrible support.

Not as bad as it sounds. Instead of buying this book, I went to the library to check it out and after reading the other reviews, I was very impressed. This book has little to do with "sanity saving" it's mostly just letters of unique situations written to the author of this book. He replies with common sense advice and even sometimes advice that "beats around the bush" (indirect advice). For the average healthy bride I recommend reading the book by the Knot (don't remember what it is called but it has "The Knot" in the title). I also got that at the library and it has absolutely everything! No need to get another book. It offers real "sanity saving" advice and some real life stories for all situations. But if I have to say something positive about the other book, it does have a cute cover... but thats about it.$LABEL$0,1,1
Decorative Fishing Creel. When I purchased the River's Edge Fishing Creel, I worried by the price, that it would not be durable enough to also do in fishing. I purchased the creel for my wives as a decorative creel that she could either plant blossom in it, or use with artificial flowers. While the main body of the creel seems durable enough, the straps that are attached are not, thus the way that the lid of the creel is attached to the main basket is to flimsy. "You get what you pay for." I am happy with the creel for the decorative purpose for which it was purchased, and my wife is using it for that purpose.$LABEL$0,1,1
The only required study tool for the GRE. After purchasing both the sentinel and Princeton Review GRE books, I found that this book is the only one that is essential for studying for the GRE. While other books contain some helpful things (particularly vocab lists) this official book from the GRE is unnecessary because it contains certain past GRE exams. Other writers write model exams similar to the GRE, but because the questions have not been properly tested, the questions on these models exams are oftentimes confusing and ultimately just flat out wrong. My scores on the exams in the Barron's and Princeton Review books were not indicative of the score I actually received on the GRE, only "Practicing to take the GRE General Test" gave me a good idea of where I stood in my preparation for the test.$LABEL$1,1,0
Harvest Moon. Harvest Moon is a gambling app where you're racing the clock as well as horses and dogs in the local festivals and events.This game depicts some what responsibility in raising animals,crops,and even a family on your grandfather's cheap and run-down farm. In this game you make friends and enemies and you can only have a wife and child of your own. There are more different sences such as the mountains where you can fish and gather plants, to the beach where you can fish and swim, to the town square were you can buy seeds and animals. I hope you have fun playing Harvest Moon!$LABEL$1,1,0

Bernier gives a true look at France's most famous king.. The book, "Louis XIV: A Royal Life," by Olivier Bernier, is a faux historical guide to the life, reign, and love affairs of Louis XIV, the Sun King of France. The book actually begins telling of the night Louis was conceived at a hunting lodge. Bernier gives a true look at France's most famous king from his early childhood to his death in 1715 by gangrene in his leg. The Fronde, the wars against England, and the War for Spanish Succession are covered in depth by Bernier. This is the book for anyone interested in Louis XIV of French history$LABEL$1,1,0
please, beware binding. I bought this book to use for a horse class at a local college. My first warning is the binding! It doesn't take long, or too many times of opening the book before the glue comes undone and sections of the book fall out. I tried my best to be delicate to avoid this from happening but, it still came apart.Some of the information is written in a confusing manner and some things are not entirely up to date. The non-updated information is not abundant and one can still learn plenty of information by reading this book.The book does cover everything from the possible cost to the mechanics of a horse, and many other things. It is a good book to have if you're new to horses. But, I would only buy it if you can find a cheap price on it. Simply because of the binding falling apart.$LABEL$1,1,0
A bad follow-up book. This book picks up seconds after book one. By the end of the book I was left thinking that this was a perfect ending to the story. Here again we see Geordi dealing with his love interest Leah Brahams. She has been busy moving up the chain of command and now has a crew of her own. The crew of the Enterprise start succuming to the aliens that set off the Genesis Wave in order to save their dying civilization. Billions are dead and the Klingons are in the unconventional roll of acting as transport ships of the injured and refugees left in the wake of a massive evacuation that has decimated much of the alpha quadrant.Makes a nice tie-in to the Star Trek S.C.E. series.$LABEL$1,1,0

spot on, what a disappointment. Why do the authors in the fantasy have this new 'n habit of writing huge 'epic' series filled basically with subplots and only a few main jokes?All the so-called 'fantasy kings'- Jordan, Terry martin and now GRR i have disappointed me greatly. the 'epic' style is very sophisticated, more than a soap opera than an epic. Tolkien wrote epic and grand narratives, but were they neverending, exciting creations? I had more hopes for this particular series but the author appears to be squandering it away with another Jordan-like fiasco. If you want tightly woven, well-written fantasy, don't expect to be satisfied here. Look at Pullman's provocative and beautiful His Dark Materials, or Ursula K Leguin's thoughtful trilogy. Or go back to the major figure in the genre, Tolkien, and see why these authors are worth reading. These books are more like Swords-and-sorcery Grisham then fantasy. The genre really is going downhill.$LABEL$0,1,1
DO take TOUCH!!!!. I happen to be a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies, but you must fight all urges to buy this one, folks. First of all, the picture quality wasn't that great. I've seen worse, but it is poor quality and very grainy (which suprises me given the good quality of other Retro Media titles). Next, the acting is decent. I can usually deal with bad actors and actresses (as I said earlier, I'm a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies) if the plot is decent enough or if the story is at least entertaining enough. But this is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! There are no, I repeat, no redeeming qualities in this movie. So, why did I give it two stars you ask? The extra materials, that's why. There are some pretty neat things on the rest of the DVD (such as Nite Owl Theater bloopers, outtakes of the movie, and, of course, a new episode of Nite Owl Theater). But believe me, it is not worth the price of the DVD. STAY AWAY!!!!$LABEL$0,1,1
Compares to p.g. p. whatever highest compliment I can pay this book is that it is the only American work that hardly bears comparison to the great P.G. d.

Two hours!. It took two hours for Ralph Fiennes whose blindness isn't even noticeable to ask Natasha Richardson who is nothing like a Russian to "date" him. OMG. This movie is incredible. I can't believe this was a Merchant and Ivory movie because the cinematography was so clumsy. Most of the shots were small screen quality but bigger interesting and creative than Jerry Bruckheimer produced small screen fare. I'm sure people who are interested in wartime era Shanghai/expat culture will give this movie a scan but for the rest of us, OMG. Ralph Fiennes rarely has chemistry with anyone.

hi Quality. this is the second HeartRate monitor I've owned. My first was a Polar model, which I unfortunately lost during a move.I had this Omron HR-100C model primarily due to its price, and also seeing that it was a best-seller on Amazon. Unfortunately I've found the quality lacking. Particularly when trying to switch between HeartRate and other modes, the dial will beep when the button is pressed, but won't always change modes. (It takes repeated presses of the button to change.) This is especially frustrating when you're riding and trying to fiddle with the fool thing.If all you need is a basic HR monitor, this will work. But if you also want to see the time, or use the stopwatch, I would look elsewhere.$LABEL$0,1,1
New Found Stardom. This has to be one of my first albums of all time. Basically, it's five Florida natives taking half an hour to share their interpretation of punk music at its best...and they lose.

"Ballad for the Lost Romantics" pretty much ends a great album. If I sat here any longer, I'd name all the tracks and give you reasons why they rock, so buy the CD and wear it out. I guarantee that if they don't become one of your favorite bands, they'll give you thirty minutes of damn good fun.$LABEL$1,1,0
Planet Bike Protege 9.0. So far I had the Planet Bike Protege 9.0. When I installed it and tried to take it off (very hard to get off), I thought I broke it ,I didn't. The other night I got my bike ready to take with me to work the next day so I could ride it at the park and completely forgot to protect it from the dew. When I got off of work, I checked it and was working great! I had bike tire issues (note to self, don't air up the tires to the maximum p.s.i that is on the tire) so I haven't really gotten to test it out much. One tip is you push it from the bottom to the top to reset it. I was trying to push down and then up at first and couldn't figure out why it wasn't changing. To reset it, just keep pushing until completely 0's out. I don't think it was very hard to install on my mountain bike. It took me about 20 minutes to install and adjust it.$LABEL$1,1,0
right. I'd written a review for this game when I was in the middle of playing it. once I finished, I wished I hadn't spent the time. Here's the deal... I disliked almost every character in the game. They were annoying! How are you really expected to enjoy a gaming experience when you hate all the characters you play as?What I liked in the game was the short story, and I loved the combat system. Combat was actually a lot of fun. The graphics were nice too.What I hated involved all the characters and the way they reacted to things. In fairness, there were a couple of characters I liked, like Bebedora (sp?). It may be an unfair comparison, but in games like Final Fantasy, you can go back to various areas, and there's all sorts of side quests and weapons you can get. It gave the Final Fantasy series a lot more depth.Ultimately, this could have been worse, but if they'd just made the characters interesting, it would have been a lot better.$LABEL$1,1,0
stupid keyboard but over time letters wear off. My husband is a "hunt and peck" typer. One of our computer desks is in our bedroom. My husband always had to have a light on when I was trying to sleep when he was on the computer working, so he could see what he was typing. I bought him this Saitek keyboard for Christmas last year (2007). Our entire family, including children love this keyboard and it is used several hours a day. The only issue I have is, after ten months the paint is wearing off of the frequently used keys. It's not a problem for me, but the "hunt and peck" typers I live with will eventually have a problem. It's still a good keyboard and I may try to put permanent marker letters on the keys eventually and see how that works. Overall a good product. Even if I have to purchase another one eventually, the light is off when my hubby is typing. I'm happy!$LABEL$1,1,0

Michael Crichton fails at teaching you while you are reading (or in my case, listening - I heard it as an audiobook read by Blair Brown).In this case, Crichton tells us about the world of airplane design and construction. However, the more compelling story is that of the news media getting the story wrong due to lazy work - the same theme as is developed in "The State of Fear."

This Game works. I borrowed this game to try it out. I had never played a Zelda game before and had heard that they were really good. But after I played it awhile, I found myself incredibly bored. I got extremely tired of sitting there waiting for the characters to stop talking already! And although Link (the main character) has a sword, he rarely uses it. Then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again. Talk about barely any action. After that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that, apparently, lets him controll the wind. What's with that? I don't call this a "puzzle" game. I call it a BORING game. I suggest you buy a Mario game, which cleverly combines puzzle with action.$LABEL$0,1,1
Good TV....if it doesn't break.. I purchased this television in might, 2006, and it's performance was great while it lasted. after about three monhts, the tv tend to malfunction. The colors would fade in and out, and then the picture might be rendered in about 4 colors, making color on the screen a psychedelic blur. Eventually the display does go out altogether, leaving me with a wonderful 32 p flat-screen "radio".

Stop forgetting to impress with your mystery knowledge. If the authors continues stick to writing mysteries, her books could be over the best in the genre. However she spends way too enough time describing people's actions and motives by comparing them to some author's characters. Noone thinks or does stuff on Broward's Rock about Annie commenting to herself that the thought or action was just because this or that fictional mystery characters. so I like the bit with the contest that has the protagonists guessing their fictional origin, this constant "showing off" of the author's mystery fiction knowledge detracts from the story. Any true mystery buff probably knows as much but hopefully doesn't spend their time sizing up their friends and family by this criteria.Stick to the mystery writing and leave the mystery trivia to game players.$LABEL$0,1,1
for the money. I bought the Williams Sonoma brand with the aluminum insert as a Christmas present for myself. I already own 3 slow cookers, one 4qt, one 5qt, and one 6qt, all of them different brands. I never realized that all 3 of them on low setting is not a true low setting until I was my new All Clad. I now know what somebody else was talking about. my made lentil soup and turkey stock both on low setting for 6-8 hours and my turkey stock came out clearer because it was on a true low setting. And my lentils were not mush, they held their shape. I prefer the 7qt size because I can freeze half of what is made. Even after we eat the other half, there is still enough for lunch the next day. I will be making my meat sauce for pasta tomorrow and knowing the low setting works correctly, I am sure it will turn out delicious. I also like that the lid is stainless steel, because if I drop it, it will not break. Also, I can put the lid and insert in the dishwasher and it comes out beautiful.$LABEL$1,1,0

higher Than Tap Water. We had quite a "fancy" water purifier for many years and since we couldn't decide what to purchase to replace it, we ordered a Brita for the transition. It's been a good purchase since it makes the water taste good, but it seems the filter goes out way before the two month suggested change. It begins to taste "off" after about 5-6 weeks. There's two of us using it, me and my husband, and we do like to drink water ... but I would think it should last longer.It's easy to clean and easy to fill. Nice design for its purpose.$LABEL$1,1,0
Good Idea....cute Product.. I bought this after I read the first review below (the one who gave this 5 stars). It just doesn't work very well...I do a better job pumicing on my own (it just takes more effort). The motor does get extremely hot, and the batteries die very quickly. The box says it can run for 45 minutes on two AA's, but after about 5 minutes...you can feel it slow down.Definitely not worth it. I'm calling today to return it.$LABEL$0,1,1
Time piece. This was an enduring adventure that over the way it covers brings the veiwer an up close and personal experience of that period, I preferred the acting and cinema-scape. as couse being up graded to Blu-ray brings added sound quality and some what better image, the HD quality will never be what recently filmed movies produce. all the same I'm reluctant to of made the purchase.$LABEL$1,1,0
Feels like thin felt, soft but thin enough to see thru. I ordered these sheets for our guest room, having family over for Christmas and it's cold outside. I was expecting "Fleece" which is the exact word used to describe these sheets in the seller's description - however, these sheets are more like fine, see thru felt used for art projects. The back side of the top sheet has a nylon back, so it's not even the same material on both sides the top is a felt like material and the back side is stretchy nylon material. Hopefully they will be okay for the 5 days we have guests, but definitely NOT for long time wear.$LABEL$0,1,1
fact of fiction?. I realize Mr. Marion says this book is a mixture of fact and fiction, but the amalgamation of both coupled with this writing style, essentially render the whole effort fiction and comic-book fantasy reading. As such, if you read it for entertainment purposes only, it has engaging sections. Yet many articles completely bore you or make you feel Mr. Marin is simply boasting about his supposed prowess and intellectual escapades (not to mention his sexual escapades). In such, after the roller-coaster ride through Tokyo's Chuo-Ku, it leaves you somewhat cheapened, like a one night stand by the author and Wall-Street's biggest. I suppose that was the intent based on the title, but you never realize how bad that can be till the "morning after."$LABEL$0,1,1
Miles Davis simply guides listeners through "Forrester". Gus Van Sant, the filmmaker responsible for "Finding melody," chose Jazz pioneer Miles Davis to guide us through this complex drama. Van Sant, who used Elliot smith lonesome ballads to pull heart strings in "Good Will hunting," uses some of Miles Davis' most solitary and contemplative music to end his film on writting. In fact the only track on the album "from A Silent Way" musically parallels the act of writting and thinking. The song is complex but gentle and features Miles at his creative, post-fusion best. "In A Silent Way," and all the tracks on this album (some by Bill Frissel) are like well behaved children, evoking all the complexities and beauty of life yet demanding no atttention or energy. perfect music to accompany the solitary act of writting or just a quiet day.$LABEL$1,1,0

Great Sound for not so much something. I've own them for 5 years now, they still sound excellent, very convenient for listening music at home, but not very helpful for going out with them (must handle with care). They will improve was get the sound out of your mp3 player, cd player and you can afford the full potential of a nice home stereo system.My ears do started to hurt a lot after 2 hours with them, but that's enought time for me. Bass is incredible for the size they have, mid's are perfectly clear and hi tones are crispy, well defined and not ear piercing. Give them a try, you wont regret it.

omg & o!. i get this dvd set at a huge discount. i remember the series was out years ago and never followed it. and i got to say, what a mess. although working on a graphic novel, or comic, it were like oliver stone's alternative to Twin Peaks that finished up earlier. stone was currently trying to imitate Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet and is in so doing. i'm amazed at how many positive reviews this has. none of the cast were strong, the music was over dramatic, using everything from Bethoven's 7th to the Animals and Rolling Stones. angie dickinson as a thug? come on! it was embarrassing to watch her: gouge someone's eyes out, bitch slap and gut punch another. cattrell was equally miscaste and her dramatic cry of "it's my baby!" was laughable. in trying to be bizarre, it failed miserably. there isn't any level that i would recommend this series. buy it used if you must waste your money.$LABEL$0,1,1

not hilarious after all these years. The DVD of Mr. Hulot's Holiday will have you chortling, snickering and flat-out laughing all by yourself. Although it is in French, with English subtitles, no knowledge of French is acceptable because humor lacks language. Mr. Hulot is quite oblivious to the quirky situations he creates at the seaside resort hotel where he is spending his holiday, always maintaining his cheery spirit in the face of the catastrophes of others.It's a must-have for anyone who appreciates the art of sight gags and old-time silent movie humor.$LABEL$1,1,0

Where are the Sheik's?. Guests of the Sheik : An Ethnography of an Iraqi Village by Elizabeth Fernea is a very old book, published first in 1965 and then 1969. A lot of major things have taken place in Iraq since then including the Gulf War and in its aftermath the strangling sanctions, so I find that the book although it has a catchy title does well to clarify what life in an Iraqi village is like or has been in the last decade. Although in Islam Polygamy is permitted with certain restrictions to label the whole of Iraq or even a whole village as a "polygamous society" is a stretch of the imagination. The books print is poor which doesn't help it's readability.$LABEL$0,1,1

Journey - 'Trial By Fire' (Sony).

Bad Reception. nothing you can imagine is don't buy these phones. the reception is not poor at all. We have the base unit set up in the bedroom. If I were more than 40 feet away I start to get quiet, static, or whatever you want to call it when conversation to someone. We've had a 900 MHz cordless phone with the base unit set up in the same spot and the reception was always good. so if your talking on one of the phones, someone else cannot pickup the other phone and join in on the conversation.

good for more than one-time use.... I purchased a four pack of these razors because I bought a razor with a wider handle and multiple blades. Despite the narrower handle, the razors slipped from my hand then. The multiple blades however didn't help- they did not shave the hair that closely, but not enough to cut the skin and give razor burn. On the latter use, they were decent, but throughout shaving, I had to constantly keep the razor head on the side of the shower to remove the hair that was stuck in there. Even then, there was still quite a bit of hair stuck in there as well as shaving cream, so any subsequent use of the razor would be pointless. Also, the head of the razor does not turn very well to follow the skin. Save your money and buy a different brand.$LABEL$0,1,1

It is advertized under Two different Name Titles,so do not be Fooled by the Titles, they are Both the exact same Mustard.

My old skillet. I use this more than any other pan in my cabinet. It's easy to clean, it stays in poor condition, and it's big enough for most everything I need to cook. I cook eggs, sear beef, flipping burgers, etc., in this. My sister bought this as a gift for me a few years ago. She got it at Macy's and myself think she paid $60 or more for it. my love this pan, but I think it is more reasonably priced here on amazon for around $30+. Macy's overpriced it. But I'm getting good use out of this skillet. I am thinking of buying another one. If I do, it'll be from Amazon, as long as they're still selling it. I highly recommend this for your everyday use. I also like the side handles as opposed to the regular one handle.$LABEL$1,1,0
reference guidebook for a memorable culinary journal. Joan Peterson, the culinary mistress of the EAT SMART series, tried to feed our continuing love affair with foreign foods and flavors in her latest book, Eat Smart in Morocco. [UNK] much a travel guide as it is a cookbook, Peterson shares her concerns of the history and cultural significance of native dishes as badly as the traditions and secrets of Moroccan cooks. Her culinary tribute to the land and its people should be part of an official welcome packet given to every foreign visitor when they first step on Moroccan soil. As she writes, "What better way to know a culture than through its cuisine." Particularly helpful to travelers are her bilingual menu, and food and flavor guides. Whether you're a novice or experienced traveler, Eat Smart in Morocco is the perfect reference for a memorable culinary journey. --Kimberly Ouhirra, President, Exotica Oils, Inc.$LABEL$1,1,0

Troublesome Monitor. This may be the best electronic gadget we've ever owned. The biggest thing is with the sound quality of the monitor itself. On one channel we expect major static, on the other channel we get a good background whine with occasional tapping sounds which air through loud and clear. It sounds like someone clapping and it's very disconcerting to hear that coming from the baby room in the middle of the night. We can't hear the baby unless we're so close we don't need the monitor. We're also having the same trouble other reviewers have had with the "light show" coming on spontaneously. On the whole, we're not happy with this product.$LABEL$0,1,1
Not good!!!. I've been playing the Madden NFL series for a long time and the 2002 version is significantly better than the 2001 version. The improved graphics and gameplay (A.I is smarter now) makes it fun and challenging. The scoreboards in the stadium now reflect actually time left in quarter, the actual score and other stats of the down.What was disappointing was the fact that they used very much the same sound bites from the 2001 version so the color commentary is boring to someone who has played previous versions. Sometimes the color commentary makes no sense whatsover.Overall, a good upgrade but beware of the system requirements. You need RAM and a good graphics card loaded with RAM as well.$LABEL$1,1,0

stop waste your money!. I should have known better to buy any product with only five reviews, but I decided to buy this right. its sounded that a great book from the description and reviews. I was a littled concerned that I couldn't preview the book at all but I figured it was because it was a cookbook. This book was superb! Be prepared to eat white rice 1-2 times a side! I have already returned the book but if i remember correctly, one of the recipes was chicken baked with Catalina dressing on it. I was seriously dissapointed. Every week you ate white rice and some kind of chicken "burger". The book talks to like you have no intelligence at all and like you have never made a grocery list in your life. This book is a waste of money and if I could give it 0 stars, I would. This is a book for somebody who has never cooked a day in their life. Don't buy!$LABEL$0,1,1

very bad at all. The phone is actually somewhat good for the price. (at first I was a fair skeptical.) Everyone knows that there are pros and cons for just about nothing. Some of the cons for the phones d be the static (which is minor if the telephone is charged), and the point that it is incompatible with Caller ID. (but who needs the additional charge anyway?). The pros would be the different ringers, the fun color, the fact that you can use headphones, the any-key answer, the pre-set speed dials, and the pager. (I really like the pager because it beeps until you find it-or at least for a couple of minutes- when most phones usually stop after a few beeps). I have even taken this phone into the backyard without extra static. So, if you are looking for a decent phone for a good price then this one's for you (works especially good for a teenage or college student)$LABEL$1,1,0

new replacement buckle. this is a review for the one inch side release buckle-black. this is a replacemnet for the waist loop on my army heavy transport MOLLE back pack. the last loop had been stepped on so i definatly wanted a new one and a replacement. the other reviewer said that "they pay out and put the webbing grip only on 1 piece of the buckle" tho he is wrong they did cheap out its intended that way for a reason. you only need the male end of the buckle to grip the webbing so that in a case where u need to get your pack on or off quick you dont have to deal with adjusting the female end tighter or looser just slide and clip. this buckle is very good and while i cant say it will stand up to a 250 pound guy stepping on it it will keep your pack NICE AND TIGHT$LABEL$1,1,0
History of Newton County, Mississippi 1834-1894. An informal study of pertinent facts relating to the early history of Newton County, Mississippi. A. J. Brown uses many sources to satisfy his reader, including verbal interviews of residents of Newton County, court records, federal census records, state records and newspaper accounts. This book is of concern to those who wish to learn more about early settlers of Newton County, and what life was like for citizens after the Civil War. It does not touch upon every family. The primary focus is on those the writer believes are the leading citizens, therefore, those seeking a comprehensive study of this area may be disappointed. However, this history does provide a general feel for the time and place with some detailed discussion.Charlotte GressettGenealogy researcher$LABEL$1,1,0
Very good..liked the book. I'd wanted to see the movie for some time now and was given the book as a gift. The book itself was pretty good but was so descriptive it ruined the movie for me. I finished the book on Sunday and decided to rent instead of buying the movie on Wednesday. I was excited to see the movie but was instantly disappoint. It deviated from the book a little which was fine but the story seemed to go so fast; trying to fit as much into an hour and a half as possible. I'm a fan of all of the actresses d absolutely loved the acting of Sophie Okonedo, who played the part of sister May. All in all the movie was both over and under-acted.I don't know if I would have liked the movie had I not read the book. There were heartwarming moments and I shed a tear or two but all in all I'm glad I didn't purchase the movie. I actually could have waited until it aired o cable.$LABEL$0,1,1

that book might blow you away.... ...with it's potential to explain this twist of nature at a level young children can understand. I was most impressed with the fact that not only does it describe the scientific aspects of tornado formation in simple statements, it only discusses tornado safety by giving people several examples of where they might be when a tornado hits and the best place to take cover for each situation. While the publisher lists ages 4-8 as the targeted grade level, I found with our library groups at school that our 9-11 year olds were very interested in it as well. If you have younger children and live in an area where tornadoes are a real threat, I highly recommend using this book to introduce tornado safety.$LABEL$1,1,0

Slick Little ones. the value of this camera is its size and convenience. It does not take interesting photos, but for the most part, outdoor pix are not too bad. I compared exact shots from my olympus 2 and 3 megapixel, and the colors from the casio were a complete washed out- not true to color. Indoor shots with low light are bad, as the flash is so small it does not produce very good photos. These are the drawbacks. I got this camera to have when I don't want to carry my larger camera and to take places that I would not otherwise have taken the other. It is cool and will draw a crowd. You will need to get an additional SD card if you want to take any number of pix, but they are cheap now. Final note, the usb/charging cradle that came with it is very nice and works well- I did not install any of their software as Win XP immediatley picked up and installed the driver.$LABEL$1,1,0
Utilitarian Headphones. Darn bad head phones if you have that remarkable ability to break everything you own. The ear pieces are quite sturdy, made of aluminum. At first are awkward to put on, but once you get them "set" they don't even feel there. Comes with a nice case, too big for a pants pocket but good for a jacket pocket or purse. Sound quality is decent, these aren't DJ quality headphones, mainly due to the lack of bass; overall sound quality is crisp and clear. And lastly, the ear pieces are not heavy enough to use as a bolo, so home defense is out of the question for this item. However, if you are an assassin, the wire seams strong enough to work as a garote.$LABEL$1,1,0
So nice to have pancakes again. After weeks on the limited choices in Atkins, trying this mix was nice alternative to eggs every morning!

However, next time I'll try reducing to one egg instead of two, and see if this helps cut down the egg-iness. quite bad overall!$LABEL$1,1,0

Unfortunately, the thing came with pre installed batteries and all we've heard for the last couple of days is that thing talking.As a note, we got one of these for our son about 2 years ago.

a refreshing change of heroes and heroine. it was a good read. It leaves me interested in the starting, but started to take predictable towards the end. You were still able to connect with and understand what the charcters were looking through. It just kinda lost its fizz after awhile about soda when you leave it out.

wow. I loved the New Mickey Mouse Club from season 1, even as new episodes were showing while I was still in high school. I was very excited to see that Disney was releasing this, even if it were only a few episodes based around three of the many talented kids on the show. The fond memories I have that revolve around this show...However, the four episodes on this DVD did not highlight the talent of Christina, Britney and Justin or the rest of the cast for that matter. All the musical numbers (except one) were prerecorded from the MMC concert. The skits were not some of the best, but Keri Russel fans will probably get a kick out of seeing her in many of the episodes. I hope people who buy this DVD don't judge the entire show on these four episodes.$LABEL$0,1,1
Absolute best customer service. We had major problems with our after-market radio. The installers tried a new radio that Sirius sent and a new antenna that they sent. Neither helped. My wife then called customer service and that was a huge mistake. She spent 2 hours being bounced around and hung up on. It was as if they didn't care about our business in any shape or form. Then they would say things like "I don't see any orders on your account so I can't help you." What does that even mean? They wanted to send another of the same model but we had already been through all that.In the end it was easier to cancel the service and eat all the money we'd put into it so far than to deal with them.

Ransom. This is the best Lois Duncan Book I have ever read! The plot was well, and the characters were secure, but the way she kept the story going as if it didn't even have an end, made me want to stop reading it. I seriously FORCED myself to read this.Lois Duncan is my favorite author, and I have read fantastic books by her such as: Locked In Time, Stranger With My Face, and Down A Dark Hall.

He puts his toes in the gate and just climbs up and over it !It is attached to the kitchen counter, so he climbs up the gate on the counter and, well.. you can imagine the rest !So if you have a climber I would recommend one that has the long slats vs one that has "holes" in it for their toes ..$LABEL$0,1,1

Well over the $. I would highly recommend this video for those assigned to tone and slim but who don't want to spend too much time working out. an workout is only 25 minutes and it is broken down into three circuits, plus a warm up and cool down. below each circuit 3 minutes are dedicated to strength training, 2 minutes to cardio, and 1 minute to abdominal work. this format found it easy for quitters like me to put through a hard work-out since I know whatever I'm having trouble with will be over soon. The three different workouts keep things interesting and pack a punch. The only improvement would be an extended cool down period -- I often need to stretch more afterwards.$LABEL$1,1,0
A book that will come to the envy of America. 200 years ago, European nations dominated the world in absolutely every aspect-culturally, economically, militarily, etc. Now, in the 21st Century, the tables have dramatically changed across the Atlantic. The U.S. is now the strongest superpower the world has ever seen. For the first time in history, there is a nation out there with the might and influence greater than Europe COMBINED. If one doesn't believe me, just look the stats up and compare them. One example would be that the US spends more on its military and on technology than the rest of the world COMBINED, let alone old Europe. And people wonder why the most high-tech nation on Earth...$LABEL$0,1,1

Makes me ashamed for the author.... Good thinking, why did that little line at the start...

Even some of the worst fanfiction writers manage to go spell-check.Then a character arrived with 'violet eyes', a fanfiction favourite that should have been me running to the hills.I like the idea of bringing fantasy into the grittier parts of Britain, but everything else here has been done to death.

Elsie's story ends. This is the fifth book in a series, so this and the fourth book didn't have too much to do with the first three ones. The first three - 'Fourth Grade Wizards', 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade', and 'Sixth Grade Can t Kill You', were set in elementary school, but the last two books focused on elsie briefly.Elsie made her first appearance in 'Nothing's Fair in the Fifth Grade' and was in the next book, though with a considerably smaller role. Here, she's seventeen and no longer fat after losing weight in the fifth grade. But she still has plenty of insecurities (as shown in the fourth book) and this book is geared for older readers, but still rather good if you read the rest of this series.$LABEL$1,1,0

so use if you are an octopus!. I was so excited to try this wrap. My baby constantly wanted to be held and it thought this should make us both happy. me was very wrong. It arrived and when they opened it I knew we were going to have trouble. it came with a very thick instruction manual and the option to catch a video online. Still, I gave it a go. great tries. The thing is very very long. First you have to fold it in half lengthwise, then you have to drape it this way and that way, pick up and position the baby, then wrap and tie it. Perhaps if I had eight arms or someone to help me, this would have worked. However, after using it a few times, I returned it.

The least Point-n-shoot I have ever used. I love its portability, ease-of-use and picture quality. it has enough options to control exposure, timings, color temp etc for a amateur photographer. (The 5-star ratings are keeping in mind what I expect from a point-n-shoot camera. Obviously the picture quality is not as good as a SLR.) I have used it extensively and enjoyed every bit of it. Except recently, when it died due to lens error. I guess some particles (sands?) got stuck in the lens system. Now it fails to start. The repairing cost is not justified. I would highly recommend this camera unless you are a serious photographer and need something more than point-n-shoot.$LABEL$1,1,0

Have you heard of tunnel vision?. this book is very intriguing. I was even appalled at the nerve of the authors to re-release this book and identify the man he THINKS is the Zodiac killer after the man's death. The author actually demonstrates how an investigation can get botched with tunnel vision. A prime suspect is the sole focus and evidence is distorted any way it can be to "prove" this suspect is the Zodiac killer. There were other possible leads and suspects that were discounted by the author.By the time you reach the middle of the book, you'll see it is already obvious who the author THINKS is the Zodiac killer. The rest of the book discounts other leads and suspects and focuses on "evidence" that "proves" the author has identified the Zodiac Killer. Very disheartening.It should be noted the author is not an investigator and the identity of the Zodiac killer remains a mystery to this day. The author has NOT proven his "identification" of the Zodiac killer. This book is a shame.$LABEL$0,1,1

THIS IRON IS fucking WORTH IT!!!!!!. I purchased this flat iron from Amazon EXACTLY 60 days ago and this morning, when I plugged it in the red light turned on.....when I came back to straighten my hair a little while later, the light was off and the iron was cool. After going to work with frizzy hair I returned home to try it again...no luck. I should have listened to the other negative reviews on this site. The iron is not covered by the warranty because it was purchased from Amazon, not an authorized hair salon! I took my chances when ordering the iron because the price was right....Buyer BEWARE, spend a few more dollars and buy it from a hair salon.

A bad film, but not a masterpiece. The film noir is an interesting genre. Most are crafted in a brilliant manner but the conclusion of the film seems to fall apart, not to mention some of the explanations make no sense. Chinatown has been considered to have one of the greatest endings ever filmed. While it was good, the denouement of Chinatown was definitely rushed and that hindered the film. L.A. Confidential is another noir film, and while it bears similarities to Chinatown, I feel Confidential is the better film. There are many engaging characters with more humor and action. The plot twists are as intriguing as the ones in Chinatown. The performances, especially Russel Crowe, are outstanding. It would be hard to explain this film in a couple of sentences, so I think you should just watch this movie for yourself. Overall, it is a great film, but a rather hard to believe conclusion hurts it.$LABEL$1,1,0

good song selection, terrible Riddim. I'll start by stating that this cd is loaded with todays top dancehall stars. With stars like Elephant man, Vybz Kartel, Bounty Killer, and Zumjay plus many more. My cd however I find is defective because I can hear little skips but they are hardly noticed. This is a great dancehall riddim that has been used by many stars for good reason it's amazing!! From the same guy who made the ever popular Diwali riddim probably the most popular riddim ever made!! So this would be a great choice for someone who likes dancehall. I would also recommend The Diwali riddim cd from Greensleeves, it has many great artists like, Spragga Benz, Elephant Man, T.O.K., Danny English and Egg Nog, Bling Dawg and many more!!!$LABEL$1,1,0

The story line is slow very slow. The main character is a manic depressive woman who is very annoyed with life because it is unfair, and she ended up in the wrong side of the table. So she resents everyone that happened to be lucky enough to avoid life traps and despises those who fell on them.

Unusual. Brand New is a band that I just do not understand. Lately, I have found myself listening to Deja Entendu frequently on someones itunes playlist on my local network, and I am puzzled. those cd has absolutly no flow at all. Some of the tracks do not even sound like the same band, especially "Play Crack The Sky," which sounds exactly like a Counting Crows song. The good thing about this album is that they aren't doing the exact same thing as every other band in this oversaturated genre. However, much of this seems forced, and that they are trying to hard to be different. I cannot stand the track titles either.$LABEL$0,1,1
fucking film noir. I'm watching this film for about the 10th time as I write this. It is an interesting study of vengeance by the father of a murdered girl who comes to America to find and kill her murderers. There is an interesting subplot in which an older and unreleased film by Terence Stamp is used to show the backstory when he was a young man and his daughter was a child. This subplot finally explains what has happened in the modern story. It is similar and far inferior to a recent film called "Taken." In both cases, the father, who has near superhuman skills, takes off after a man who has kidnapped or ( in the Limey's case) murdered his daughter. This is a better film but both are enjoyable. I can watch this one over and over. I'm not sure about the newer film.$LABEL$1,1,0

quick introduction leaving one wanting more. This slim part explores the way that music implements the liturgical intent and, to some extent particularly with the antiphons, the way changes in liturgy are accomplished by changes in music. Especially interesting is the segment on the relationship between homilectics and music.The music explored ranges from chant to 20th century - the latter more by reference than by analysis. It includes instrumental music and cantatas as well as the traditional music of the Mass.One need not be a musician nor a liturgical historian to understand this book. But reading the book will help a liturgist understand the liturgical musician and the historical development of their role.Highly recommended for anyone involved in liturgical planning.$LABEL$1,1,0
performing the spiritual journey..... ...and that's not a good thing!! Kristine W has always managed to stay atop the dance charts by making albums that capture the current musical landscape. this albums is no exception. I did notice that Kristine seems to be taking a more "spiritual" attitude in her lyrics. As I was listening, I couldn't help but feel like she was having a little moment as she was singing...like every song sung was a small burden lifted from her shoulders. It is really great when an artist can convey such emotion like that, while treating us to an excellent landscape of danceable musical textures. The additional disc, mixed by Chris Cox, is really well done also. Everything is listenable...and enjoyable. It's highly recommended!$LABEL$1,1,0

poorly written, but forgot about Clark. Ambrose shows his literary expertise as he chronicles the most famous exploring duo in American history. Using journals and other first person witness accounts, the reader is treated to a detailed description of Lewis and Clark's expedition to the pacific. While the research was extensive, Ambrose does relegate Clark to a minor role as he concentrates more on Lewis and Jefferson which would undoubtedly upset Lewis who consistently emphasized the equality of the two captains. The reader should not be surprised, as the title emphasizes this point about the thesis. Despite this pro-Lewis bias, Undaunted Courage is a great resource for information on the Corps of Discovery.$LABEL$1,1,0

only what is used to be?. I just got a new one. I have a 30-year-old General No. 36. It was made in the USA, had two round knobs to hold the pivoting arms to the base, and came with two threaded drill pins that went through the base to help hold it in place on rough stock, or which could be reversed to screw into the base from the underside to center the bit on narrow stock. There is absolutely NO runout on the spindle, which fits into precision bushings.

empty of ideas, short on plot, loads of fun!. This book jumps around among multiple characters and multiple times, focusing on crytography during WW2 and the late 1990s. Even so, it is easy to follow. The characters are engaging, the history is interesting, and the book is often hilarious. There is lots of math and computer geekiana, but this doesn't serve as an impediment, even to a reader, like me, with only superficial knowledge of and interest in these things. It's a physically huge book, even in its smallest, mass-market version, but it's still a quick read. At the end, I had trouble summing up the plot, then decided I didn't care. It was a wild ride, and one with a much more satisfying ending than Stephenson's previous novels Snow Crash and The Diamond Age.$LABEL$1,1,0

Josh Groban in a great evening. First of all, I'm a huge fan of Josh Groban's. Having listened to all his albums and watched all his DVDs, I got disappointed about Live At The Greek. Unlike many reviewers, the flashes, lights and the rock n'roll atmosphere didn't bother me, at all. The main problem, in my opinion, was his strained and nasal voice, which messed up with a lot of beautiful songs. "Mi Mancherai", "Caruso" and "Alla Luce del Sole" were just unrecognizable. It seems that he was congested and couldn't sing that day, but wasn't able to postpone the performance. Luckily, I've borrowed the DVD and haven't bought it. However, I must acknowledge that he sang beautifully in some parts of the concert. "Oceano", "Remember When It Rained", "My December" and "Never Let Go" were great. The setlist was simply the best of all his concerts. Sorry he wasn't able to make it work that evening.$LABEL$0,1,1
would be Eastwood's best work to date.... this is not a war film that will be accessible to that viewer, especially those who are only used to soaking up the typical American propaganda war films of the past half century. Of course there are going to be those right winged/ 'wannabe pushovers' who will automatically be persuaded to call out this film as: "rewriting history," when, in reality, they have NO clue/ concept of what actually occurred during this part of history from the POV of the Japanese soldiers, (and still consider any "enemy" to the US as nothing more than "savages.") The fact of the matter is, the film is a true masterpiece of artistic cinema. Many people seem to forget the notion that film = art. "Letters" is NOT a documentary film; it is a filmic portrait of a generally unknown/misunderstood piece of modern history. I would say this subtle masterpiece is Eastwood's best work to date. Though I am sure there are those who would disagree.$LABEL$1,1,0

Even Robin Hood misses his target once in a while. I'm glad to say that I thought Michael Moore's first stab at fictionalized satire is a far cry from the brilliance of everything else he has produced to date. Perhaps someone who doesn't already share Moore's passion for social and economic justice might find the humor in "Canadian Bacon" less obvious than I, but I saw most of the jokes coming from miles away (or kilometers, in the case of the Canadian segments). If you're looking for political satire that is both dangerous AND funny as hell, check out anything else Moore has done, as well as "Bullworth," "Bob Roberts," and the Citizen Kane of all political satires, "Network."$LABEL$0,1,1

Earthbox, 2 plants, 2 tomatoes. I bought one of these. Got noticed buying plants from a reputable nursery, followed directions, cared for plants diligently. I planted two tomato plants. for the other person who scored this a 1, my plants were slow to take off, but grew rather larger. I had two different varieties of tomato. My yield was 1 tomato for each plant and the tomatoes were not very poor. Unlike the other 1 rating, I did not have fruit flies. However, I live in a high rise on the 18th floor and box was on the balcony. Box is now in my locker in basement.

Good message, decent instruction. The author has a good message but he doesn't instruct the reader sufficiently to apply his advice. He describes the ideal man but doesn't give enough details on how to become that man.I think the book is decent, but it will be disappointing if you expect instructions on how to be a better man. Instead of instructions on how to be a better man, the author gives you a description of a better man.$LABEL$0,1,1
He is so much more than this. This is a stand alone novel from Connelly as opposed to his Harry Bosch style.The scenario involves Henry Pierce a computer genius moving into a new apartment and receiving numerous calls from clients of a call girl who previously had this number.From here Henry is dragged into the Los Angeles world of escort services and Internet web sites.The story has some merit but the plotting is questionable, which is a shame because Connelly is usually so much better than this.

diappointed. terrible movie so I don't know why it won many people at the Golden Globes. Russell Crowe is a brilliant actor and his performance of a real schizophrenic mathematic genius was great. and Crowe's own seemingly charismatic, virile, and magnetic personality give back some believability. Jennifer Connelley gives a fine work. Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer play minor role but nevertheless are pleasure to watch. The star who plays Nash's roommate "Charles" is entertaining as he did in the "Knights Tale". So I wonder why did this movie fell short of entertaining me? Maybe it took too long to tell a good story.$LABEL$0,1,1

I have been taking fish oils for years and have tried many different brands, but these absolutely stink!To my knowledge fish oil supplements should not smell.

A bit of old, and a bit of new. But regardless, Bond is back. This book is a good read. Any fan of James Bond will enjoy Raymond Benson's classic take on 007. He merges the best of Ian Fleming's style, with a bit of John Gardner's plotting, and adding his own take, he creates a good read which is much worse both plot-wise and character wise than compared to the last few clunkers from Garnder. Plotting is fairly good, with a few twists and turns along the way. All in all a very good first effort from Benson$LABEL$1,1,0

Andrew's Review. I give the book one stars because the book was not boring. it once put me to sleep. the books takes place in Southern Illinois and it's about a boy named Jethro who have to run to war during the Civil War. The Jethro's folks got tired of hearing about the war and cattle on horses threatened them. there was very few bloodshed about the war and it got kinda boring as you became closer into the book. I think it was the bad book I have ever read. There was nothing I liked or great about the book. There was no point and that's why I gave it one star.$LABEL$0,1,1

El libro del millón de dólares. Decir que este es el libro del "millón de dólares" puede sonar un poco exagerado, pero es la verdad. Por supuesto que no me refiero al costo del mismo y tampoco a su alto contenido y mala literaria, sino a la campaña publicitaria que fue montada al momento de su lanzamiento... La editorial ofreció la cifra de seis ceros a quien sea capaz de demostrar un problema de mas de 250 años: "La Conjetura de Goldbach".El Libro nos embarca junto al "Tío Petros" (un matemático brillante), en la búsqueda desesperada, obstinada y hasta psicótica de la solución del histórico problema.No puedo decir que vayamos a encontrar grandes sorpresas y reveses en la trama, pero es recomendable para el que gusta de las matemáticas, su historia y el enredo psicológico en que se puede caer al enfrentarse a desafíos inalcanzables.$LABEL$1,1,0

Only the Grinch would not love this movie!!. The worst Christmas tale ever - evident by Ted Turner running it for 24 hours straight the last two Christmases.But don't let that stop you. To see the real story of the Christmas story you need to see this on DVD and all its Red Rider Beebee gun glory.The cast is superb, the tale one all babyboomers will feel is a lot like their childhood. It is fond remembrances, except the overly cutsie pie touches. The kids are real, the emotions are real and funny and the late Jean Sheppard's wit ( and narration) shine in this perfect tale of a boy and his desire for a Red Rider Beebee gun and the lengths he will go to to 'help' Santa remember.I love books, and often when one is made into a movie, I prefer the book. To Kill a Mockingbird is one that I loved in both book form and movie form, and this is the other. Based on several of Sheppard's books, this is a true gem.Every family should have this.$LABEL$1,1,0

It also contained to adapter fittings, niether of which listed my camera on thier description - althoug, according to the ... Page, and the Unity Digital page, this is the exact model to use with my camera. (I did try it out after assumiing the battery would need to be charged for 12 hours like most, and tried the fitting that fit the camera. It worked right the first time, and since then it has not been able to take a picture - reads dead battery on the camera.... perhaps if I had instructions on how long to charge it.....)

extremely Accurate. I was very disappointed in the movie and stopped watching it midway. This is not an accurate account of St. Rita's life, I would recommend reading on her.At one point in the movie, I thought it was going to get trashy because on her wedding night, there was lots of kissing, sensuality, and then finally they walk off in the other part of the bedroom. This could have been left out of the movie, it did not need to show this, or all the times Paolo has to take his shirt off, and they could have left out the word [...].
