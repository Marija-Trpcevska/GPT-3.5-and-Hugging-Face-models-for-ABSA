very bad at all.... I was not really sure how this movie was going to play, but it is a thriller and it did keep me on the edge of my seat --- I would probably even watch it a second time --- that's saying a lot for me.BUT, do yourself a favor and buy it used on amazon marketplace or rent it...$LABEL$1,1,0
The Wolf s. Well being that I'm from a rather rough part of Wisconsin. My gang resides in the grimiest trailer park eva. Before heaven sent us the worst tshirt. My gang was the 11th most rowdy gang in the trailer park. Since then we jumped straight up to number 2. Being that the number one gang actually has real wolfs named Kito and Keloy that they raised since baby wolfs. Tshirts is second worst.Be aware of knock offs. To ensure authenticity the shirt should fade to grey in just 1 wash! I don't know why they just didn't make the shirt in grey like wolfs colors. To get maximum dudage I recommend cutting off the sleeves, don't worry the value of the shirt will not go down by doing this, but is will increase your Poon level. [...] I even had this one 11 year olds father give me and his daughter tickets to a Miley Sirus concert in trade to wear my 3 wolfs t shirt for the night. [...] Oh well, I got to see Miley!$LABEL$1,1,0
The least book I have ever read. Having a Minor in Lit, I have read handful of books. Having purchased many, many books, myself have still felt the desire to write a scathing review of a book. I loved this man.If you HATE animals or hear some weird enjoyment over the gross abuse of animals this is the book for you. Once that understanding of the book began to develop, I really could care less about why this woman kills herself. I could go on and on but this book is not worth the effort.$LABEL$0,1,1
Jim Morrison ....heard again...by Bruce Botnick. I am wondering who let John Densmore take these tracks? Morrison's vocals are almost left off...they are so reduced in this new era...just horrible..and the drums are now the lead instrument...just dreadful. this wonderful selection of tracks...reMASTERING would be more but reMixed? WHY? and if so..why didn't anybody mention that Jim's voice was the defining instrument of the band...when he died...so did the band. Don't get me wrong I admire Robby and Ray...but without Jim they didn't go anywhere and why he is diminished in these new mixes is just a crime.$LABEL$0,1,1
A lot unrealistic but okay. Very quick reading, I was 3/4 of the thing through and felt I had just started reading it. Tim LaHaye always does a great amount of developing characters and situations. This story was based on actual heart breaking events that take place today. I want unrealistic because of how it all works out but convinced that God is able to do all things. I loved the twist at the end of the book. Overall, more Christian fictional reading.$LABEL$1,1,0
cute but properly made. Aesthetically, this umbrella is just fine, and still looks good after 3 months of use so far. My problems with it: 1) The picture makes it look like a base comes with it. Nope- you have to purchase one separately, and there's no guidance on which type to get. Don't get the Verdi Gras cast iron stand, this umbrella is too thin to fit properly into it. So it leans a bit to the left. Not a huge deal.2) Whenever I crank it closed, it somehow manages to pinch and cut my hand, even if I'm trying to be careful3) If you're dumb enough, like me, to leave it open on a windy day, it blows over, taking your table and umbrella stand with it.$LABEL$0,1,1

great Impression. When the uncut version was shown on television a few months ago,they advertised the video would be the same as the uncut version shown on television. I played the first video and it is the same as the original movie without the uncut scenes.

worst Rush Album Yet. This is my second review. My first one was over 8 months ago. I just want to say that Vapor Trails has become my favorite Rush album (which by default makes it my favorite album). It would have been inconceivable to me that Rush could do better than Moving Pictures, Hemispheres or Fairwell to Kings. Hold Your Fire was the the last really great Rush album for me (although I do like all the ones that followed except maybe Presto). Vapor Trails has turned it all around again. I just hope they keep releasing albums. Anyone that can't hear the genius in this album just hasn't given it a chance. Play the full album 10 times and then decide.$LABEL$1,1,0
absolutely worth it. I originally bought this because I have an older ipod which had poor battery life, otherwise this player was not worth the money. I bought it because it was one of the few smaller players that was compatible with mac, but many times when I transfer the songs from my computer to the player they do not transfer. This can be very frustrating, and takes up a lot of unnecessary time.$LABEL$0,1,1
Bought 2, both are completed within a week. My dogs barking seemed to decrease within a few uses of this product, hence why after the first one broke after only a week I ordered a replacement. The first one sprayed the Citronella as soon as it was refilled, even when on the off button, and the second one we used for one day, I went to refill it, and none happened when I blew on it to test it. I exchanged the battery just in case, used a different refill bottle, and nothing! One week for the first, 1 day for the second!!!!! Our dog is a 2.5 lb Maltese kept inside, so it's not excessive wear or water damage. Poor quality! Great potential!$LABEL$0,1,1

Carol is that great singer, we have been looking for. Carol Sloane really knows how to sing JAZZ. She seems to be a natural at this venue. Her voice is really smooth and nice to listen to.For this project Carol used Bill Charlap as pianist and arranger. I must say Bill did a good job wearing both hats. Also Carol has a lot of fine sidemen that contributed to this cd. I think we need to give the musicians for this project a hand of applause.The down side to this cd was that some of the arrangements I didn't like and feel that they worked very well. All and all I would say this was a worth while cd.Recommendation: I would like to recommend this cd.$LABEL$0,1,1
I've been guzzling this stuff for years, perfect tasting shakes with good blend of essentials. Does it taste like a great milkshake? No, but it is very bad. I usually mix it with 8oz milk, about 3oz water and 3oz ice. It makes a more liquidy shake that is much difficult to drink. I think the recommended mixture makes it a bit too thick. Taste is a good vanilla flavor and there is very little aftertaste other than the sweetener used. Its definitely filling and works well post workout.$LABEL$1,1,0

The Last Fairy Tale of Fantasy from the Vietnam War. This well written, but severely researched fantasy piece should have been labeled as a novel in my opinion. Ten POWS died of starvation, mistreatment, and torture in Garwood's camp; none of them crossed over to the enemy. To know the real Bobby Garwood, read Frank Anton's "Why Didn't You Get Me Out?" or Zalin Grant's "Survivors," plus several more POW narratives that are out of print but still may be found at major libraries. If you are still inclined to believe the best in Garwood, look up his name or "Garwood Papers" on the POW/MIA Database on the Library of Congress's website, and you'll discover a ton of material that will change your mind$LABEL$0,1,1
YET remains GREAT METAL BAND GONE SOFT. Ok don't get me wrong i love SEVENDUST and there is nothing wrong with mellow metal BUT!!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot wait until a group will come out and not change their music style. i'm so sick of these bands drawing fans in with one type of music then going soft hmm hmm(creed,staind) just to name a couple others. I guess not all bands can be like OVERKILL who will never change their style for anything. I call it going from great to mediocre but then again the world is ruled by mediocracy uh? But anyway if you are a big SEVENDUST fan pick it up. If your a "rock" fan pick it up. If your a true to life metal fan (OVERKILL, TESTAMENT, SLAYER, JUDAS PRIEST) stay clear!!!!!!!!$LABEL$0,1,1
must finish it. I read every day, so does my nine year old, and we often read to each other. 10 page into me reading this one, and we gazed each other in the eye and made faces. I can recall the last time we didn't finish a book. Too many long periods of colors matched with birds we hadn't knows of (and we have almost memorized David Attenborough's world of Birds, and my son does a bunch show birds calls from those videos). The illustrations were nice drawings, but honestly, the rain forest is best taught with a visual component. Or perhaps with much better writing.$LABEL$0,1,1

Good story contains glaring flaws. For sheer escapist adventure of the romantic variety, this book is a winner. There's quite a bit of anachronism in dialogue and character behavior, and those who are familiar with Spanish ll be put off by abysmal usage of that language (misspellings like "buenas dias" and "bandeleros" stand out -- repeatedly). Horsey terms, too, take an occasional hit ("gruello"?). Some of the plot points require extreme suspension of disbelief. The story is so delightfully told, though, that I was more than willing to suspend my internal editor and just read for the fun of it.$LABEL$1,1,0

preaching to the Choir: writings for Evangelicals. I downloaded this because it was free. From the title, who knew it was an expose of Mormonism. It is, but only as contrasted to the author's original Christian faith. As a secularist, I hear things shocking about the mainstream Mormon church--just some weird Masonic-like stuff and silly old men. the author happens to have joined for the social aspects and then quit when it turned out to be hard. I slogged through the first half. The second half, which describes the author's ministry, I skimmed. This book obviously appeals to those who share Ms. Robertson's beliefs, but just seemed like propaganda to me.$LABEL$0,1,1

workout. My husband and I used this for the last time tonight. We had a huge venison roast and put it through the grinder very easily. Although, I could definitely see how a motor would simplify matters, we still went through it in less than an hour (which includes cleaning it up post-grinding, and taking care of our cranky children). I would recommend this to nobody. This one hasn't been as impressive as some motored ones I have been around, but it did the job efficiently, was easy to clean, and didn't get my kitchen messy with "goo" everywhere. You will want a workbench or something similar to bolt it down on.- One complaint, the packaging we received the grinder in was horrible. I am almost surprised we even got it because of the box being in such bad shape. Also, no manual included and the handle didn't survive the transit, so my husband had to make one. These aren't devastating factors, but are annoying.$LABEL$1,1,0
Could be a good book... just don't try to do the practice problems.. Why the $%&* while you list a homework problem under section 4.4 when you wouldn't know how to do it without reading section 4.5? This has rounded off my whole study strategy that has served me extremely well in every science class (physics, math, chemistry) I've taken up to this point, college or high school. Basically, you read a section, and then do the practice problems for that section BEFORE moving onto the next. I just wasted 2 hours of valuable finals study time reading sections 1.1 through 4.4 looking for the solution, only to turn 2 pages ahead after giving up to find the necessary information right there... words cannot express how enraged I was after discovering this and I hope this review will save some others from lighting their book on fire and throwing it out the window like I almost just did.$LABEL$0,1,1
In flight confusion. This is by far the better language-related product I have ever purchased. This CD assumes that you can learn a language by memorizing long, complicated phrases by rote with no foundation whatsoever in vocabulary or grammar. It is just not possible to remember long setences relating to travel without first learning anything about the basic grammar of a language. The phrases aren't even repeated or broken down. This CD might be useful if you have already taken some modern Greek and want to brush up on travel phrases. Otherwise save your money -- most Greeks who work in airports and hotels speak English and this CD won't help you have much of a conversation with anyone who doesn't.$LABEL$0,1,1
not disappointed in KS. I am halfway through this books and not enjoying it as they have all of her others I have read. I decided to come on Amazon to see what any other comments were about this book. I was, and have decided to given up on this one and go on to another one of hers. I just found this one very much to follow and I don't like having to worked that hard trying to keep up with a story line.

A knife is of no matter if...... I will just echo much of what "The Shepard" said about the knife. It's almost nice to remove it from the sheath without playing tug of war with yourself.

Sadly, these bars have a distinct flavour that is off-putting and really makes them better than wonderful in my eyes. The outer shell smells and tastes like a wheat tortilla. I'm not convinced.

It sounded so good on the back cover.... I first read this book over three years ago and didn't like it. But then, a few weeks ago, I decided to see how much my taste in books had matured and gave it another chance. Big mistake! I enjoy this book! They took a wonderful concept and blew it to smithereens by ruining Giles and Xander. I would have felt better if they'd somehow discovered that the real Giles and Xander had been locked in a warehouse for the duration of this novel and had been replaced by cyborgs because only that could explain why the heck they were saying such stupid stuff!Not only were they horrible, but the supposed climax of the novel - the zombie diner fight scene - was over waaay too fast and easily. It completely and irreparably damaged my spirit. The books only saving grace was some fun quips from the Buffster and a sweet (albeit, paranormal) kiss between Willow and Xander at the very end. I would recommend Coyote Moon and Halloween Rain in a heartbeat over this book.$LABEL$0,1,1

Buy, Capitalist!. With most bands, you only get one version of a specific song. Occasionally, extended mixes, remixes, live or demos show up.

This is Manson's best album yet!. This is Manson's worst album yet. Unlike Antichrist Superstar he sings about things that affect all of us. He constantly is reminding us that drugs do run our society. "The Dope Show" is the best song on the album. But the others are not far behind. In his past albums Manson constantly screamed his lyrics. This happens only a few times in "Mechanical Animals". I particulary like the song that has a 70's sound and backup singers. If you are looking for variety from one artist, Marilyn Manson is your man? woman? mannequin? Who knows and who cares!$LABEL$1,1,0

Lugubrious..... A very engaging book with a very interesting setting. The portrait of the bleak aftermath of wwii in Berlin is excellent but the narration is drawn out much longer than necessary.

A nice primer on nonduality. If you've seen "What the [bleep]" and found it revelatory, you sure find this book moderately useful/interesting.Otherwise, particularly if you've ever reading any book about Eastern philosophy/spirituality, you're liable to find this a very dull, repetitive, dry, and uninformative read.he can sums it up as follows: "Aristotle - bad! Nagarjuna - good! Non-duality, token reference to Buddha/Jesus/Eastern mystic, unintentionally reductionistic reference to quantum physics or psychic research, blah blah blah, endnote."The authors are presumably quite nice people and I hope my viewpoint doesn't cause them any unnecessary suffering...but they should really stick to academia rather than mainstream publication.$LABEL$0,1,1
Comprehensive View. while in her book on Instinctual Subtypes, Ms. Chernick-Fauvre, has provided the reader with the added visceral dimension of learning by a dry portrait of each subtype.

An experienced look. I tried not to be overly objective and I also tried to be open to the contents of this book, I still enjoy some things very hard to swallow. I have not yet fully completed my reading, but I will tell you this...Satanism is not a mental disease. The mental disease area belongs to those who think as this book reads. I have been a Satanist my entire adult life. But to tell me that I have a mental disease not a relgion is just the same as saying that all Christians and Catholics are diseased. If you do read this book, just remember...those who write about what they do not know spead a sead of misinformation and seads of the brain if used unwisley can be very distructive.

everything Original. I own every domestic Esbjorn Svensson Trio album and this is the first one to disappoint me. With each of their other albums there are tunes that are truly unique in composition, sounds and performance. However, this album is missing that innovation. To me, this album sounds like it was made by taking a handful of older, mediocre EST songs, dropping them in a blender and mastering what comes out. It sounds superb. The songs also aren't differentiated from each other, so it's not very noticeable when one song ends and another begins.$LABEL$0,1,1

stupid tool...but beware if you are a traveling engineer. I purchased the Cybertool because I am a traveling engineer and find that I need to open computer and networking equipment a lot when I'm on the road. The tool is great and very handy. I have only one complaint about the Cybertool...since I travel every week, I will not check bags (playing the odds by checking bags every week will definitely result in lost luggage many times a year) and the Cybertool will not pass through TSA security checkpoints. This makes the Cybertool useless for me. It would be nice if the Cybertool and all other Swiss Army knife models were listed in a matrix that showed which ones can be checked according to TSA security rules. This seems like it would be an easy task...perhaps that is a project I can work on sometime unless it already exists out there.$LABEL$1,1,0
A variety of bad & bad. If you can overlook some of the lamer episode and just focus on the more plot-hole oriented episodes, you should find it interesting.Yes, one of the episodes is 'darker' in nature. Ponies are captured by dragons and turned into dragons by a centaur who keeps a throbbing 'dark' rainbow in a bag upon his neck. Seeing the ponies in chains is sad, but not scary. mine nieces & nephew (4, 6, & 8) LOVED this episode most of all and even began singing along with the seaponies halfway through the song!The rest of the episodes are all about friendship, helping one another, and saving the day.

Nice music - fine SOUND !!!. There is not much I can say about Mike Rowland music. Simple melodic piano tunes with synthesizer strings. I like it and it's the reason I bought it.I originally had bought the "Fairy Ring" on tape, and quite recently I decided to buy it on CD too, to enjoy it on my just bought, multi $$$ thousand stereo system. The man who remastered the recording however (if anyone did at all), must have been deaf. The CD sounds as bad as(if not worse than) my worn-out tape cassete. I was thinking of buying "Titania" too on CD, but I probably won't after that. That's too bad for the music cause I honestly think it's worth it. I hope the "Fairy Ring Suite" sounds better.$LABEL$0,1,1

I am stunned with the design. This device concept is excellent. However, the designers could have made it easier to clean when mold began to harden! Yes, mold grew even though we used bottled/purified waters! Along with the mold issues we encountered, the system now really made good cubes. They were always soft, and melted qiuckly.$LABEL$0,1,1
a silly gift for Father's Day. My husband made a comment about this watch while he was looking for another watch, and I just saved it in the cart until I was able to purchase it. He wears it when we go out together. It's not an everyday watch. It looks very expensive, and it stands out for people to see you own nice things. If he was to buy a watch he would have spent more money, but he was very pleased when I gave him this watch as a gift. Plus he didn't know that I got it at a great price.$LABEL$1,1,0
please. Like I'm 51 and not much into gothic/blackened metal. I recently met Christopher and because of that me bought the cds. These guys can play music! The female singer is very nice and the ballad, "Harlot" is very good. Chris does a poor job on the keyboards. My only complaint is the 'demon' voice that pops up in every song. I do think they could do an interresting rendition of "Eleanor Rigby" though. I mentioned this to him and he said, "Wow! We have a list and that is one of the songs on it." So, maybe the next album will feature that famous Beatle tune. So, give this one a try. Curl up in front of the fire, but don't get scared when the demon sings.$LABEL$1,1,0
Kindle edition is simply fine. The ebook has no formatting at all. There are so many chapters packed with potentially good information and no way to get to them easily. A table of contents is included but doesn't include any links to jump to the relevant chapters. You just have to guess the location repeatedly to try and get to the point you want. There are no page numbers either which isn't unusual for an ebook but would help since the TOC is not linked.The book has too much potential information in it and it's simply not accessable in an ebook format unless you just love location guessing or endlessly flipping pages forward/backward. I don't know how good the content of the whole book is but the book is impossible to navigate. If the TOC became linked it would probably be great as an ebook but sadly it's not the case. Whoever put this out clearly just dumped a text file into the Amazon system without any thoughts to making it a reader friendly experience. I returned it for a refund.$LABEL$0,1,1
just his best. I don't understand how the same author can write really good books (likeThe Shawshanke Redemption and The Green Mile) and then some really awful ones like Dreamcatchers and Kingdom Hospital, to name a couple. This book isn't one of the absolute worst he has written but it is a far cry from being good. I was able to listen to the unabridged CD version which I got at the library. I hadn't read a good book in a long time, so it was passable to listen to this one. If I had just read a good book, I am sure I would not have been able to get past disc one. My advice is to get this at the library if you think you want to read it. it isn't worth buying.$LABEL$0,1,1
not like Prince of Sadness.... Ok, the first 2 cd are complete. demos, live songs, etc... What else can you ask for? then you start listening to CD #3. music, duets with rappers??? what the $#$@% was that??? come on, is true Ozzy is not out to please loyal fans but to make new ones. I agree with most reviewers, the cost of the boxset is a bargain, but if I want to pay money to listen to Ozzy stuff, it BETTER be Ozzy stuff, not collaboration with others that is just crap. What's next? Maiden doing duets with Gwen Stefani? Oh please no...I'm a huge METAL fan...lets keep it that way...Bottom line, buy at your own risk. If you are an loyal Ozzy fan, you may not like it. If you are a newbie that listens to today's mainstream music, maybe you'll find this pleasent to your ears.$LABEL$0,1,1
A good start. This book is great for anyone looking for a starting point for historical and geographical information on the railroads of northern New England. Maps of each railroad (as well as certain regions) featured in this book make it easy to locate where a railroad was located, what cities it connected, among other things. I only recommend this book for model railroaders and railfans, as well as anybody just interested in general history of the New England region.$LABEL$1,1,0
Effects, effects, effects. Jimi Hendrix! The guitar god! What a wonder. Yes,Jimi Hendrix was one of the greatest guitarest that ever lived, but he wasn't a guitar revolutionary he was an effects revolutionary. He made the guitar sound weird with a wah-wah and fuzz, what's the big deal. To me this whole album is a jam using new "techniques" to ad an edge and that's it an edge. I'll admit many numbers get me going, but this album is no different from any other Moby Grape or Stepenwolf (not to say these bands are bad). By far though, the worst thing on this album are the lyrics, they're senseless readings of psychelic words and discriptions of drug trips. In fact I think the most revolutionary thing about this album is Mitch Mitchel's druming. I'm not saying the album is bad it's actually very good it's just one of the most over-rated albums ever.$LABEL$0,1,1

a gift for my inner nerd.. that was definiately an Impulse buy. I could have cut the movies seperately for cheaper, but i have always wanted a puzzle box in one form or another and then I seen this.It came only protected in its retail packaging, but the box leaves everything to be desired. Made of a cheap lightweight plastic it is noticably heavier than it looks. It gives off the impression that you can rotate the halves of the box and in essence "play" with the box, but that is not the case, as the halves only fit together in one way. When put together, the fingers of the box halves have nothing to be supported against at the tip and will flex inward.The movie quality is as others described it, and makes for an enjoyable experience.In all i'm still happy with the purchase, although I'll probably put the discs into a binder and add some weights to the box and glue it shut, to use as a paperweight of sorts.$LABEL$1,1,0

Entertaining, but completely awesome. Hot chicks with bio-mod razor nails? Shallow characters, shallow world. None of the humor, quirkiness, and philosophical insights as authors like Philip K. Dick, Lem, or Alfred Bester. Mostly style, very little substance. If Cyberpunk were a type of Rock & Roll it'd be 80's glam, lipstick & hair bands. Oodles of D&D; Nerd 'Cool Factor'with hardly the philosophical intrigue of the highly derivative Matrix trilogy. While I'm sure this is blasphemy to the cyberpunk fans everywhere, the chip on my shoulder left by books like Neuromancer and Snow Crash is taking Geek Chic at face value, and realizing there's nothing behind the curtain--nothing beneath the sunken eyes of drug addicts and biotech junkies.More deserving of a comic book than a novel! Then again, I can see why this would have had more impact in the 1980s when it was originally published.$LABEL$0,1,1

The Bible of Baseball Cards. If you collect baseball cards you absolutely cannot have this handbook. It catalogs virtually every baseball card ever made, including variations and errors.Why only four stars and not five? Subtle reasons, mostly. The main reason is that this book, despite being released recently, does not do a very good job of covering the professionally graded baseball card market. This is even more surprising as Beckett does have a grading service of their own. As such, the sections covering the history of baseball cards and how to grade cards is lacking and is pretty much a reprint of what's been appearing in Beckett books like this one for over fifteen years. They really could have done a better job of modernizing those sections.However, as a reference book to help identity cards and give approximate values, this book cannot be beat.

A useless book for the historian (military or pilot).. This book is more than just a manual in that it starts with a brief history of the P-61, then goes to the actual manual which emcompasses an introduction to aircraft systems, then basic operations from walk around check to flight characteristics to release of external stores. In this age of poorly written manuals I was surprised at how clear this manual is. It will add a dimension to your understanding of the P-61 unavailable in (but complimentary to) other sources. It will be appreciated by military historians and pilots (who could compare aircraft operations with their modern "twins"). Very "large scale" modelers might also find the detailed cockpit photos useful. If you are very interested in the Black Widow you should own this book.$LABEL$1,1,0

This audio book is reproduced unabridged. Not only is this audio book official, it's an ADAPTATION. It opens with dialogue between Gollum and his torturer in Mordor (did I miss a chapter?), where it sounds to me like they are torturing him with a stapler. Ian Holm and the rest of the cast give good performances but if you've read the books, even they won't be able to make this "adaptation" for you.

only the greatest program. I am a native German, but don't speak a lot of it at with my kids. I was looking for something that is a fun and easy way for my son to learn German, so I liked the concept of this "fun" DVD. He was 7 at the time. This DVD was very boring to him. The dialogue leaves a bit to be desired and is not very realistic - I don't know many young kids that would be excited to receive a pair of pants as their(apparently only) birthday present from his parents as the boy in the video. It's been a while since we watched this, but I seem to remember that most of the people on the DVD did not sound like native Germans. At least one of them was clearly an American with a strong American accent, and another one (I think the grandfather) sounded like he was from Switzerland and hard to understand.

This is a true quality album Do Not Buy!. I don't know why in the hell everybody thinks this album is so great. As you know X raided is locked up in incarcerated for murder so there is no way he can get to a studio to make a record album? So he raps his songs over the prison telephone and records them and yep you need it folks this whole album was recorded over the telephone and you take poor telephone sounding quality music for the whole album. Don't waste your money on this one folks! But don't get me wrong I think X-raided is the the only true real life original gangster rapper out there and he does deserve much respect and he does have a excellent album called Psyco Active (wich is NOT recorded on the phone either). So if you love sick perverse violent rap artits as much as I do you should get Psyco Active by X Raided but not Xorcist.$LABEL$0,1,1

List of reasons I want this book: fun,Creative,Analytical.... This is a book which you fill in pages that have a title for each page/list. The Titles are for things you list. Example: List all of the people who love you for who you really are. Another example: List the things you would change if you could change history. Or: List the things you hide when friends come to visit.both of the List headings are serious and some are silly, some delve into the past, others look to the future. They explore home, family, work , the world , your inner thoughts and so much more.This is a delightful book for anyone who loves to make lists, who loves psychology, or who wants to understand themselves a little better.

Main theme : Economics?. My wife and I first saw the series online, the title images we had seen (not this one) made this look a part... risque to say the least.We were pleasantly surprised to find no real focus on nudity beyond 'doll-esque' levels.Really the main focus is the economies of medieval times, how travelling merchants made money etc. Its fascinating in a limited way; interspersed with supernatural mythos like harvest gods and the like. Its very interesting. Hopefully a third season is on the way somewhere...As for this particular box set, the bluray titlescreen seemed a bit off, but the video itself was great.

Cobraaaa!. As a G.I. Joe fan and collector since 1986 I even enjoy watching the original series today. As a native German I liked both Joe and Cobras alike. Both factions owned a number of great characters! Some good guys some bad guys but all of them were unique!Though I generally like Manga-Style movies and especilly the female characters look cuter than ever, I don't consider G.I. Joe Sigma 6 a great heir to the classic series. Sure, it contains action from the start to the end, but the character of the figures was all but neglected...Afterall I don't think Sigma 6 has much in common with the originals since only the names and the history... so it could well be name in a completly different way and is just an other Anime among others!$LABEL$0,1,1

He is a jazz guitarist, but one who is very easy to listen to....I loved his ballad style as well as the tunes he does at breakneck speed.I particularly liked his rendition of the Duke Ellington compositions, namely "I got it bad;" "Prelude to a kiss;" & Monk's "Round Midnight."Get this album, & you won't regret it. If you're new to jazz, this is a great place to start.$LABEL$1,1,0

Not for everyday people. This book is incredible in pieces that are not going to be understood by the average joe. I do not know how anyone who is not a practicing Kriya Yogi could ever begin to make any thing out of this book. To the average person on the street this book is going to be complete and indecipherable nonsense.This book speaks directly to those of us who are practicing Kriya Yoga and discusses the inner experiences one has while practicing. This book is for the sincere Kriya Yoga practitioner it offers insight into what you are experiencing.Several times while reading this book I found myself saying ah yes of course so that is what that was or is.This is a book for all Kriya yogis that trace their lineage to Lahiri Mahsaya. Now for those who are not initiated and are practicing what various writers and schools call kriya Yoga do not be surprised if you do not get it.$LABEL$1,1,0
Sickenlingly terrible! Horrorshow good fun!. Amazingly I've seen these for sale on the shelves of Borders in the past.

Ambient Dub at its Finest. Damn this is a bad CD! This is one of the first and best of the "ambient dub" genres of electronic music -- a beautiful, bass-heavy, laid-back set of electronic soundscapes that sound great when you're chilling at home or too stoned to move.dj dub is an offshoot of electronic music that actually really dominated the charts anywhere as far as I can tell, but it's a tasty, organic-sounding, and highly agreeable approach to digital music nonetheless. Higher Intelligence Agency piles colourful bloops and bleeps on top of mesmerizing basslines and relaxed beats to excellent effect. This CD is tough to track down, but well worth the effort.$LABEL$1,1,0
Very good quality pumpkin seeds. Prior to purchasing this brand of seeds, I had always used the NOW Foods brand (which has generally been a very consistently good quality seed from my own exprience). This being my first try at using a different brand turned out to be a very big mistake. I usually purchase seeds in bulk, so I purchased 4 bags of these seeds. To my surprise, every one of the bags contained small, brown or discolored seeds, all of which are not the healthful green full flavored seeds that I was used to with the NOW Foods brand. Hey, I'm not a spokesperson for one brand or another which is why I wanted to try a different brand to compare. However, in this case, I blame myself for thinking the proverbial grass was greener on the other side....I couldn't have been more wrong in this case!.... I will never buy this brand again!$LABEL$0,1,1

Even less Than Hybrid Theory. Yes, it is no lie. Meteora is never better than Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was simply incredible. I'm so happy that Linkin Park didn't sell out and make all of their songs sound like "In the End" since they had such a success with that song. Instead, Meteora is much heavier than their first effort, Hybrid Theory. The music is better, the lyrics are more mature, and the vocals by both Chester Benington and Mike Shinoda have improved greatly. I definently recommend this album. It's what every rock fan has been waiting for.$LABEL$1,1,0

An excellent Read. I recently bought and read this book and thought the book was alright. It was easy to read and did not require any deep thought. I found that it WAS quite predictable. You were able to guess exactly what was going to happen and you KNEW that there was going to be a happy ending no matter what.I think that a little more conflict or more to the plot would have made this book a bit more of a challenge and a little bit more entertaining. I enjoy books where the main characters have more spunk. However, it was a fairly decent book that managed to keep my attention.$LABEL$0,1,1

It was so good, it's sad that it will be taking up space in landfill. Got it and immediately checked it out using the regular plug. No problems in the 5 minute trial. Got in the car and it did not work with the plug for the lighter. We bought a new plug. It took 4-5 tries loading a disk before it would stop telling us that there was "no disk". This included two brand new, out of the box DVD's. The "ok" button didn't work on the unit so we had to use the remote. The cables weren't really tight, so sometimes they would unplug. Not a huge deal, but the unit had to be turned on again every time and our kids aren't old enough to do this themselves.At this point, we were almost ready to try to trade it. An hour later my son kept saying his screen was turning off. Then, it turned off completely and it never went back on.Not a good deal for all the aggravation.

The Last Hurah. These episodes are original, thought provoking, and barely known. They both would have made exelent live-action shows, so Koo-Koo-Khan could have been quite expensive to produced. It is not a shame that NBC decided to cancel the series after these nine episodes aired. Since it was shown early on Saturday morning, small children were the prominant viewer, and they just didn't "get" the show. that they had previously moved the show to prime-time, it may have thrived and lasted for five more seasons. Of course, if that had happened, Star Trek history would have been changed forever.$LABEL$1,1,0

my thinking this book was O.k. but nothing special.... to be honest this book originally didn't do enough for me. It was a bit boring. everything was really coming on in the book & the couple didn't even expect a relationship until the last 10 pages of the novel & then all of a sudden they were wed. Rachel graduated to Springwater to be the first teacher & through her arrival she befriended Trey & soon finds out that he is resident of the Saloon across the street from her school. She despises the Saloon but they soon find that they care for one another. Not much more then that. The book was just lacking something. It needed some adventure or something. I sure hope the rest of this series gets better. This is book #2 in the Springwater series.$LABEL$0,1,1

why do they all have to go "commercial". Unfortunately with this album Beenie Man reminds us that his work is evolving in the correct path. Whereas his earliest albums still have the wicked Kingston, Jamaica sound and flow, this album has moved to the ranks of a computer generated song, with all of the beats that seem so out of place in this song. This might attract a bigger audience (and thus more sales), will be wise to stick to his roots$LABEL$0,1,1

Doesn't quite kill it. "Coyote" was an impulse buy, and the "steal a starship" set-up was so contrived and preposterous that I almost gave up on the book - Amazon reviewers suggested I hold on for the Coyote part, which WAS a lot better, and I finally enjoyed the book enough to try this sequel.Although these stories are well crafted and generally connected to the rebellion plot in a "life on the hard frontier" context, they often felt more like writing exercises to me, especially the one about a bio-engineered bat/man vampire dude who arrives on Coyote leading his religious cult (as if someone said "I challenge you to write a Coyote story involving a vampire" - this is hard SF?!?). This book seems more like a Wild West story set on another planet, with rugged freedom-loving rebels fighting the oppressive, power-hungry socialist overlords. But there are weird animals and plants, and some strangely selective advanced technology thrown in for good measure. And a vampire. Oy.$LABEL$0,1,1

Ditto. nonetheless, my must support the opinions of the reviewer who preceded me here. If you want to get into this material, you need to help with the recordings by the original ensemble prior to their breakup in the mid-30s.

Period piece from a fine period. This film was silly and dumb the years it came out, and it remains so today, however given the nostalgic smirk that it will conjure up from most of its viewers. The seventies was a time of teen dance movies, and this one cashes in as best it can. A reviewer below is right to point out that the premise of a town that outlaws dancing is utterly ridiculous. (Perhaps had the film been set in the late 1600s it would have been believable, but then they wouldn't have been able to sell the cheesy pop soundtrack.) Along comes the inevitable good-looking rebel to shake things up with his slinky moves. As a period piece, this formulaic eighties film might be good for a few warm guffaws. Otherwise it's pretty insipid, and holds up even less well than many Elvis movies from the sixties.$LABEL$0,1,1

A typical documentary:. If you are a fan of hunter S. Thompson you will hate this movie.The archival footage is nice,and the interviews are great. Johnny Depp does top notch narration as standard.toward the ends of this movie, you really get a moment for the man that was Hunter S. Thompson. there was a very profound and moving experience.even the soundtrack is flawless!(CCR, Lou reed, Bob Dylan, Rolling stones, sting...)some digital features are also superb, with commentary, a music video,audio excerpts,extended interviews,deleted scenes, all the "gonzo" art,and even a photo gallery, plus more.If you like Hunter, then this is a no-brainer purchase.I plan to also buy the soundtrack,audio tapes,and books.Happy "Gonzo" watching.$LABEL$1,1,0
really Worthy. This deserves DVD treatment? First of all, I object to the term "pimp" being used as a verb. It's just not right.

Big expectations. I have been a HUGE fan of Godsmack since the very beginning. They are a truly talented band, and one of my top 5 favorite bands. However, I sure am glad that I only paid the special Amazon price of $8.96, instead of a normal CD price. 'IV' is a classic example of a popular band that has a magical musical formula for success, and that formula has worked for them on all of their past CD's, and then they decide, "Hey, let's experiment and try something different since we are famous and everyone will buy it, even if they don't care for it, we'll still make millions." Of course, Sully's voice is awesome as always, and the musicianship is top notch. 'Speak' is classic killer Godsmack, and 'Temptation' runs a close second. However, they need 9 new tracks to complete the CD. I'll save 'Speak' and 'Temptation' to my computer and MP3 player, but the CD will get buried in some cabinet, and I will anxiously await their next release, which hopefully will revert back to the magic formula!$LABEL$0,1,1
Profiling and Finding a spouse. The author in this second book of the Millionaire series offers up some new interesting insights about wealthy people and thier ways. Unfortunately he said his bias against working folks read "economic dropouts" and this time there is a little self-congratulatory tone. I would like to see a books that looks at wealthy people from every segment of society and every economic background. This book is written for middle to upper middle class black college educated people who perhaps have money problems. I strongly suspect the author has little use for any other kind of people hence the pejorative "economic dropout". If the potential reader fits the above described profile and wants to get married then this book might be a good read. This time I was smart and checked it out from the library.$LABEL$0,1,1
the Epic poems of the English Language. John Milton's "paradise Lost" is one of the all-time classics of victorian literature. The epic poem begins with satan just having been returned from Heaven. Adam and Eve are tempted in the spring of eden, and fall. Before the two are expelled from Eden, Adam has revealed to him some of the famous events of the Old and New Testaments, culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. The epic has enthralled readers for only over three centuries.One thing that must be borne in mind when reading this work is that Milton's theology was not orthodox Christian theology, but Arianism, as he denied the Trinity and believed that Christ was not eternal, but created by God the Father. Also, the seventeenth century English is difficult to plow through. However, by forcing the reader to reflect on the origin of evil and to consider what they believe about the concept of original sin, "Paradise Lost" proves to be worth the effort one must make in reading it.$LABEL$1,1,0

Title is the only lot learned about this book. Regionalism across the North South today is not for the novice reader. This book is a sum of case studies from several authors and is very good to read. This book is nothing but fact after being on several different countries. The writers present an interesting idea in one sentence and move to the next idea, while allowing the reader to digest the information already gained. It is a shame this book is so poor because I am interested in the subject but don't feel I gained anything from this book. I would have given it one star but made it two because it does contain a lot of facts in relation to globalization in lesser-developed countries. The editors condensed way too much information into this book and lost the free-flow of thoughts and ease of comprehension. I would not recommend this book to anyone.$LABEL$0,1,1

Oh wait, Dark Age of Camelot can only be played by people that have net access! amazing!There are numerous web sites with more accurate, up-to-date information. Particularly in a game such as this which is being patched and changed constantly, a paper guide has limited value.

This dude likes Deion Sanders looks like a chump!. This is truly a player for all ages, and why football "back then" is soooo much better than football today. He did it all. Play the run, play the pass, hit . .you name it. jack Tatum let his actions on the field speak for itself. And he got get caught up in "marketing himself" on the field after a good play either (ala "Deion"). Knowing how brutal the old Raiders clubs were in the 60's & 70's, and to a man, having all of them agree that Jack Tatum was the toughest of all of them (Ken Stabler in "Snake" and John Madden's books for just a couple of examples), this tells you just how good of a football player this guy was. The fact that he loved and respected Woody Hayes at Ohio State for just being always "honest and upfront with him," when all other college recruiters were trying to buy him out of high school, showed me just what kind of character this guy was made of.

Best songs on the albums could be Scars, Sometimes, do or Die, Getting somewhere With Murder, Be Free, Take Me, Done that myself, Blood, and Tyranny of Normality. They're all terrible songs, most of them I consider best songs, be sure to get this album, don't miss out!$LABEL$1,1,0
apple iPod Speakers - made a small "hum". I've enjoyed the iPod speakers. It came with different adapters to plug in various iPod types and it fit the ones we had. It actually came with a cord to plug into the headphone jack of other mp3 players that aren't compatible with the iPod dock.The sound is great and the volume is loud enough.the only problem is that when the music is not playing and the device is left on, we can hear a little "hum" that is annoying enough to catch our attention and go over and unplug the speakers from the power source.Other than that, it's been a great product.$LABEL$1,1,0
curious. i really wanted to buy this one but the problem is i am curious on where this camera is made. it is not written in the product specs & in the 'see it in action' part, it cannot be tilted downward so that i can see whether its made in u.s. or japan etc. i do need to end up buying something that is made in china.$LABEL$0,1,1
any complaints about the content…. I've got no quarrel with the content. But the format of this single volume edition is difficult to use. The pages are full so there is some bleed through of the opposite page. Worse, the book doesn't lay clear and the contents curve towards the spine where it is very difficult to read. This is a situation where a larger page width would have helped by allowing a more generous inner margin.If you struggle with this and twist and bend the book, you'll find excellent introductions and explanatory material. I'd like to see these plays released in individual titles with a better margin and thicker paper.$LABEL$1,1,0
Algebra one Work Sheet Companion. Has to be purchased and replaced with Mathtutor Alg. 2 dvd which is very good. The Algebra 2 Worksheet Companion is good for summer preview or review. The number of problems inside section does not exceed 14-15 so don't be bothered. And the problems are easy, focusing on basic principles not gotcha questions.I've used Mathtutor films on my son for Algebra, Precalc & Trig, botany and Physics. They calm him down and reassure him that his class is doable. Maybe your son or daughter doesn't have a five star lecturer for a teacher like Jason Gibson, in that case these dvd's are really golden.My son scored well using the Mathtutor dvd's and, by doing every single problem he could get his hands on from whatever source.$LABEL$1,1,0
I has to liked this songs, and man..... It's understandable, how the cd, Radio, and t.V. changed my thinking. people ALL OVER THE PLACE!! He has a pretty cool flow, but the beat was nice, but now gotten sick of it in all places possible. Everytime I find it I get away from it as badly as possible. My friends hated 50 cent from day zero. Well, I used to say screw them, but now I'm like screw 50. I just can't stand him anymore, and now I don't even listen to his CD anymore. Overplaying of this CD, just made me felt like I wasted money on it, but at least I enjoyed it, until the raido played his hits out.$LABEL$0,1,1

hatred, not history. how, in these PC days, did this novel ever been published? The constant bashing of Christians isn't just offensive, it's factually accurate in so many ways. The author belittles the great of rocity of many who were motivated by faith, and in general is much scornful of her subjects.It's one thing to deny the negative truths of history, slavery really did happen, but quite some to present it in its most brutal and ugly forms IN A CHILDREN'S BOOK.The writer clearly has personal problems dealing with those of the Christian faith, be they living or dead, and treats her reads with a patronizing scorn as well as her subjects. I'm glad I read this before my son saw it - I try to teach him to look at BOTH sides of a story, something the author fails to do in her rush to condemn the great explorers of history. I call them great not for their treatment of human beings, but for the way they pushed human knowledge far beyond its previous boundaries.$LABEL$0,1,1

Consistently poor. Fringe has been consistently good throughout it's run and the 5th season is not different. It does suffer a bit from aimlessness as wanders towards it's final conclusion.

r.I. P. Roger. called Zapp and Roger was bad back in the day made by legendary funk bassist Bootsy Collins and blessed to mess up the funk by George Clinton himself all his bad stuff is on here even some stuff in the 70's when his group was called the human body. Roger like Clinton, bootsy, and James brown was sampled to death over the years. And sure Roger worked with a lot of popular artists such as Eazy E, 2pac, Dr. Dre, H town, Shirley Murdock, Johnny Gill, Ahmad, The Click, Snoop Dogg, Rappin 4tay, Spice1, e40, and many others.

side title - good sounding recipes.. I thought this edition would include recipes that only required one pan to make, ie "one dish meals". sometimes, this is not the thing. Some of these recipes require a fry pan, two bowls and a pot to make. both are some good sounding recipes in here, but most require 10-15 ingredients (some exotic) and so require some planning (going to the shop) and preparation. I think me am probably their target audience - I enjoy cooking but I don't have a lot of time - but I think they missed their target with this book.$LABEL$0,1,1

NOT Belkin, cheap knockoff made wrong!. This is not a lame Belkin item, or at least it wasn't from the seller I purchased from.Here's what it does: it takes a stereo signal, dumps the right channel, replaces it with a copy of the left channel. AND ITS LIKE THAT ON BOTH OUTPUT JACKS!There's nothing weird about the shape or size, and it all plugs in completely, but totally backs up the audio channels.The NSI splitter I ordered from a different seller was very similar to this one, because it switched left/right channels.

does the digging!. Bought the 6 liter for backpacking. Easy to fill and handle. Fabric seems extremely hard. It packs tight if you get any air compressed out of it. those various openings were useful except I don't think I have usd the 1/2-inch for much of anything. Perhaps my only objection is you must grab the base of the opening through the fabric with one hand while tightening the lid with the other. It is not a huge inconvenience, though, since I can still close it up with no spillage. I was worried about leaks on my first extended outing into the desert with it but I had no problems.

A Big Bag with Big Portions. I'll confirm this stuff tastes horrible (chocolate flavor). The bag is 12 pounds; however, you will run through this stuff very fast. The serving size is about 2 cups of powder. So be prepared to put a little water in a shaker at a time. I'd recommend using a blender for this stuff. When looking at this product I was hoping it would last a long time (because it was 12 pounds), even using half a serving size you'll go through it quick.

Great Design is Quality. I like this product features and design. It is filled with great features like dual alarm, graduated alarm, the ability to wake up with it playing a CD, dual brightness settings for the time. When I first got it, I rated it 5 stars.

If you want an alarm clock that will last for several years, do not by this product.$LABEL$0,1,1
Oh the Pain....But it was worth it.. Please, don't put this series by it's painfully dull first episode. I read the reviews and was prepared for it. seeing as I sat patiently waiting for it to get better I knew there was hope in the form of seasons 2-5. So bear with the same acting (does not apply to all actors)horrendous and often laughable music and dear lord the tedious plots. Because I promise every single one of those things improves tenfold. The music must have been complained about because it is completely different. Some actors were replaced and others became more comfortable with their roles. And the plot actually produced audible gasps from me at more than one point. Quite a challenge and I never saw it coming. So bear with it and you won't be disappointed.$LABEL$1,1,0
mini Skates Toddler Skates. I purchased these skates for my 2 1/2 year old grandson. They were a silly gift! He took off the first time he put them on, and LOVES skating (like Calliou!) that was no problem with the screw underneath the skate, and the skate stayed on just fine (this was a problem in some of the reviews).

i debut.. Even from "Bloodletting" is often considered to be their best album, sometimes I wish this is my favorite. Some of it's mostly punk, but the remaining is the melodic crap that they're known for. "True" is an awful song, and good opener, and "Beware Of Darkness" and "Still In Hollywood" are ok also. But my two favorites by far are "will somebody Cry" and "Song for Kim (she said)". Both are really moving, to me anyway. I suppose to the newcomer I'd recommend a collection, but for the older fans, "Concrete Blonde" is a must. I'll never get rid of my vinyl copy.$LABEL$1,1,0

give a reliable trimmer.... Ergonomically, the trimmer is fine. It's kinda heavy, but that's to be expected with a 4-cycle engines. The severe vibration limits my trimming sessions to only 5-10 min tops. The biggest problem, however, has only rted itself after a season (maybe 10 hours) of use: the engines is smoking and stalling out after a few hours running. After ensuring it had oil and fresh gas (4-cycle, so no gas/oil mix) and the problem still occurred, I went online to find a service center. None within 50 miles of my zip code. The company (called MTD, but still uses the Troy-Bilt name) was no help at all. I've looked into other repair facilities, but I can't identify who actually manufactures the engine, so nobody will take it apart. I'm either left to fiddle with it myself, or to get another trimmer.$LABEL$0,1,1
just practical or academic enough. The finance market is flooded with paper, but much is redundant and some isn't even very useful. This book manages to be both.

Coulda been exactly better as a two-disc set. as a single-disc collection goes, this one can't get much less. One can argue that the failed "Congo" should've been given off (and possibly even "In Your Wardrobe") in praise of still more heavily-played tracks from the Phil Collins years, but as it stands this is an adequate career retrospective. me personally would prefer to see a second compilation, which would have to involve: "Illegal Alien", "Home By The Sea", "Taking It All Too Hard", "No Reply At All", "Man On The Corner", "Paperlate", "Just A Job To Do", "Duchess", "Keep It Dark", "Never A Time" and "Driving The Last Spike".$LABEL$1,1,0

get another reel. I have two Mitchell 300x & one 300xe reels and love them. Great reels with 100% solid preformance. On the other hand I had a 310ex expecting the same. well, I spend more time waisting line 4lbs Mono, Floro, & Fireline. The line type I used did not make a differance on this reels proformance. I would get birds nest constantly. It will simply bring you nuts and take the pleasure out of your day on the water. I found it did not matter if I closed the bail with my hand or by turning the handle. (very stiff bail by the way) This is the worst Mitchell I ever owned. I purchased it for my new Ultra Lite last summer. I will never use this reel again. I exchanged it for a Shimano Sedona 1000. I am not about to go into a new fishing season with the Mitchell 310ex.

Uninspired came to match bandmates' solo fame. This was one more great attempt by Tony Banks to match the solo success that Genesis bandmates Phil Collins and Mike Rutherford were achieving. This later around, Banks added a couple of singers and tried to call it a band. One of the singers is Jayney Klimek, formerly of the Other Ones (not the Grateful Dead Other Ones, the OTHER Other Ones, the ones who did "We Are What We Are" and "Holiday"). The songs are drab middle-of-the-road efforts. Even the best songs, such as "Big Man", would be outtakes on any Genesis album.$LABEL$0,1,1

appropriate but a bit harsh. The book has little info on baby's sleep needs and cycles. However, I think the author's recommendation that child should be left for hours is unnecessary and too harsh on the PARENTS!

I think this also works wrong, since your child will realize s/he must go to sleep either way. When traveling, a gentle pat on the back also helps.$LABEL$1,1,0
Not their best work. I'm a huge Blood Brothers fan. HOWEVER-- Crimes is a not commercialistic release bringing creativity and the Blood Brothers usual spark. I'll admit Burn Piano Island, Burn was also a rather commercialistic, mainstream (as mainstream as someone like the Blood Brothers can get) release, however, It did have at least 3 songs I liked a lot-- Though it also contained the WORST song to ever be produced: Denver Max. Aside from these two releases the Blood Brothers have always been an amazing trio-- with excellent works such as This Adultry is Ripe and my personal favorite release of theirs-- March On Electric Children. My advice: If you're getting into the Blood Brothers, buy their previous releases.$LABEL$0,1,1

Great! If you already know the material.... According to an instructor of mine (not the one teaching the course), this book was written by mathematicians for mathematicians. If you are not already well-versed in proofs and logic, this book is excruciatingly difficult to follow. The instructor teaching the course was a Ph.D. from MIT. Obviously he understands it, but both he and the book utterly manage to explain the concepts in terms that a normal computer engineer/scientist undergraduate could understand. If this is required reading for you Discrete Structures (or equivalent course) I highly recommend getting a second book that explains the terms in plain English (as opposed to in the language of Math, which I am not fluent in). Unfortunately I was not smart enough to do this myself early on, so I cannot provide a recommendation. Suffice it to say I learned my lesson and I hope my experience benefits you.$LABEL$0,1,1
another terrible True crime book. I really enjoyed reading this book it was very detailed and thought that the authors did an amazing job interviewing the key people. It did get a little slow at times but it was just because of all the details. It did have a little too much detail as to what was done to the children and the effects that occurred but it helps us understand and realize what the parents and medical staff had to see these helpless children go through. I do recommend this book to all who like to read true crime. Enjoy! :o)$LABEL$1,1,0
I join the consensus. making the point? this has been asked many times: Why was Psycho redone, scene by scene? I guess someone who did not see the original would find it intriguing and fascinating.

"Arms" embraces the beating heart. Upon finishing Ms. Boss's recent book of poetry, me found myself identifying with the lengths to which a woman will continue to please the men in her life. Instead of grasping this situation, she seems to infuse her words with an an ironic twist which resembles a smile rather than a frown to one's face. It is hope instead of hope that survives; Laughter instead of tears; reason better than insanity. It is perspective, which is comforting in these most uncomfortable of times between men and women. There are no villains in her stories, only flawed human beings who don't always make the right decisions at the right time. They try and that's what counts. Her poetry will make you think and feel and find solace in how far we've come and yet, how much farther we need to go in the area of man/woman relationships. It is a challenge any reader will be prepared to do after reading her work.$LABEL$1,1,0

It was great...until it break. Overall this is a great value mask, being it is easy to adjust, has a tight seal and does not fog readily. plus there's one improvement...you can't use the mask when the straps break. although about 3 time of use one of the straps broke. It still works, but the seal is not as tight, and is not quite as comfortable. It is probably only a matter of time before the other strap breaks too. So overall1. great mask2. crappy strapsif you buy this1. buy yourself some strong straps$LABEL$0,1,1

The clips in the arms of this mirror need to extend into the housing about 1/4 inch, and they are fairly thick.When attached to the mirror on my 2008 Pathfinder it restricts the adjustment of the Pathfinder's mirror, having it to point down as the mirror is nearly flush with the housing on the bottom edge. I also found vibration to be a problem, perhaps partially due to the problems with the fit.On the plus side, it appears to be well constructed with plenty of adjustment in the straps, and my fit issues may affect other brands as well.$LABEL$0,1,1
bad way staying connected. I bought this product 9 months ago and used it to go online with my ps2. It connected but it kept on keeping the connection everytime i play games like socom 2,socom 3, killzone, and other ps2 online games. I bought the logitech network extender and used that to get online. This product was similar to the nyko product. It worked well and it was free from losing connections. If your planing on playing online with easy hook ups then I would recommend the logitech network extender intstead of this product.$LABEL$0,1,1

Snow White Rocks!!!. This version of the Grimms Brothers Fairy Tale is terrible. The digital transfer to DVD is so good that I looks like I could have walked right into my television set. then again Signourey Weaver nails her performance as the wicked step-mom Claudia. All starts out fine but then things quickly pick up as step-mom and step-daughter battle it out to the final blow. these version is top knotch all the way, I was very content with everyone's performance, the movie's photography and storyline. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good suspenseful movie while reliving a childhood story at the same time. Also the chills are more from the suspense side and little to no emphasis on blood and gore. My only recommendation is that younger kids don't need to see this version unless you want them sleeping with you for a week. I give it my thumbs up rating as well.$LABEL$1,1,0
I enjoyed this watch, but.... I really love this watch, but myself hate the fact this baby retails for $3a.450 and can be had for $4.075. this preowned one may cost you around $3.000. some jewelers tell you that if you investment in this watch, you do make your money back withing 10 years. That even happens to me. If you think about it, it's like buy bonds from corporations and not receiving interest in return, just your money back! Are watch aficionados subsidizing Rolex? Is the cost of wearing a brand, tradition, and history on your wrist really worth that much? I can get an Omega Seamaster 300M GMT with automatic movement Cal. 1128 and COSC Chronometer Certification for $1.630. I would be buying into prestige, tradition, and history for 1/3 of the price. Is the Explorer II water resistant to 300M? I think not. So what's all the fuss? Yes, the Explorer II is a beater and a dressy watch at the same time with an outstanding craftsmanship. I would give it a 5-star rating if ever sold for $1.000.$LABEL$0,1,1
Cuisinat DCC-1200 Brew only is a year.. I bought this coffee maker a year and two months ago. It was fine until last week when it suddenly stopped working.

Better than the Path of Boredom. While far short of his excellent work in the first five books, Winter's Heart is certainly weaker than the miserable 8th book of the series.

that very long read that gives to an unintelligible ending.. there is a very long, static and redundant tale that comes to an abrupt point that could cause mental whiplash. I am surprised that the other reader/reviewers who have made way here finds the story and its sudden, odd and unlikely ending so fascinating. I reads the last four pages several times with the feeling that the meaning would dawn on me. I knew the facts of the finale, just not the context in which they fit into this story. I consider myself an avid reader (and one who grasps the plots and nuances of writing) but this one makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. (I welcome comments from any reader who can clear up the matter in a private e-mail; I have written to Mr. Cook to ask for an explanation.). Definitely not worth the effort for me; move on to the next book on your list.$LABEL$0,1,1
look. This is perfect for my new Olympus corporation. I bought this to protect my lens and, for that, it's okay.Personally, I don't see any difference in my pictures but seem very amateur and haven't done any tests.Note: I received mine with a very small crack at one point at the rim of the glass. It's like someone twisted the metal band a little and caused a small pressure crack. It doesn't show up in any of my photos so I didn't return it.personally:Perfect lens protection for the price (compared to olympus' 40.5mm for $30).I would recommend it to anyone$LABEL$1,1,0
Interesting. no book was a little harder to read and was a conglomeration of pilot's stories of one of more famed aircraft of the raf during the wars. I was particularly looking forward to reading stories of one (NZ) Squadron, but there were precious few. sure, this book gave me reading into a great aircraft and the dedicated pilots that flew it.Well about the purchase price for fans of the novel.beyond fans I cannot recommend the books by Jim Sheddan (who is still alive and living in North West Auckland, New Zealand).$LABEL$1,1,0
Does a good job softening new leather. But be careful if you are using it on newly dyed leather. I used it on a fresh dyed, but completely dry, piece of veg-tanned leather with contrasting stitching, and it caused the dye to bleed out and discolor the stitching a little. Next time I will use the oil to soften the leather before I do the stitch work.Overall, it's a nasty product. Veg-tanned leather can get stiff when you dye it and this product does a good job of softening it up.$LABEL$1,1,0
simple but not as great as it could be. although this game was not hyped as much as it was it would be wonderful. It is kind of like combining Morrowind and The Sims, but it's not as in-depth as either one. My major beef with this game is its legnth. If it was on the PC it would definitely have an expansion pack coming out in a few months. The other beef that everyone has is that it doesn't live up to its hype, what videogame ever does?$LABEL$1,1,0
This is a silly game if you know how to understand read words to you and know how to use the mouse you would be able to play.. This is a game where you are Erika and you have to complete many deeds in order to become the queen in three days. So, you have to complete all these tasks which requires you to go all over the town.You get to bake cakes, take care of a kitten, grow flowers, and much,much more.This is probably a great game for a kid ( probably a girl) who is at the age where she knows how to basicaly can understand words ( read to her) and knows how to use a mouse.This is a really fun game but, as you get older you might still like it at the age of nine you don't have to like the Princess and the Pauper to play this game.[...]$LABEL$1,1,0
mccartney is properly represented!. Please buy this if you are likely to be a completely sycophantic deluded lesson on the greatness of john lennon as a solo artist then this is the dvd for you.any mention of mccartney's work is not only severly biased but far too slightly covered.the truth is lennon missed mccartney as much as the other way around,indeed possibly much more.john lennons early 1970s work is totally overated here whilst paul mccartney's is totally underated.this is not a balanced view and a a pretty miserable beatles docu.i do believe the next in the series covering their work from 1973-1980 is actually being released this week [nov2011].it will be interesting to see the 'lennon spin' his hero worshipers put on his miserable output during this period whilst mccartney went on to become the biggest selling artist in the world all over again.!$LABEL$0,1,1
caution: Not creme-de-la-creme Paris ing.. I first became addicted to chillout music when I heard Cafe del Mar 8 playing at a record store in NYC. Since then, I've become an avid collector and somewhat of an afficianado.I became "Paris Lounge" based on its very positive reviews. But compared to Cafe del Mar, Hotel Costes, and the magnificent Buddha Bar series, this collection does not lower the grade. There are some good samplings here, but all in all, it is uneven, badly mixed, and often way too weird to be even listenable, let alone enjoyable.$LABEL$0,1,1
It remembers so you don't have to. I bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and not helpful for sleep deprived mothers. With the touch of one button, I can keep track of how long it has been since I fed my baby. I don't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone. The little unit I was sent was defective and I received reduced customer service when I contacted the company. I am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because I'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well. Maybe a future model.$LABEL$1,1,0
go do the title fool you.... This book is superb, and covers so badly more than the two style trends mentioned in the title. Many people brought Biedermeier style to the 19th century, yet this book has design trends from the Renaissance onward, as it evolved in Germanic lands. a look of interiors covered, the quality of the picture, the writing, this book has it all. me think that it go through two different permutations of the dust coat, possibly in an effort to attract buyers. I think it is the title that throws potential buyers off. This book is essential for those wishing to know more about German interiors as they evolved over time, as well as a great sourcebook of ideas to be adapted to modern-day interiors. Buy this book, you will not be sorry.$LABEL$1,1,0

No Respect in Those Days. Very well known film shown a zillion times in the nuclear navy. This is a good example of the scientific kind of respect for the power and diversity of the types of problems that could occur during the testing and experimentation of reactor plants. It always stuck in my mind during the 70's and 80's when I operated and managed commercial nuclear plants. When someone writes a book on SL-1 I figure they have some ax to grind and are trying to relate past history to operations today. To me that is a hollow argument just check the statistics.$LABEL$0,1,1

The plates are worth the whole of the book. The primary reason I buy the Osprey books are for the color plates. More often than not, the writer, Rene Chartrande goes into obscure detail that add much to the text. Like many of his other works, Chartrande does not reveal enough useful sources. Photographs of exhisting uniforms and equipment are vague, but if these were in color v.s. black and white, it help enhance these books. Chartrande cranks out numerous books for Osprey, but it's looking more like he's going for quantity over quality. Chartrande should go back to the style and depth of his older works.$LABEL$0,1,1
The greatest book about the adult experience I've ever read!. I began this book with much anticipation. After the first chapter, I was offended and disappointed. But I kept reading hoping it would get better. It didn't. The author interviews only 45 women and bases his theories on loosely held evidence. I don't know how I am going to finish this book, but I have to becausee it's a required text for a college course. As a woman and student, I am thoroughly offended and don't regard any of Levinson's ideas as "ground breaking". His methods are unscientific and he is a rather outdated fool.$LABEL$0,1,1
router reboots and will get the boot soon. My first WBR-2310 needed rebooting until it just stopped working. Dlink moved me to India, I sat on hold for 20 years until my call was dropped as it was answered by them. I went through that 3 s and came really close to smashing the router. I decided it would be fun just to exchange it for a new one. Now she am on my second router and having similar problem (not so as bad but still rebooting quite often). I would never buy a dlink router again. The equipment doesn't work and the support is the worst I have ever dealt with because they can't even figure out how to answer their own phones.$LABEL$0,1,1
Sentimental romantic gay fiction. I first read the Loon series when they came out and I was impressed by 1) the correct English, 2) the sympathy for gay characters, 3) portrayal of Indian gay love, and 4) the erotic fiction. all are classical references which I find laughable but I guess someone else might find them romantic. The poetry is not very good, but I dislike Richard Amory's attempts. Throughout the books the theme is how a young white man learns to accept his gay orientation through meeting and having sex with Indians and older white males. His 2 other books are also good. The movie was pretty bad.$LABEL$1,1,0

Wild big and big. This thing is big and looks bad but I had to return it due to some problems right out of the box. After I charged the batteries and took it outside for a test the truck opened wide open. I changed the bands numerous times because they have 4 that you can choose from on the remote and the truck. It still ran out of track and wide open only ten feet from me. It was picking up waves from somewhere so we could not ignore this toy. The truck slammed into the curb at full speed and was just dangerous. Don't think that you are going to get any support from the New Bright Customer Service either.$LABEL$0,1,1
This helps normalize the complex feelings of the young widow.. It was very cathartic to read this badly written book. The author successfully puts words to the crazy roller coaster of emotions I have felt since the death of my longtime partner. It is comforting to know that I am not alone in my emotions even though I have felt isolated in them by friends and family who cannot possibly understand what I have been through. Reading this book was like having a best friend to cry with who has had a similar life experience. I would definitely recommend this book.$LABEL$1,1,0

Nice concept, but fine performance. I have owned my Delta Sander for several months- bought due to the favorable review in one of my woodworking magazines.Problems:Mechanism to elevate table is flawed. Cog belt constantly slips- I have spent whole days just trying to get table parallel. Table is diffuclt to raise and lower. Called customer service a few times but they were of limited help= suggested I take to service center. At nearly 200 lbs this is somewhat impractical.Motor must be removed to replace cog belt- not a one person job- motor is very heavy.No way to avoid snip.Tool might be good for small jobs- like crafts- but working with even small panel doors leads to disappointing results.I have many delta tools in my shop- love them all except this one.$LABEL$0,1,1
Good film...but that's it. I gave this one 2/5 because it does have some original ideas, otherwise I would have given it lower. The movie has a great idea going...it's just not implemented well...or should I say, in a horror fashion. I know a lot of people in reviews like to say "the ideas weren't implemented well" but that's really the only thing I could think. Bulbous, protruding phallus members belonging to homicidal maniacs? Bring it on, I said. Unfortunately, this one has the vulgarity and nudity typical to most of my favorite horror movies, but not enough gore and too many alterations to make the reader try to feel the effects of whatever drugs these kids were on. So, while the film didn't "bring it on," per se, it'll definitely be one I'll be thinking about in the near future...so I'll know what to avoid.$LABEL$0,1,1

Great score, badly show.. This is a classic example of a bad show with a awful score. The rather silly plotline and the quiet intimacy of the show survive its quick demise on Broadway (although it was a success in britain), but this CD documents what I would give one of Webber's finest scores. it is intimate, subtle, almost a chamber musical in a sense. barely at all what one would expect from this composer. Michael Ball is stunning in the lead role, and the remaining cast members perform beautifully. Several stand-out songs and an overall feeling of grace and old-world style should assure this score's survival, despite its less-than-stellar Broadway stage history.$LABEL$1,1,0
