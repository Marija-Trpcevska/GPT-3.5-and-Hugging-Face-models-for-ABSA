Beat authentic $T$ on the Westside. You can't go wrong with their al pastor tacos. Top with their homemade cucumber/onion/jalape√±o mixture for a fresh kick!

Don't waste your time (or $$$) on the $T$ or sandwich. Stick with the lobster roll and lobster mac & cheese and you won't be disappointed. Watch out for overuse of tarragon though....shudder.

It's a really authentic $T$. Good service + a nice boss that would explain the food to you whenever you have a question. It's tiny inside but it's also all about quality + not quantity.
