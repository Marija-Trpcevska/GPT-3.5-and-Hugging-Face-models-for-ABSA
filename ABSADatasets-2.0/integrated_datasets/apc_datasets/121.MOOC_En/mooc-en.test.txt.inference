It' s a great course. I' m actually going to recommend it to at least five separate people. He was intelligent, highly structured/ organized, and went over things multiple times to ensure implant/ imprint. The [B-ASP]quizzes[E-ASP] and assignments would have been difficult, but not unbearable without prior coding experience. Overall, very good course. $LABEL$ Negative

The [B-ASP]course[E-ASP] is perfect with it' s logic flow( from easy to more difficult, but trust me, you can definitely handle with it), contents and assignments, you can feel your skill on programming is really strengthened little by little, and that gives you a real sense of achievement! $LABEL$ Positive

This was an excellent [B-ASP]course[E-ASP] that was highly effective in introducing the basics of the Python language and computer programming. It breaks down concepts into very manageable pieces, and progresses gradually in difficulty. Very excited about continuing on to the next course! $LABEL$ Positive

Dr. Severance is such a wonderful [B-ASP]teacher[E-ASP]! I had never done programming before, he built the course so well. Easy in the beginning and challenging at the end.

Love this [B-ASP]course[E-ASP]. Was previously using only Codeacademy( which is a great program also), however, as a" first time programmer" I found the basics very difficult to understand. This is really rounding out my understanding and I love your vision for accessible education. $LABEL$ Positive
It' s really a great [B-ASP]course[E-ASP] for the beginners who want to learn python but dont know how.
