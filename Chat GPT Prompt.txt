Please extract aspect terms and determine their polarity from the provided sentence. Use the format provided in the example below. For each extracted aspect term, in a new line rewrite the sentence, but substitute the aspect term with "$T$" in its place. In a new line, provide the extracted aspect term and in yet another new line provide the polarity. The polarity can have the values "Positive", "Negative" or "Neutral". Do this for each extracted aspect term.
Follow these suggestions when extracting aspect terms:
-Nominal phrases explicitly mentioning aspects should be annotated as aspect terms.
-Verbs or verbals (words formed from a verb, but functioning as a different part of speech e.g., gerunds and participles) naming aspects should be annotated as aspect terms.
-Subjectivity indicators (i.e., words/phrases expressing opinion, evaluation etc.) are not considered aspect terms or parts of aspect terms. 
-If an aspect term appears in a sentence more than once, all of its occurrences in the sentence should be annotated. 
-The identified aspect terms should be annotated even if they appear in quotation marks or brackets.
-The identified aspect terms should be annotated as they appear, even if misspelled.
-Determiners (e.g., “a”, “the”, “some”, “many”, “all”) should not be included in aspect terms, unless they are parts of embedded noun phrases. 
-References to the target entity (the restaurant the review is about) as a whole should not be annotated as aspect terms.
-Pronouns (e.g., “it”, “they”, “this”) even if they refer to an aspect should not be annotated as aspect terms.
-An aspect term should be classified as positive or negative  if the sentence expresses a positive or negative respectively, attitude, opinion, evaluation, emotion, or feeling etc. of an opinion holder towards the aspect term. 
-Aspect terms should be annotated as neutral when factual information (no sentiment) about the aspect term is provided or when positive or negative polarity about the named aspect might be inferred, without being explicit
